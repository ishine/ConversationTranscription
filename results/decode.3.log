you know we thought maybe it's indigestion or this or that and she didn't want to go to the hospital there so they went straight on home and it was hard for them it was she was in a lot of pain but she did have a heart attack oh well that's that's of course related to the stroke that she just had you know i tell you it's just one thing after another and as soon as she has gotten over one she's just hit with something else but when you talk to her she's just wonderful you know she just really tries to keep her spirits up and tries to help everybody else with kids her kids have been great and

to one person you have to hang up well [laughter] they call you back later david gonna call you back later he can do it himself maybe they okay hi largely <unk> oh i see that's why we have fifteen that's 'cause we're going to do for two phone calls well it depends we have to see if he can do it or not because when we first when we first found out about it we didn't realize it only one person can talk to one person and then they told me only one person to one person we have half an hour but i have to at least talk to you for fifteen minutes <unk> and they're going to give us a one minute warning before we have to hang up so we have one minute but i'd hang up so how are you [laughter] i'm fine i'm fine how are you haven't talked to you in a long time i feel like i've talked i talked with david almost every day [laughter] isn't that well [laughter] i don't know what there's really no difference between between writing a letter and and the way we correspond matter of fact but i do is i sit down and write a letter at my own leisure you know the word processor and then late at night i send it over you know the online or on email right and there's really no reason why we couldn't written letters like there's all these years and put them in the mailbox well you know some of this it's easier i don't know how to explain it that you saw in the email is easier yeah it's just i guess that it's no different except that you don't have to go out and get stamps and put it in the mailbox [noise] i think also that you know that someone's going to be reading it the next day not possibly in a week you know that you know that when you're saying it's gonna be heard sometimes when you write a letter you figure eventually they're going to get this and it's always gonna be old news and you know this it's more of a communication fuck you really communicating with email kind of even though it's <unk> even though there is delay but i don't know it's like cute [laughter] i get i get a kick outta pressing all those buttons and everything [noise] so tell me okay first of all you have to start a told me about all your kids [laughter] at the beginning or should i i'll start at the end okay he's very cute yeah he's he's like um he's nine month old already believe it or not [laughter] what's he doing somebody's not really like he's only like seven months old right but the truth is like all my children really only like five [laughter] lump <unk> [laughter] i would say alert he's very alert and um and very responsive and laugh and eats well hello i'm here i'm just <unk> went into <unk> can i hate that <unk> thing okay and um but he doesn't move okay well that's normal you're not worried about it that's all you know because because he was premature he's getting a lot of attention right so we go to physical therapy once a week and the truth is what i'm learning about it oh because i spend so much time with therapist is it all my kids could have used [laughter] does he get all use physical therapy 'cause we all make us more balanced people between the writing are left hemispheres and something about being organized internally gets you organized <unk> i i've learned a lot i don't know half of it is probably the <unk> but if any if it's true they all needed physical therapy [laughter] at a very young age how often they don't like <unk> how <unk> you take them i'm sorry once a week okay once a week mhm um and she doesn't like to play on his stomach <unk> likes to be on his back right <unk> as soon as you put 'em on a he can he can lift his head and everything and and now he's starting to extend his hands out even rain but he just as soon as it gets that <unk> just rolls over the place that <unk> oh no no but they they were all like that every <unk> every one of them so you don't think <unk> personally it's anything to do with him being premature personally know mhm but it doesn't hurt i see right but i see that <unk> know but it's helping mhm it's helping him be more he's advancing better i think right who knows and feeling any will find out <unk> visit yeah he's fine he's fine fine fine he was sick once with um an ear infection and once with you got this cough and he was like asthmatic mhm so you know that he had to have you know and it mask thing and <unk> and these you know but it wasn't no it home nothing's right right but <unk> but because it's <unk> those things usually return and that usually as a condition you know they prepared me for that and <unk> and i know but but the millions of kids here have it rotted kids and a lot of a game that a lot of it <unk> get it but he hasn't had another attack since so it was it's also <unk> it was fair to assume that it was the one times into and how does how does your hopes but wait how did the kids deal with him or they happy with him are they getting jealous of him okay ah yeah they're fun you know that right uh what about you know five years old i don't know <unk> you don't like them pretty much right away everyone you know they invested so much and him too at the beginning we didn't have any of the um it was just there was a novelty 'cause they waited so long to bring them home right and then you know the novelty's worn off which is good right <unk> long time [laughter] you know people have babies and their houses it's you know they're just another family with the baby in the house right and that was good <unk> which should be how do you have the kids in the house who's in which <unk> well <unk> was in a room before you got became home <unk> and <unk> himself <unk> and <unk> shared right but before we bought the baby home we switched that because <unk> room was like a bacteria haven and [laughter] when i remember when i was i was up i was like a couple before few weeks before <unk> brought him home we cleaned out the room to switch and <unk> said <unk> you can't put any baby in this room [laughter] poor noam got him back and [laughter] and you're going on you know you can <unk> you can control it better [laughter] so it's gone on and gabby and <unk> the way the way they used to be together do you still have your office as your office right i'm sitting in it right now i'm from i was in front of the computer actually when you call okay and so what's with your working what's your new working thing <unk> <unk> that's not talking about that [laughter] depressing [laughter] it is depressing or is it gives you a lot of anxiety <unk> a unbe [laughter] okay have you [laughter] i also have taboo subjects i don't want to talk about [laughter] my talking about it but i can't jam going into fifteen minutes to half an hour i mean we could talk for half an hour it's just that we have to guarantee them fifteen minutes so oh but then david won't be able to know he has his own number the thing is we have all the senator yeah we had <unk> we have a half an hour or something to do with him and i only pressing very anxiety [laughter] well you got <unk> summed it up [laughter] seriously what are your options well thorazine hate being home [laughter] i hate it i really do i hate being home you feel like you want more people interaction i i i it's a lot of well first of all i'm i'm upset about what happened i'm upset now i'm upset i wasn't upset so much when it happened because that i took the time i was just taking everything in stride and everything you know gomzila provided everything will be okay because i was in the baby was still in the hospital mhm and i and i you know i was still recovering from uh well you know what <unk> are you know i'm working <unk> going no i heard you it was a terrible thingy rained delay i'm i'm working on my own some private project mhm um which i enjoy but it's not and not [noise] i don't think i have the mines that to be i'm independent i think i need to be an employee mhm i think it's more it's more suitable to my personality into it's my my personality professional sports not professionally as well as financially mhm i just think the way i manage money the way we manage money it's just better you like getting that paycheck once a week and not just <unk> just for the end of a project or something right and <unk> and i don't i enjoy the flexibility of working at home and working when i want things like that but i don't enjoy the pressure of it like you can it's always thinking about your head right with <unk> <unk> and i have no problem you know ignoring the laundry right and ignoring the kids and working i just i just don't <unk> it's just not it's just not suitable to me i did i do it i did it for a while and i hated it also i absolutely that was one of my kids they think <unk> absolutely hated it because it like that would be in the middle of like change your kid's diaper and the phone would ring and it would be a business thing your clients yeah right and you're like you have to try to act mature your kids are screaming and the other room and you like have to pretend that nothing's <unk> you know and you really want to be in the other room settling what's going on but you have to drop everything whenever you never know it's like the bomb waiting to go off always but you can't <unk> i'd rather not the room i'd rather just be on the phone with a client right you know you also to never relax 'cause as soon as you sit down to read a book or do anything you're thinking well i really could should be doing this or you know whatever i don't have that problem 'cause i don't have the study i don't have a steady flow of work either <unk> <unk> it comes and goes and it's not i don't have that many i don't have that many things and i have to wait for people to refer 'em and i have to go get them and i don't and i and i and as much as as many times i go over every decision that i made along the way <unk> even though the last three years and every decision was the right decision at the right time and it wasn't anything i did you know what i mean we had this great master plan a few years ago that i when i was <unk> i when i was working at the consulting company and doing freelance projects <unk> at night mhm and going a little crazy 'cause i really didn't have the <unk> with three kids at home and commuting <unk> three hours a day really was hard but i didn't want to give it up because it wasn't so much money it was i was i was trying to see if this was something i could really do mhm if i liked it and if i was good at it right and then and when we wanted to have another baby mhm and and we figured out you know and phil wanted to work more he wanted to invest more in his um in in in his career right so we figured our plan are very you know all the best laid plans right <unk> <unk> and the truth is our plans came better than they could've they would have in our plan was that we wanted to have another baby and then i would have a a um what's it called um maternity leave that i would take an extended one because i had been at this job for a while right and then and that's what i would try to freelance little bit and see <unk> <unk> feel my oats and this but i would have a job waiting for me if i didn't like it mhm and so people investing his career because i'd be home with oh it'd be home more mhm in the end though i mean those things <unk> happen and they didn't happen as quickly as they used to have an unreal all those all those things together and then someone offered me while i was freelancing offered me to join them <unk> and that's what i did and <unk> and less fall right and of course right after that i became pregnant with <unk> mhm and the rest of history but what happened was in that year that i worked there mhm gave up my old job i developed <unk> i've never been <unk> fun nice portfolio right which i probably i could not have accomplished that and <unk> and i'm eternity leave right because i got really good projects and it was a a wide variety of <unk> and i have something to show now right so i'm the one hand we accomplished our goals and phil really invest in this during that time that i worked i was working two <unk> two days a week from home and two days a week from my office in tel aviv and i really was home <unk> started to teach and he started he was working three jobs and and much happier and so everyone got every one really good accomplished their goal the only problem was after the baby was born and well and then all the <unk> gone that happened before right <unk> i didn't have a safe as a safe a job so to speak to come home to mhm so what are your options now what kind of jobs are are available to you well i've been to i went through a long interview process for two job jobs right as a marketing communications writer and i didn't get either one <unk> one <unk> one has been hired anybody yet <unk> they want to get someone who what happens in with his high tech companies is there's a big learning curve to learn the technology and stuff and they want to try to find someone who's been writing in this pool in this area right they don't think it exists but they're still looking for 'cause meanwhile they're using someone who left them as a

<unk> tell you i'm not the only one that's like this well i know you are <unk> are there are other mothers that are home with your home no not really i think that's part of the problem though for you personally too i mean if you're the only one home <unk> <unk> it really is boy there's no adult to talk to well people work you know his teacher is a lot of teachers work here and like my neighbor they you know they say she works in the morning <unk> her family you know the the the <unk> practice <unk> some people <unk> busy and i just wasn't busy right what did they started auto till i would be doing something else <unk> being planned i'm not taking a full maternity leave in even getting back to work i wanted to work when i was in the hospital <unk> was like everything <unk> not everything to me but it was important to me but obviously not important enough to to like crazy employer well you'll <unk> i'm sure you'll find something i really <unk> <unk> <unk> it's like it was bound to happen it would have happened then it would have happened later would've whatever <unk> <unk> it's just really bad to have been i think i was like knocked over when i was down and they don't there's no opening their for you know they filled your place not no not at all they didn't not like a big company it was is you know two women mhm <unk> working together for fifteen years and it's a like a private you know it's uh let's see what i'm doing at home but they do it a little bit more you know it was two of them they never had a secretary mhm those but they had an office right and um when she asked me to join them was the first time <unk> she was the first time in her career that they were going to expand because until then it was basically a living for her and so the person and um so why didn't you ought to do so why don't they want you <unk> well in september when i went to the hospital figure a third of the office just vanished right so they had to reorganize and they just once and they're older and they're sitting there are ways <unk> once they just reorganize back the way it was it was just easier to keep on going that way and they scaled back a little bit and they just wanted to go back to running the business the way they always did she had these expansion plans she was she was sort of [noise] i knew it partially but i didn't know what the ramifications or be she was going through like a second awakening effort <unk> after our divorce mhm and she'd never needed to advertise she had enough business strictly for for all <unk> just wanted to see what would happen if she actually went out and marketed herself she they'd never needed to do that great and the problem to do it with you need more people <unk> <unk> or use more freelancers and she just so it wasn't as profitable it was as she thought it would be although it wasn't supposed to be i mean we agreed that i wish you wouldn't make any money on me for at least six months or so because i'd be learning right and that was a known but after that six months and still <unk> still wasn't profitable inlaws and she was starting to get scared and financially in trouble she not only does she hire me and especially also upgraded i mean she had to i._b._m. original p._c.s mhm i mean no one <unk> those anymore <unk> you know she bought <unk> thirty thousand dollars in computer equipment and expanded the office all came together right and well i think it'll all be for good because like you said you got the experience that you wouldn't have gotten elsewhere and now you just have to wait for the wait for the right thing to come along yeah look when it happened itself i mean god is still in the hospital and i also said it's you know i need a i needed a time to recover from what happened <unk> because it's <unk> took awhile mhm i mean that's i sold dream about his birth <unk> less frequently but i still do mhm there was still very we was with me for a really long time [noise] none of that

relying on her for work that's nuts you know and then i started to to redo my resume but i was only doing it to put up feelers and i got responses i got invited for interviews mhm but it just didn't come out anything and that already has started <unk> <unk> what am i can't rely on this and this i'm really now i really want the jobs you know there's <unk> there's a change in my own mindset well

<unk> <unk> oh this is this is horrendous oh the richest country on earth and we don't have money to take care of the mentally ill come on i'll tell you something this is it's an abomination i can't i just can't even talk about <unk> going to happen on the street mhm and then they'll pick them up and put 'em into jail and then and then <unk> expense and then they're totally did deteriorating car and they should have views in jail what <unk> yeah but i think maybe this is the scare of maybe they'll get gather some money together because this is how can you do this because what else <unk> wants to be precedent so the way you become precedent on the republican ticket is to uh do away with human services it's a waste of money who cares about those people <unk> well we don't care about the people as long as we save money mhm you got all that matters well the taxpayers money of course the <unk> not here's the <unk> yeah [noise] well i you know i i just once i start on this subject i don't think i can and i can go on and on you see <unk> with the los angeles unified school district what goes on there <unk> it is you know she comes home every day with such stories i said [noise] you know it's a good thing that i taught sixty years ago <unk> you know what i mean because i could never take this is she in a classroom her classroom she teaches in the classroom english as a second language yeah that's what i and what she <unk> she is mostly the latino kids these from um mexico and send that all the door you know that area <unk> she loves to teach them there's no problem there <unk> but the big problem is that the <unk> they never can give her five questions of that they gave her for classes and then they give her one class of black kids well that murders the day for her they don't want to learn <unk> and they carry on and they mimic her <unk> and they tell her she doesn't know how to speak and they speak what it's called the black english <unk> i don't i don't have to tell you what that amounts to you what <unk> whenever she prepares the lessons are not about to do it and she is very meticulous i'll tell you she is a teacher that is one in the baby and not in a million she'd do votes day and night into that work and then she prepares all this they don't do anything and the way to get there at ten to them and you see and then you never know when they'll carry a knife or a gun it is it is it is absolutely dangerous whenever she leaves in the morning i pray that she comes home safe way it's a fact every morning when she leaves i'm just worried way she leaves every morning yeah but the the other kids she loves because they they pay attention she says these kids are <unk> mhm although they come from <unk> also poverty stricken and so on and so on you know they serve breakfast and lunch in the schools now mhm [noise] so uh anyway she squeezes in this writing a book mhm and this first book has been really a tremendous success oh great a tremendous success in fact she's also been in um israel just a couple of weeks ago for one <unk> the <unk> the israeli teachers' association method in jerusalem <unk> and there she again presented her book the show they see you they feel very confident there's going to be a very big order <unk> she has spoken already a she two years ago we were in israel and at that time she had already talked to a number of <unk> of the supervisors and now she had a chance to really see the uh not only the supervisors but a number of the classroom teachers <unk> so that they are the ones who have to like the book and then it'll be ordered so it's been quite a process she had to go through the ministry of education in jerusalem and you know it's not only in english right is of course it's an english english for <unk> you know a second language too so uh was a process to get the ministry to accept that <unk> they finally did and that you see this takes so much work and here she's teaching so she never their nights that she never goes to bed [laughter] and this is what worries me night after night to be up without sleeping mhm and eating well the she eats because i'm here to cook and i put it in front of her so she can eat and run back join the book <unk> so now she's working on books to the second book which is a easier book it's what it is is based on stories that she gathers a from the whole world and the first book i believe had a teen stories let me get that and i tell you exactly what it is i have a folder just one minute mhm it's um a world full details it's a multicultural for literature so she gathers these stories many of them are written thirty forty years ago <unk> but if they had been written letters say within the last twenty years they have to pay to get permission to write to you know to use it right what it is is is an anthology mhm so uh uh for she tries to gather from various countries that are representative of the countries these kids come from <unk> so it is it's a very hard task <unk> she's forever in the library she went to the library and <unk> they use <unk> in washington the congress mhm and um i mean not tell you and then after it has written up she <unk> she has to come from the with the publisher the <unk> and the editor and it's on and on and on forever so in the house when you come to us you will see a couple of of computers <unk> the a printer most see a fax machine <unk> it's a whole factory here yeah yeah it's like [laughter] so anyway this is the big excitement now her book already has been taken to china and to a european countries and to um i think she told me that yes they took copies of the two japan mhm and um what they're trying what she's trying to do now is uh through friends you see she goes to so many conventions which you meet these people who are involved in all this writing sure sure she's made connection with the woman who teaches at columbia university and also heads the textbook vying for new york city mhm so she's working on that you see you so right now she's been getting quite a bit of money but it takes years for this to develop where he's really see the profit commander sure so that's the big excitement every time a letter <unk> excitement for <unk> while they accept the bulk unhappy accepted the book and it goes on and on now she's <unk> she's going to be at a conference in i'm in buffalo mhm uh in october she wants me to go with their but this is another story and i'll tell you what happened is i told you i was sick all year yeah so anyway she was <unk> she was at this conference our children jerusalem and then she's been in a at a conference in atlanta georgia <unk> she was at a conference in quebec this can go on and on and on i can tell you she's like a travelling salesman yeah how's she did that <unk> teach what happens you you see they get ten days a year <unk> ah which they can use <unk> supposed to be sick leave uh-huh so she's not only use it a ten days but usually it runs over and uh she uses other days <unk> <unk> so um she feels it's worth <unk> although she may not get paid for that day but <unk> it's her book it's become it started you'll see how does it start she got a second masters in um e._s._l. you see she had a bachelors or masters from wayne uh wayne state in english mhm and of course it was a regular american english and you teach literature and so on but this is not applicable anymore when you have all the minorities and so she went ahead and got another masters from cal state in english as a second language and yeah and basically she had the same experience in israel when she was teaching the kids uh who <unk> who are hebrew speaker's english so she's had twenty years of experience there <unk> although it was not to let us say on the internet and official basis as having a degree <unk> the experience <unk> was very valuable and now with the degree she is really an authority and there aren't too many people even here with minorities who have the degree as e._s._l. english as a second well yeah yeah so her contact <unk> very very extensive and uh she loves it and what happened was she had written when she got her degree she had to write a paper <unk> and she went ahead and wrote a paper route folk tales and at that time the professor said to her just so good you should have it publish <unk> that brought the idea to publish the thing <unk> and so from that simple idea it became a big project day she loves it she wishes she could stop the teaching and you don't do the writing yeah but at this point <unk> the teaching is is more lucrative <unk> writing or so she's hoping for the day she says if i get a couple of books going maybe i can afford to not teaching which is hard with the preparation i'd have <unk> tell you the whole business yeah so that's about it how <unk> how are the boys well this is interesting ah the younger boy you know finished u._c._l._a. in electrical engineering and computers and he himself a job he he complained los angeles was too small for him so he got a job in new york city oh my god wall street <unk> last <unk> as a kid of twenty one goes to wall street and gets a job with one of these now not on wall street as we think of it you know ah with all that goes on but a yeah what they call a trader eight <unk> the one who has big sums of money from friends from it all areas mhm it's in the heavy heavy millions and they <unk> <unk> what they do is they watched the markets by computer of course mhm and they know where to invest this goes in hundreds <unk> this <unk> <unk> yeah millions hundreds of millions where they watch the computer to no one to buy one for so mhm and so they took him in eat had some experience you know as a kid working here mhm but they took him man and he is now the top man in the computer business and they watch and hundreds of millions everyday mhm so he's at work seven in the morning and many times works until six at night and he got himself and apartments in i'm in a great neck what happened was that the new jersey right no it's new york call <unk> new york okay what happened was the reason he went there also is through chance he had met a kid's a boy who lived in great neck and convinced him to go to new york otherwise stayed here sure and the excitement of new york <unk> tell you <unk> he's a kid who can tea he's got <unk> the mind is brilliant is should look to have him run the business in hundreds of millions of dollars that snow <unk> play and they all <unk> like that just brought the bank of england down right [noise] i don't know [laughter] i remember i remember the story very well but you see he works the computer in the sense that he is not totally responsible <unk> because the bosses sitting there and what he directs them and tell them what's happening <unk> see he's easiest gamble well but you see this guy is willing to gamble his money sure so <unk> <unk> <unk> he went to israel a couple of weeks ago mhm and he was there and every day he'd called in to new york and talk with them to direct them what to do mhm so he was sitting in israel and telling them what to do they can wait they couldn't wait for him to return they were that exciting <unk> so he is there but his heart is very much with israel his friends are israelis uh-huh and um he loves the excitement and <unk> the <unk> and <unk> uh israel has <unk> <unk>

gimmick and i looked at me this enjoys away and it's a university of pennsylvania has it um apparently a pretty sophisticated linguistic i'm department anyway they're doing this research and so i thought now can i talk to speak seem [laughter] us and it's really interesting alison isn't thailand now but i don't know how to get reliever they just you know she's still with <unk> yeah <unk> yeah yeah well he's kind of the campuses i think to make moves all the time you know wow alison i think might stay in one spot even though that wasn't <unk> grew up but yeah they um they left to life thirtieth uh-huh they went to bangkok and there'll be i think they signed like a two year <unk> track but they get one free trip home in the summer which is really a good benefits because it's very yeah sure so and they still have just one daughter yes and i think that's probably all 'cause um i think carl feels like people like me overpopulate world [laughter] i have three friends now really yeah god and all boys <unk> yes <unk> my [laughter] oh that's so interesting and you know just <unk> german and sophie are taking swimming classes with winston <unk> and i was yeah and i was thinking about the um for your address and i thought no he's so forgetful he'll never remember it's not worth it [laughter] he'd never would or he he he wouldn't know how to you know he wouldn't know how to get it i i use really him well just just wednesday night <unk> you know <unk> every once in awhile but they're nice like i think she's the oldest of all the of all the kids the one who's i don't know if you know much about the family but the one whose father got killed in nicaragua fighting but anyway um she was living in the house and she's kind of i dunno i i don't know if she would have been this way she hasn't had all the problems <unk> life but she's kind of a goofball and she ran up such big bills that i don't think they've had a phone for a whole year because while him off but and i don't know she's not living there now but i can give you my address yeah i'd love <unk> yeah i'm <unk> <unk> you know how i have your number i i was wondering [laughter] have you talked to do and you know <unk> well i did talk to a junior but she didn't give well actually she wasn't there that day i called i talked to rough but um [noise] the last time i was in her <unk> which is nearing two years it's gonna be two years in january um i saw your husband als as of leaving the airport and i had my billfold out and he wrote it on my bill for the you know what i don't have a lot of things but i still have that [laughter] oh my gosh well i don't remember it so uh and i don't remember him telling me that he saw you know he probably spaced that he was i think he was in the middle of some kind of work project or something they picking up people from peace corps probably are that yeah but huh that was right out i mean that's a long time ago that was right after the um the change of the government and we were down because of that oh anyway so three boys bar yeah wow my hands and yeah i remember you said last time that the doctor said that you had to have a baby because of your ovaries or whatever just to keep everything in order well you know they should do it you know and so that's what it was pushed me he said that we don't want you to have a baby if it's gonna create problems but if you want to have when this is the time and it actually did turn everything around for me i don't know if it works that way for everybody but those hormones kinda took care of the problems i was having i was starting to have the problem again before like it's only maybe three months afterwards i got pregnant but i could already feel the pains and all that so why i felt so good when i was pregnant i just don't like it was a miracle and they really oh yeah and then breast feeding those hormones also help so i feel just fine i hope i hope i never have to deal with endometriosis again but you know <unk> after three <unk> so you're first boy is joel or no no no no no and he's not a and a half that's how long ago that was eleven and uh we haven't seen each other's yeah in a long time because on your other two boys um thomas is three uh-huh per month <unk> <unk> and then i have a baby who's just going to turn ten months and what's the baby's name that's logan andres huh oh how nice and you know you're gonna keep going or [laughter] well i i i thought i was done really after thomas not that i think too is the perfect number but i didn't expect to get pregnant that third time i it just kinda that happened when i was in her <unk> [laughter] that was really so i was so angry <unk> that i just knew there was no way i could ever think i'm going to bed with <unk> so [laughter] whatever [laughter] but i love my little baby yeah yeah and you're still with oscar right that's well we're still married but he's doing his own thing like usual so i've pretty much take care of the crew all along he calls to see how they're doing and pops and every once in a while but it's tough it really is and wow daughter lives here too she does well she has since well i think they've been here five years now five years this summer 'cause we were figuring that they could apply for citizenship both <unk> leah i'm he's <unk> and she just turned eighteen now he doesn't live here um he had caught up well it's a long long story but um at one point when i got real irritated with oscar everybody in the family insisted that i was an idiot and i said they can't take care of these children which you know i really believe they're like any i mean it does make a lot of intellectual sense i guess but <unk> you really i didn't want to do that the kids that i did and so i sent them to stay with him and then i felt bad about it immediately and then he wouldn't let them come back and so it turned into a situation where lehia was really the one that wanted to come back <unk> junior got um decided that living with his father with what he wanted and his mom used to bake him to let her come back and he'd say yes they hang up the only thing i never let you back there [laughter] so it was real time but it wasn't really that he wanted her around but it was just <unk> i don't know people do stupid things so so they're living with him no i'm now <unk> probably two years ago then we seen i worked it out where i got power of attorney from her mom 'cause their mom always had custody and she called me one day when there was nobody in the house but her and i drove and god and kind of still that would <unk> right [laughter] [laughter] oh my god believe that i'd ever do that but <unk> was very exciting actually because [laughter] i mean i had to drive like two and a half hours so we you know you didn't know it any more but somebody might be coming home i said redeye called her when i got to the corner you know <unk> was really something and we just packed the car pool i mean there wasn't one into space left and then we just flew out of there we went to the nearest mcdonalds to kinda repack where we could breathe [laughter] homework <unk> and then you know he never said anything about it you know he i know that he knew she was better off here and she had told me that she almost committed suicide once but you know he doesn't even know anybody <unk> isn't that <unk> doesn't care <unk> kids but he's not really capable of the father you know huh so what's he doing and she's studying or did she already graduated high school she's going to be in her last year of high uh-huh and she's been with your mom for two months so she'll be coming back tomorrow um uh so it's that's that's what we have here and then oscar junior has the last year he was he graduated one year ago from high school and he started going to school in missouri and then just out of the blue he told me that he and his buddy wanted to move back to school here which is really surprising and <unk> he was kind of same that living with his father wasn't what he you know kind of had his opinion on it has had changed but they wanna tune apartment they didn't want to burden me anymore were his words but you know i know that they were they were i'm pretty her which is great they're twenty you know so yeah moved in about four blocks mm maybe for either about a mile from us they love wow and that's gonna be really help is going to be nice his buddy <unk> he's finishing some work that he was doing and then he's coming up something next week but that that's kind of an and nuts [laughter] wow things that have been going on and i know it's interesting are you working or are you teaching as well i don't yeah i'm i let's see when i came back i i taught adult basic education because <unk> was really hard to get a job at home and it's probably still that way and i went for my masters and counselling yeah uh-huh um actually i was asked to come back and be counselor at the american school and that was the year i was pregnant with no and i was really torn i didn't know what to do but my doctor didn't want me to go back to hunters because i'd been so sick before he felt that <unk> i really needed we didn't know how the pregnancy was going to go but i i feel like i really i mean i wasn't really paying that much attention to what he said did that did it for a little bit so i didn't know and uh let's see what would i guess i was working part time that you're doing part time counseling jobs and then the next year i had to have one offer that i had to take the other one was waiting for principal to come back um but i ended up i wanted to go into high school counseling but i couldn't because the principal was out on this boat they told me and he had to make the decision it's like i need this need to know fast because i'm pregnant and i cannot you know risk losing your job so and that <unk> community college which wasn't what i wanted at the time but <unk> as it turned out it probably was the best um and i like it real well i i was like <unk> for about five years and now i'm <unk> i'm not great but a couple of years after i started there than the high school that's where <unk> goes offered me a job again because i knew people there but that was another hearing kind of thinks is exactly what i would have wanted to use earlier but just the timing was kinda bad i felt like i'd be really um creating some professional bad feelings had i had i left at that point so i see where it was and i do a lot of interesting things i probably would've gotten a little burned out by the gang situations <unk> high school so this is probably better because the game <unk> nice administration the ministry of job in a community college that sounds like a good show you know what it is you know you can lose your job at any moment when you're <unk> [laughter] but i mean you can <unk> the faculty and <unk> are the union dislike can have <unk> [laughter] wow really oh yes and they get you know you just have a lot more power but i knew that when i left that will i i i knew if that was going to do it i was going to do i need to change in fact we have um they've been developing a project with <unk> which is nice <unk> i'm not quite there <unk> sunday are get down to believe but for me it almost might be worth to go because i know that if i'm there i'm going to want to get on the airplane go over there and <unk> i'm not going to care about what's going on and police yeah just an excuse to get that [laughter] they all know that <unk> because she can't keep your mind that <unk> that goes <unk> i'll bet you'd be able to put it all in proportion in perspective well there you know and and <unk> and just pay for <unk> use some of your vacation time or whatever and take a trip over you know i'd have to probably do that yeah now jackie told me that you're the principal is it alcohol yeah principal of elvo and <unk> elementary school do you like it yeah wow yeah well it's it's it's a lot of work it's a lot of work a lot of responsibility and i'm still it's been five years now and so i think i've i've been proved a little bit over the past five years but i don't i don't know if i'm cut out to be a principal i'm doing it and i think i'm doing a fairly good job but i don't know i i i don't like it a lot it's not something i would like to do for another five years [laughter] uh-huh but i'll have to see what i can go into next because i don't know if i want to i'm getting kind of tired of teaching actually so we'll see too many options not too many yeah not too many get out of teaching altogether maybe go work for an i._d. or someplace yeah someplace <unk> got a masters degree in education [noise] uh-huh but with <unk> the university of alabama uh-huh they were <unk> they gave us a program and so i did manage to get that but with a degree in education and experience in schools i don't know what else i could do yeah well and i know the pay situations always yeah <unk> you know if you go into the regular economy that would make it hard plus the security of it does it yeah it's it's getting pretty insecure down here pretty the more than ever [laughter] that's what they're getting pretty yeah but you know i went back to new jersey just this past couple of months ago and i don't know i don't know if i would want to go back there to live <unk> i don't think i would want to go to new jersey um i don't know i i still like the schools for the kids you know the school down here i think it's an excellent school and and you really taking chances when you go to the states you know and put them in a public school <unk> a lot of good ones a lot better terrible no i agree well i think the society has yeah it's better <unk> i do i mean uh yeah there are a lot of advantages living here but still <unk> also it's getting to be a really dangerous place i mean you can't go to a lot of the public parks that you could even go to a few years ago really you know <unk> and <unk> they're dangerous places now uh yeah i know that <unk> his mom acts like <unk> the most dangerous place and the whole world she doesn't live there you know what i think well let me get some perspective is it because she doesn't live there anymore or is it really that way it's so hard when you're not you know [noise] well i think i think it is a bit more dangerous i mean you guys when you lived in the kennedy you'd have to you know really make sure things are under locking key now and you know windows closed and you know and walking downtown walking on the streets you just you just have to be a little more careful i mean you don't live in total paranoia yet but but it is a little more dangerous or you know the level of poverty i think it's gotten worse and <unk> they're they're more thieves yeah and how old are your girls now jasmine ten and sophie is six and a half <unk> seven october wow and older november right <unk> yeah <unk> he's just the <unk> the time <unk> did i uh-huh thomas is never want to go to sleep at nights we sitting on my lap now i have such a hard time getting an opportunity <unk> you because i wanted <unk> not to be a rotten our there plus where i could do it with <unk> pig interrupt you know yeah <unk> i gotta do tonight so it it it was lucky we were in we just got home about an hour ago oh we went to tailor good timing oh wow now does your school started we started uh two weeks from now last week of august so are you going <unk> already yeah i'm going to start going into morrow yeah i

but he's he is and so he's not working with them anymore now he's working with the japanese or a group of japanese people that are working with the ministry of health or the project to better health in general hearing hunter so he's working with them but he's still got the lawsuit going yeah that's quite something to take on that i'm yeah per se [laughter] exac well it's not the score it's it's <unk> feed the company that was that <unk> contracted yeah but the score but um yeah we'll see we'll see how that goes [laughter] yeah it's been in court for a while actually and they haven't they haven't gotten into it yet <unk> let me give you my address before our time okay they'll tell us when it's time <unk> okay <unk> i don't want to do this and then find out we [laughter] we've <unk>

doesn't cost them nothing 'cause the way it's set up in the states anyways once you pay your feet and you can use it a million times are one time that costs the same thing but how 'bout outside of the country i thought i heard it costs like like similar to a to an out of country call no well i i i think it depends on whoever gets a hold of it and sells it oh whatever yeah [laughter] that's that makes it and and believe there's <unk> <unk> they have it there it's like that it's got to get the <unk> and they're much less developed but um i guess it's just maybe the the physical <unk> being physically closer who knows if some monopolies preventing it [laughter] you know but yeah there was somebody who's in control and believes and they do cause it to cost money to the other entities uh-huh mhm i hope it is now but they're working on that now so that shouldn't that should be ready to go in the not too distant future well if you get an email address just fax me what you have enough to low notices every once in a while [laughter] 'cause then case it's it's just so much easier than writing <unk> mhm mhm and it gets people fast <unk> well it's so nice hearing from you [laughter] now tell me is your family well you said you were in new jersey yeah my mother was sick my mother had a had a tumor oh one of lobes of her lung and she had that whole <unk> removed and she's supposedly didn't need any chemotherapy or any other kind of you know a radiation or anything um the doctor said he got the whole thing so we'll see we'll see if she hope so if she doesn't get it again but and my brother's living with my mother and my sisters living out in california she's got two kids did <unk> i don't know if you probably didn't know a few years ago i had a a nephew with a brain tumor know so and he died he died when he was five years old he got it when he was like well they detected it when he was like two and a half years old <unk> oh yeah my my youngest brother is oldest boy he's got he's got two more boys <unk> yeah that was pretty devastating i've <unk> i had a cousin who had brain cancer he lived to be sixteen and that was many many years ago but you know that you carry that legacy for a long time because you know talk about it like you <unk> you know <unk> that's how my sister in law is yeah she's talking about this about about the little boy all the time and it's only been years since he died maybe that's part of it yeah i'm sure but um she's doing all kinds of volunteer work with different cancer organizations and getting involved and and you know with all of those people still that's just so terrible yeah you being far away i know yeah and at the time i couldn't really afford to go home well actually i could have gone home but then you know it was would have been a heck of a long ride for somebody to come get me and take me out to where they live in pennsylvania and so i didn't go but they have their hands full now yeah yeah i'm sure my father died um oh i don't know so it was maybe five or six years after i moved back here and i remember thinking oh i would have been had i not him home it it really any different situation you know yeah i think you told us that last time he came down your father had just recently died right <unk> <unk> the year before you <unk> you know one <unk> something <unk> he had died like couple of months after one of my er before one of my trips 'cause i remember alison writing i can't believe he went to her <unk> christmas and i'm so [laughter] i guess i was so cold emotion why is that didn't even think what you know that that was an odd thing to do but my friend went over <unk> stayed with my mother but she has other children here you know i just didn't think that would make that much difference yeah you've always been travelling around anyway yeah that's how i mean i felt like we've been here i just can't <unk> stay around that was better for me i'll tell you that i think i wanted to go through 'cause you're see her suffering so but how was your mom oh she's pretty good she's seventy years old now i'm wow really she's a young seventy she looks young you know but i try to keep in my mind that at any time they could really go ride she's i think he you know she was diabetic and she really had problems with that this last year but on the outside most people wouldn't know because she's still maintain big yard and everything and and looks good but she <unk> fact we don't know unless you tell them that really um i think things are kinda just wear it out probably they can't really keep her completely control but i guess the doctors that worried but i suppose if you're just was seventy years old this is the way it goes but to her she sees she reads and studies and it's like i don't want to be on that one [laughter] you know so that keeps her young yeah well maybe i know she worried a lot about it 'cause it's kinda like watching your body and i guess i would say i don't know but she <unk> yourself with insulin and everything yeah she's that had always and i think she does it about four times a day now but she takes <unk> they were trying to find the right the right i'm right level yeah the right kind because of that a lot of stuff does she ended up changing dodgers uh went to a really well known specialist that my brother also see because he's off a diabetic and he i asked her we're kind of pleaded with her to go to a new series of education workshops and she kind of felt like sydney too but he they guaranteed heard that a lot of things have changed over the fifteen years or so since she become diabetic and she <unk> she went like six days i think all day long and she was real happy that she did i think basically it just made her feel a little bit more comfortable that what was going on wasn't anything she can worry about she just had to deal with it and some of the dietary stuff had changed they were allowing the the things that they were in the past and that was nice but still no substitute for the for the injectable insulin no pills know she's she's she's considered brittle i don't know if that's the only reason but she's never been able to do pills they hadn't talked to her about having um some sort of an implant mhm the end <unk> see this was a few years ago that they talked about that she just she told me that she feels that that's for a younger person was <unk> really didn't want to mess with it and i can respect that 'cause i know that things don't always go perfectly with those kind of things that <unk> her doctor i guess was thinking that because it supposedly performs on call or something like that that it might work better for <unk> and she's so brutal but <unk> interestingly i've found out that one of the guys i work with is diabetic and he's probably about oh maybe thirty eight i don't know he's maybe he's early forties but he's not elderly any by any means and he had one of those and he said he made him take it out because he just he was it wasn't the cure for him i think he says sometimes it would react when it shouldn't oh god all those a lot easier to use <unk> that's where he's at so i was glad to hear that she didn't do it after he told me that that that was a nightmare for him and he's a teacher i can imagine you know <unk> more prevalent happened in in having your insulin pump pumping when you don't need to yeah so vice versa technology doesn't always work [laughter] and none of your kids came out <unk> had our diabetic well my kids are not yet <unk> of course my brother became diabetic when he was about twenty five my mother was i think fifty she became diabetic so fifteen fifty fifty <unk> zero really kind of have to <unk> to see how things go we like one of my children this little guys fall asleep on the love sugar the all the really the baby didn't really care because he hasn't been around a bit thomas i think if you get three pop <unk> cookies and candy that's one <unk> real better about living here because i know if we lived in the first <unk> here for two <unk> yeah that's that's my impression when we go to that i mean it's just an open world the pop pop [laughter] yup and i remember that when i was just home in my brother's house they <unk> well there's so many different kinds of juice that you can buy in a supermarket and and and good price you know here you can't you have to either make it which takes time or or the pop and that's easier yeah yeah so but it's also nice hearing from you [laughter] well it's i i'm glad that i read the cause i thought well i i don't know <unk> think this is really goofy but it's nice that you know i'm glad you did because i've i've been <unk> i've been thinking all this past week i think you know what <unk> thought know he'd never bring it you know he he always comes later class sometimes she doesn't

they're doing starting construction across the street again so they came through with the big earth mover which on earth huge amounts of stone so it's just i can't even our back the carpets closest i can get and then i when i started lugging out i took my [noise] my wheelbarrow but it was broken unfortunately and so uh i still got all i could walk without have even go anywhere the wheelbarrow 'cause there's so many stole how neat just dug up huge it's just the most incredible rocky soil over there so we'll serve then are you are you going to like <unk> little stuffed between the stone

out my ah we'd walker recorded i bet you've forgotten it by now huh what i've forgotten by now that we're being recorded well well i was just listening to you talk and i was thinking <unk> work here

have your door and by now oh god yes i've got my daughter my fenced yard and lots <unk> comes in and out and run up and down the stairs and raises outside again today he had a visiting dog that ah came over to foot <unk> nice pretty dog uh one of those blue picked you know sliver spotted type dogs big dogs <unk> kind of go left home and <unk> was wondering the streets and so we took him in and called his owner and watching played with him for a long time and had a really good time so [noise] and i almost felt i felt bad when i send them back home because they said well he gets he's tied up

have a stupid then outside <unk> stone justice stone yeah i windy and and and they part you have to have a three foot stoop well not for this you don't because it's it's you don't have to have anything you can just step outside but it's i went and got a um [noise] i picked i went to a stone korea picked out a stone mhm and had <unk> great big stone delivered and then they also delivered to stones that they put down in the river so i can go down and stand <unk> it's really nice having a little <unk> 'cause it used to be i'd go down and it's being mocking <unk> going i stand on my beautiful stone [laughter] that sounds really nice yeah it's nice yeah so have you been doing [noise] well i've just been working but i'm planning my next vacation which is i'm going in september to japan <unk> don't know <unk> girl well no actually i'm going into debt to do it but i decided you know i've been telling my students <unk> lived here two years ago and she's the one that really said come and stay with me and then this other girl that i had a as a student ten years ago still keeps in touch and she called me and said when are you coming and i thought if i don't go they're going to stop asking me and that way you know and this way at least it you know i can go and have a place to stay part of the time anyway but i'm going on a courier flight too you know where um you carry somebody else's luggage or something [laughter] somebody drugs carry anything illegal or if you're bored you don't discuss it now <unk> really well it's really like being a fight you should see these instructions i have you know it's just like you have to get to the airport and look for a guy in a blue jacket with a certain kind of and save me on it and he will give you papers and take you to the luggage place in check you and and then the luggage will go and then you have one carry on peace that you get to take and then and then when you get to japan you have to deliver the papers to a guy that's at a certain location and the immigration area and then he will take <unk> are you kidding i think you're carrying probably i'm carrying boxes of stuff or i might be carrying suitcases i don't i don't well what kinda things <unk> well i don't know maybe documents er industrial stuff <unk> i have no idea but it's all it's i mean it's all legal they guarantee it's legal and there's a guy there that gives you the papers and takes a paper so it's not like you go through and the customs people say well <unk> and the pay per se what's in the stuff you know but there's a guy there that to explain it so supposedly it's gotta be illegal stuff and then when you come back you call you call <unk> name mr <unk> and you tell them that you're back in town and he'll tell you where to meet him and then you go to the airport and you meet a guy who may or may not give you things to bring back 'cause that's i'm not sure but he gives you back your tickets <unk> when you get to japan they take your return ticket and you can have it back until you come back and so um then you get back then there was a guy that <unk> me too and then leaves very bizarre but <unk> it's like a third of the cost of the round trip ticket to japan in fact it was four hundred dollars round trip right to japan so and <unk> dollar yeah jesus must be about seventeen hundred from here it's it's twelve hundred from here but it's i'm paying full of i'm paying four hundred yeah oh that's very cheap yeah but um <unk> that and then if you have a place to stay right now <unk> about eight hundred dollars a day to just walk around well and i'm going to get a train path like you know they have in europe but they have one in japan because flying as real expensive and i want to go all these places and that everybody says well you should fly there because you don't have very much time but once you know one of those trains were they shove you write a bully push you are in behind behind and pack you in one one flight in japan like i wanted to go <unk> that's where <unk> you know in the very north north part and a round trip flight from tokyo's costs more than my round trip flight to japan so i mean really the bullet train is gonna be the only way to go you know and i figure like when i go there if i stay in those japanese hotels where they have to tommy math and rice walls and stuff it's not so expensive i just got a book yesterday defined where the cheap places are <unk> [noise] so anyway i'm just going but so far i haven't been able to reach my friend in tokyo that's <unk> did you meet rico so how come you haven't been able to break out <unk> her because i don't have her phone number and i wrote her a card and she hasn't called me back or written me back but the other girl already called me back and and where <unk> you know but <unk> was kind of the key 'cause she's in tokyo and that's where i really need to have a place to put my stuff you know how long have you to go for eleven days i was gonna go for seven but then i thought you know going all that way and i may never go there again so i better take a little longer but i couldn't afford to go more than eleven because i figure even sometime i'll have to you know pay for rooms and i have to pay for food and they say that's really expensive you know yeah a cup of coffee five dollars hamburger two twenty five dollars it's five dollars so i'm gonna try and you know eat a lot of noodles and plane rise i don't like japanese food very well i don't either i wonder if they recorded that i don't like japanese [laughter] so i figure if i'll stick to rice noodles and that can't be as expensive as sushi and stuff which i don't like you know so they're like temper uh that's about it i liked him for <unk> right um but <unk> i like it cooked all very much so very very cook but did they say is just outrageous so i figure i won't eat any beef fallen there oh that's all right you know and fishes okay if it's fried so like ten <unk> fish would be okay you got to be lots <unk> [laughter] that's okay that's better that than spending lots of money and getting sick anyway right so i hear <unk> coming to visit to yes <unk> they come here we're gonna go to the venue that sounds like meet up to maine so i don't have any money when i until i get better control of my resources yeah which i figure it'll be a couple of years [noise] well that's what they say they say when you buy a house that you should stretch <unk> stretched [laughter] you know we get we were gonna get our money and what three more years for more than two <unk> two <unk> write it's only for your deal two more years right yeah <unk> i've decided with that i think i'll pay off my student loans which will take a big even though they're a low interest rate they just seem like they go on forever and i really would like to have um gone yeah right can you not go to school anymore i don't go to i know you don't have you just sort of given it up for [noise] feel well certainly give it up for now i just ah [noise] i just spend too much time in the past living for some day i'm gonna do this isn't right school for this sunday i'll do that and decided right now i'm just going to do it right now no it was to live a little more in the present and enjoy it for what it is and and besides it's just it's really <unk> it's a it's draining day to be in sure working late and to have my time to spend my weekend i just don't want to do it i i i just don't want to do it right now every now and then i think she would it be fun to take a class and such and such and then i and i get the you know <unk> next catalogue and i said oh that looks really cool and then i think i'm too tired i just don't want to do it by the time i go back and forth to work i just do so much stuff around the garden yeah yeah i just i'm like [noise] looking <unk> actually i was thinking <unk> as i was going through my we'd <unk> thought <unk> little tiny garden and she has somebody that takes care <unk> [laughter] yeah and i had this huge garden [laughter] spit all my right here and it's just the guard is just getting bigger and bigger and bigger <unk> all the time and it eventually and that was <unk> watching martha stewart today and she was walking down talking about her perennial garden three hundred foot perennial garden <unk> nurse fluffy did i thought she was working out a perennial garden but i don't think like that well i think you'd probably have a pretty find garden and maybe we should call house beautiful you know it's <unk> it's hard because i haven't really bad soil and so i basically have to just replace soil and fix it takes a long time and it's a lotta money and finally i'm getting some <unk> going but it takes a long time to get that going <unk> i cut and dried roses off my rose bushes yesterday <unk> how i'm so in the same time i watered all my indoor plants now see i'm terrible with my indoor plants yeah well i'm i am too i just wanted <unk> charlie accuses me up killing them but i mean they're still growing so i figure they're not dead minor <unk> i'm just not an indoor plant person i have some but i just don't i don't see the you know i just sort of look past them outside and go outside and then i come in at night and i look at them <unk> oh should have done something about you today but oh well tomorrow and i just forget about 'em tomorrow [noise] so i'd have to totally that helps you have 'em all in one place <unk> mine are all downstairs but they're they're just they just uh they're just not a hard time getting <unk> i just want to go outside all the time my every time i'm like well <unk> you know yeah i actually do this but no go go outside to [noise] i happen <unk> slowly but surely cleaning up my room mate decided <unk> sure i mean it's going to come i have to clean up a little and it's just been true i have this schedule of room to do they don't know how much all get done well just slowly keep today i did the past the front path up to the house i'm so proud of myself it was just <unk> feel was roxanne weeds and stuff and i sort it all the little rocks into the <unk> the big <unk> around the side and pull weeds and it looks so pretty and i planted a garden i mowed that huge big lawn and did the <unk> and [noise] i look around and it finally starting to look really nice i bet your neighbors are impressed they're probably impressed by your by your sense of duty going out there every day or impressive out there all the time they're going <unk> believe it shocks always say you know i can't believe i've lived with for different people you're only person that they're moving a yard <unk> [laughter] right but that's why look so good but i like doing it you know and i and i've got i've finally gotten used to the fence that first the fence just was so overwhelming 'cause it's a big fed how high is it it's uh six feet wow no no no is it six or is it five feet it's five feet it's five feet high <unk> <unk> it's five feet and it's all would was wire backing and it just it just over powers house but i i'm getting used to it now now to me it just looks like a little farm little farmyard which i like and next year it's gonna get roses and climate is <unk> climbing up at the national get all covered with flowers and stuff <unk> friday [noise] but right now it's still <unk> <unk> oh yeah that's nice <unk> stays in his area now he says this year he did one day last one day about two weeks ago i came home from work and there's this stuffed shoot up all over the lawn and i just thought what the hell and it was like the kind of places that <unk> would <unk> but he was sitting in the window you know looking at me from now <unk> well <unk> you know and so he came outside and he was <unk> you know i was picking up the stuff and he's kind of sneaking away and i <unk> i know you could have done it wasn't because you're in the house you notice link away and we said this guilt complex going mhm because this stuffed chewed up in the yard and so they one side of news on my answering machine there was <unk> there was a message from um rachel that said <unk> was outside today and and uh we came by and we we didn't think he should be running around because he was barking at some of the kids and so we put 'em in the yard and put them inside the fence and like couldn't figure out how he'd gotten out and i finally realized that i think i probably just left it open by mistake on the back but he just stayed in the yard all day he didn't go anywhere he did bark at some kids which is why they locked up but um now how does he go in and out he has a doggie door he has a dog door where in the new <unk> in the door i said that goes into the kitchen and he just runs in and out and well that's good and then he has his own little yard along side here who's the only art it goes along the back and along side it's you can see <unk> and then it it hooks <unk> both corners oh i saw that he can see the front door he can see the back door he can see the road he can see everything get out and go in size guy he's completely and then he can run in the house if somebody if he sees somebody he can see them from any way they approach <unk> house if they get in the house he can read right inside of bite him right [laughter] so as they break the one guy down <unk> get down so um and he likes it a lot so what that means that can't go back there because she gets trapped so because it is <unk> well she could really but she she'd have to climb the wire and right so she's decided that it's actually not place that she prefers which is fine with me yeah yeah well that's nice <unk> [noise] so what are you going to japan uh september twelfth well let's just about <unk> coming here right she's coming there the tenth i think well see i have a break from classes from the aids to the twenty ninth i mean i have to work my staff job but i'm taking off from my staff job you know i have some vacation time so i won't have teaching time in there so it's the perfect i mean it's just the the courier flights you kinda have to go when they say they have a flight you know you can't say i want to go on this day and come back on this oh you can't know they tell you like on call well no it's it's more specific than that but like i i called them i said you have anything in september and they said yes we do we have a seven day flight we have a a nine day we have an eleven day and a fourteen day what would you like and i said well how when when are they you know and they said well okay the seven day starts on the tenth comes back on the seventeenth and that's what when i was gonna do but then i decided that was too short so i called them back and said you have a a like a slight longer when they said yeah we have an eleven days starts on the twelfth comes back on the twenty first so that's what i'm doing but <unk> you have to go on their schedule but i'm going <unk> singapore airlines which everybody says it's a wonderful airline well i think you should have to go first class to protect a valuable luggage <unk> absolutely i have a new little suitcase that has one of those has wheels and the chicken put chicken put it in the overhead compartment you know it's it's a regulation smallest sides of those little suitcase <unk> and so you can take that and they can take one carry on bag but i figure i can also work <unk> lots of pockets and i can also have a big purse a giant perk it's nice to have one big i think it's <unk> nice to have yeah they're all amount of stuff even though it's hard getting down to it it's really nice once you've got it right i agree with you the only thing i'm worried about is if i go to <unk> it's gonna be cold already 'cause that's like alaska in september it's got alaska what was that far north no i think so no oh for goodness sake i thought it was that high up i don't think so then the southern part is quite warm you know it's alaska would be going <unk> northern russia well the bottom of alaska apart like that's around you know we'd i'd be more like canada yeah more like [noise] wow orange better but i still think it's cooler there than it is here you know you should watch the weather channel right now 'cause the weather channel is telling us what temperature <unk> i just happened to watch it i don't usually watch it but for some reason i was watching it the other day it was telling me what the temperature was in greece and and about the storm going across czechoslovakia and it just sort of basically told you you know what the weather was like in in it was funny to watch you know how when we when we look at storms here and well i don't know about you but <unk> when we could storms here we always watch the mid west and see it coming across ride west area <unk> right we watched the mid west and see it coming <unk> sometimes up from florida and it just seems funny that europe watched you know all the it's like it's coming over from england across friends it just seems weird to see it going across eight countries the same way here just would go cross a few state right right [noise] but anyway so they showed storm's going through and stuff <unk> and i'm sure that they have japan as well you need to get used to your weather channel's so you can tune in and see what the weather is like i don't know how to find the weather channel do you have cable yeah i do then you probably have it i think i do i just don't know where it because they haven't sent me for a long [laughter] than <unk> the numbers are so it's in the t._v. guy i mean it's you know known mine isn't isn't this sunday mind's in the sunday newspaper we'll see but <unk> every city has a different cable company right but in in the sunday newspaper at the very front there's a listing of all the towns and what <unk> doesn't years have that it only <unk> each they only prayed about five of them all that there are over twenty or so now see mine has way more than mine has about thirty lifted across the <unk> different towns and then he's got all that if they would do that it's a two page sing and all across the top are all the different <unk> different cables and then all down the <unk> the left hand side is all the different channels and then you go over and match up your town with what channels do you get so to speak to to page spread of of ah because i yeah i'm the same way they give you a little thing when you get it and then that's it right and i don't i don't have <unk> they don't do that and at least i only get the sunday right that's what ours is in the front of the t._v. week or whatever it's right in front of the t._v. week there's a little thing that shows all the cable that it's only started about two months ago they didn't used to do it i'll write to the times and tell him <unk> did that reminds me you know <unk> i'm i met this guy that knew dad <unk> <unk> it was so weird i i went to the the colony theater where i performed they needed some people to do some work for um some extra things and i said okay i'll do that so i went to this meeting and i met this man and we were just talking and he he indicated that he had been at the time he used to work at the times and and we were talking about i don't know employees support or something and i said oh my father used to work the time and he said oh how how long was he at the times i said well he was there like thirty nine years and he said i was there like thirty nine years myself <unk> but he's younger than dad you know so i said well did you happen to know dante said don't live <unk> bonn lived over on virginia and and and then we started talking and it turns out he was the guy that he ran the employee benefits for retirees like when i needed to borrow money so dad could move from the house to the condo i don't know if you knew i did that <unk> money and he's the guy that approved it and he knows ray and he really liked that and he said he visited them a few times you know and stuff that was kind of neat to know 'cause he talked about the times like the old guys talk about the times right not like the new guys talk about the time in fact he talked about the new guys in how the times was not so cool anymore but it was kind of neat you know to meet him yeah name was <unk> he he know about you know about <unk> about you know you want <unk> evil bitch <unk> knew about the evil bitch and he he i think he knew that they'd gotten divorced or he knew that they were having problems because he'd been there when she was railing against dad for some reason or other and she couldn't hide it you know so so yeah you did <unk> so anyway that was kind of interesting you knew that that had passed away and stuff like that you know so but he didn't know enough to tell us about the insurance [laughter] but you know <unk> you know you know i'm going to mention that to my probably see him this week 'cause they have another meeting and his group and i just might mention that to them you know that was a big mistake really actually if i'd known that you know might have been able to get some proof that that really had changed in some way or something that <unk> probably not no it's gone thank god thank god we don't have to deal with any of that is true this is true so i assume tom at some point collected his money yeah you never said anything anybody but like the check came back so i know he did how long did it take him to cash it well they came back and took it more than a month that was it i think the second month that had been out you know but so i don't know he finally decided <unk> to claim his <unk> his a certified meal i didn't know if he'd ever claim is certified yeah but i guess he did i guess so i haven't talked to steve i've been meaning to call them because i just wanted to you know check in with him and all so i took promised him i'd buy him a drink and actually i think he should buy me drink but i haven't [laughter] oh i have a question about taxes or something you know so but i i i guess i'll do that sometime like steve's you know yeah like these two it's a nice man serious procrastinator but a nice a matter of fact serious procrastinator one of the best <unk> yeah so how's your job oh boring but i'm getting used to the fact that i leave the boring wise i keep saying you live <unk> exciting life when you were in your twenties you moved around had lots of jobs with lots of places now you're just gonna sit here and tell you <unk> well i tell myself that too because i'm not happy in my job right now and i keep thinking well you could change it but they don't have <unk> i really have a pretty good situation in terms of flexibility [noise] so i do too and <unk> let me tell you how <unk> easy it is to change it once you reach forty five well that's right i mean i'd have to have a pretty good place to go to but no jobs are secure anymore i know that's another reason that i don't mind it quite so much interest freaky when you realize that you know <unk> dad was you know young or he could you know support a family <unk> <unk> it's like they said you could <unk> support a family on any job if you had a job it would be if you worked in a gas station forever you did if you had a job it was enough money to support yourself but now of course it's you know right job means nothing and you could be gone at any minute and there's this huge separation of of ah income that didn't used to exist <unk> you know her doctor used to be just somebody who made good money but <unk> madison <unk> doesn't value the loyalty or even competitions that much i mean i maybe it's i don't know why it is that incompetent is

yeah i'm a terrible alcoholic yeah and her union is really i think partly the <unk> the fact that she had the leniency with her union to let this happen is why it happened you know i think if she had to have a job and had to be sober to go to work she would have been yeah but she was allowed sue the leniency of this union to take all this time off and all she did with their time off was just get drunk <unk> drunken driving and i think that's true in some cases but i don't think it's true in every case but i do i i do think that because we've become more limited just too that people you know they they feel that in confidence is not a valid reason to be fired so they sue and <unk> <unk>

<unk> tamara was testing boker so this week after test and do something else and then prepare for my classes okay so you start full fledge next week okay monday monday yep sounds good well i got my raised at work did you get at this weekend my paycheck yeah oh great so it's it wasn't a big last year <unk> cats but quite that i'm what what percent uh [noise] i figured it's a bonus three per cent raise uh-huh um she figured by hourly wages to fifty cents an hour raise <unk> that's good yeah yeah it sounded good so that's good at all i don't know what <unk> how it'll sec my paycheck off to wait and see but like it's about a grand a year that's good yeah so that to bed and then um they're going to give me a bonus for a couple of different projects i did this year they're gonna give me a bonus for one of 'em and then what's the other one culture that going to give people it's for that to excellent excellent what do they have any idea what you have any idea like <unk> would be um actually yeah i um this is where this down from i think was i went to an in service <unk> all of us did <unk> family medical leave act <unk> cake <unk> you know all this legal stuff with employees you had to really be careful yeah so anyway <unk> medical leave given by our lawyer <unk> and the question i raised was well um [noise] then is it really legal to postpone and you'll evaluation because of somebody going on maternity leave which that's what happened with me and another one of my staff it asking that same question the day before <unk> she'd gone on maternity leave those wanting winter evaluation was doing i said well you know other people's phone for five weeks because you were gone for five weeks <unk> you know and she's like oh okay you know but it didn't quite sat right with me and i thought you know <unk> didn't set right with me when i when it happened to me either <unk> like i've been with a company for three years and and then you know you don't get your evaluation if you do two or three maturity leaves and <unk> you know in actuality mhm dot for an entire year work that you've done for the company mhm you know what i mean yeah well anyways you know according to family medical leave act if it's a across the board race like uh they gave the example of in attendance bonus [noise] then you can't um you can't penalize a person for being on family medical leave mhm so you have to give it to them if they're giving it to everybody else mhm she didn't say <unk> well as it boils down to it um our annual evaluations although we shouldn't postponed the date of the actual evaluation mhm the raise is based on performance and uh-huh and they generally beginning to raise the same time they do the evaluation uh-huh so which makes sense to me you know <unk> know [noise] so anyways what they what they said was that the bonuses would actually probably equal out close to the amount that i would've gotten <unk> figured out back pay for the three months that i didn't get my race for <unk> mhm so if i figure right it's about six hundred bucks so mhm six or seven something like that so i'm i'm guessing the raise will be two three hundred dollars or a bonus <unk> excellent yeah that'll be nice yeah nice little nice little perks great good i got a raise to did you hear good we came back from vacation and i haven't met her i got a really nice that's great how how much was years were spent five percent great syntax sick yeah it's great that's good yeah that would be helpful huh yeah we'll be [laughter] [noise] oh <unk> yeah yeah [noise] so anything else <unk> what did you guys are um [noise] let's see i'm not really i hear your helping <unk> a lot with decorations for her wedding um not yet not yet i don't know exactly what i'm doing oh oh but something what you being in charge of that's right <unk> forgot that yeah when the when when we decorate the church on a friday before the wedding i think i'm in charge of that okay whatever that means exactly i'm not sure well i suppose us growing up the decorations and putting them up yeah but i mean i i suspect we're all do this all help oh yeah i would think so i suppose you just want somebody to make sure that it gets done and gets done well nice and yeah you know somebody that can take care of the snake eggs right she doesn't have to worry about it she wants me to sing oh yeah mhm do you want to yeah actually i think so i have a difficult time but i think i'd like to and she wants round assure great so yeah around and dennis i guess are going <unk> good you have to get a toxin i don't think so i think they're just gonna wear a suit uh-huh good runs like oh good that i get a new suit [noise] good but <unk> <unk> your wedding i think it's still really nice yeah so we'll see maybe <unk> he won't look what happened to get a new address definitely nice chance and if you get this bonus then you'll have the money that's right that's right so anyway that will be nice and then she's well she was telling me that um michael's can be ring <unk> oh yeah yeah [laughter] and that ryan was was wondering what he got to do and he was saying something about if you could carry flowers or something like that oh so i said well why don't you have rain and bethany go up the aisle it's real flowers yeah what'd she say she said she would um talk about it more she thought that was kind of a neat idea yeah she was wondering if they would do it they're old enough i think she would you think she would uh-huh where that would be so cute i think she would that would be so especially issues with ryan you know ryan could hold her hand yeah rancor all their hand ryan's old enough to i think he's we'd have to do that by the you know i mean he's he'll be three and a half ass and she's one and a half you know by then she just by then she's she'll be almost too yeah i mean she she she follows directions now mhm you know she take something off the four utility bill clinton garbage she will mhm you know and anytime we take her diaper off or whatever and and you know playing on the floor she picks it up and go to put it in the garbage mhm you know so she can follow the directions mhm yeah i mean she could do it with all the people scare her out of it i don't think so because she's not shy at all not shy people well gosh wouldn't that be the cutest thing you've ever seen yeah that'd be smoke you can <unk> it'd be so nice we'd have we'd have to see you know <unk> the other thing i was thinking is different isn't <unk> mhm <unk> wouldn't be totally inappropriate for him to be kind of up in the front you know right kinda crouching down and daddy's there she go jail problem right she'd go yeah and especially you know if i if i sent her off and daddy was down there she yeah go and and alright would have to do was would be take her hand and you know he gets er flowers and she probably follow suit if she didn't know what to do right you know and even some of the flower girls even some of them don't even pro flowers <unk> they just carry flowers <unk> yeah you know what i mean yeah so that would that would even be a problem right that would be cute i mean if they're doing <unk> <unk> <unk> they might as well do the flowers yeah yeah so [laughter] we'll see what they say that's cool yeah well that'd be kinda fun yeah she said <unk> yeah yeah i think we're

yeah i wouldn't be good at that but i'm not that type <unk> you know i'd do it but sure about that and like you have to have a title to do those things yeah but i think <unk> you know what i think actually is that she there was too many sisters they couldn't have any of them in the stand up for them uh-huh and so that but they <unk> don't want anybody to feel not important yeah so they made jobs for all of them well i kind of yeah i kind of did with my friends i'm like sherry brown had her as my personal attendance <unk> she came late i'm not late to the wedding but she didn't get there

not interested in going on the road or anything like that oh i see um i have some relatives are in a gospel singing group and they do that and it's just very time consuming and so now that i'd want to get into that that um she that's good though you know give something back you know we need as many good teachers now right in my goal is to just really learn how to be a good teacher 'cause uh there's

thing to learn how to sing and if you can sing that then you can adjust your voice to sound country or iraq or anything else uh-huh but you can't just because you can sing <unk> our country or something else doesn't mean you can sing opera but it was it's it's really it's really technical and it's hard to learn were you at uh you said you're a university of texas no ah right now i'm at a

know that you know <unk> and other there's other possibilities you know another place to live i mean people are still finding like you know i know people that are still finding like lofts in brooklyn when <unk> that are like cheaper that would be the kind of thing that you might want to change your living situation yeah oh yeah it's just letting go problems letting him have had it for so long you

now it's good it's bad it's it's weird it's it's definitely like first of all i'm like i came i've been out here for about six weeks now it's taking me a while to settle in it's definitely a lot [laughter] oh man it's horrible it's so disgusting i mean i hear weather reports for their i'm like oh gee i know and i wake up in the morning and it's overcast and the sun doesn't china thing is in new york city it might be hot but at least like the sun is shining yeah or you'll get those those big city breezes like <unk> you know [laughter] and you get <unk> they don't even know like you're so lucky and then it moves like there'll be a thunderstorm in the afternoon and everybody runs out to try to get some air and it's like and then it's gone and then like it's the the hotter russian is there <unk> yeah exactly and it's like all the steam rising off the ground [noise] but um okay so i don't like the weather and i think that i feel like i'm in the suburbs because i don't have a car and i feel like i need a car to get around <unk> that i need to get too because <unk> scattered around it they're like it's like being like at mcdowell but without the god but without the um you know the fact that like somebody goes on a daily basis into town or you know those kinds of things it's it's definitely like you get a really cheap one well i'm going <unk> yeah yeah yeah i'm thinking about getting a junk mobile i was thinking about <unk> i wanted to get like a like a real like something that i could have for a couple of years or something like that you know and i've been looking <unk> haven't really seen a few [laughter] i've gotten into this bad habit of remember when i was an undergrad and i used to watch star trek reruns really <unk> [laughter] i'm watching star trek reruns at midnight because there's a great guy that that that i've gotten to be friends with a couple of people that i've got to be friends with actually they watch star trek at midnight like not the next generation though <unk> it is well it's the one with captain <unk> card <unk> i don't know which one that is that's the <unk> yeah it's the earlier ones i like the new one next generation and <unk> [laughter] into it so bad anyway so that's why i'm yawning um but um anyway ah what was going to say um so it took me a while to settle in cars and <unk> and i'm still not totally settled in i've started to do some work [noise] i did the first month that i was here i took a class in digital music cool like electronic you know like music editing and stuff like that oh that's great <unk> because i've been you know working with sound and i'm interested in working more with sound and stuff and so that was really good we there was <unk> at the end of it and i felt pretty good about my contribution to that like it wasn't really exactly what i would walk but i felt like great yeah so that was <unk> that was good that was something that you know like <unk> being here gave me access to a multiple learning a lot about computers like i'm like about other things about computers like about um you know how to do email and how to do like emails <unk> interesting networking yeah yeah i mean you get if you get a laptop and you should also try to get a modem and hook it up to a phone because then you can have well i mean like i have a laptop i have a [noise] an email address i don't know who else that you know has an email address but it's a kind of thing that i would like <unk> contact with people <unk> <unk> yeah i'm trying to like help <unk> because it only costs like a local phone call like if you if you call new york i mean if you want it to write to somebody in new york you could like you could like type it uh like uh stocks thing yeah it's but it's <unk> it's even cheaper than a facts i think because it's <unk> it goes into the computer it's not like with paper right now with paper but it's it's cheaper because it's the cost of a local phone call whereas <unk> takes the amount of time <unk> really agree and you can get access to all any <unk> any information you really need i mean if you needed something about research or whatever right right yeah amazing yeah so yeah like the internet and all that kinda stuff so that's that's like so i'm learning about that so that's kinda cool and um and then uh [noise] and i'm supposed to start teaching in september i mean a little bit nervous about that because i have to still put together <unk> i'm like a course syllabus [laughter] john come on [laughter] for two weeks away [noise] i know [laughter] i know and you can talk about email and stuff like that [laughter] no joking with you but <unk> that's okay i'm just joking but [laughter] okay [laughter] what was the hold on one second you know what i have to go to the bathroom hold all right i can't bring the phone <unk> see what happens to fall into the bathroom now it doesn't stretch hold on [noise] [noise] [noise] hi who's paying for this call the university of pennsylvania oh fat [laughter] and um so anyway [laughter] so um [noise] well yeah it's like i i i am a little <unk> i mean the thing is i never taught a class well that's not true i taught the same class in germany but it was different uh what about upstate new york you didn't <unk> that was teaching i was teaching three d. design which is really different because that was freshmen these are like graduate students really <unk> well that's that's intense well how many how often do i teach twice it's twice a week for we meet for three hours [noise] and um so anyway so that's going on and so um [noise] but i mean it's good it's weird like i've been having you know the thing about your <unk> saying like about you know like giving up the apartment in new york and those kinds of things i mean i've been thinking about those kinds of things again also because you know i think to myself like you know i can make life easier for myself i could come <unk> berlin i could probably like you know <unk> <unk> you know <unk> you know get the paperwork and order and maybe <unk> very easily yeah and make away for myself in berlin and or i could you know or you know god knows i mean this this thing here like theoretically i'm you can stay a another year like you can um i could apply for an extension for another year really yeah but <unk> but then i think like you know do i want to do that and and do i want to like leave you know i know i don't know it just feels like <unk> you can see <unk> you'll know better <unk> and you're like right for <unk> you know i know and that's the hardest <unk> i mean for me it's just like going back to new york would be great but <unk> it's like you know i just don't know <unk> you don't want that life again right for <unk> great i mean but here it's like if i can get to the point where i can leave a little bit more often and go other other countries and <unk> <unk> you know your are closer but it's just i think the berlin it gets to be very small it's like living out in brooklyn i mean you have your neighborhoods you have the same people you see and and that's okay but it gets to be a little bit <unk> a little bit too close <unk> right right right so i think your can feel that way sometimes too though yeah i know i mean i all i did there was <unk> it may work and you know live in brooklyn so yeah it is the same thing and [noise] you know maybe i'm just getting tired of it all i mean or [noise] you know it's like you know when <unk> it was different before when you know i just you know i did my work and um you know went home and you know try to you know <unk> <unk> i'm trying to get work together or just trying to develop but now it's it's a different thing and it's like that but plus all this other politics that i never was a part of before and makes it you know it's like oh this is this really what it's all about and <unk> as do i really really want to be part of this you know because it's like you know it's not really what i am into you know the other <unk> the other side of it all the business the [noise] yeah the <unk> politics of it oh of the art making <unk> of the art world right <unk> you know and it's it's okay but it's it takes a lot of time and you know oh god you know [noise] and um you know all this <unk> writing grandson knowing that you know you probably get 'em and dealing with rejection [laughter] i know it's <unk> it's not easy but i know it's part of it you know what the hell is wrong with me i mean but you know part of the <unk> it's just part of it all you know and i know you know like working and you know <unk> you know what about what's gonna happen ten years from now or they can't [noise] you know like how long can i do this and what am i getting from it kind of thing right and uh you know <unk> <unk> are you saving money for the old age and shit like that [noise] you know it's just like you know who's gonna you gotta think about these things after a while yeah yeah and so that's kind of thing and more i committed here you know wondering how could go back there so when i'm thinking about ideal is trying to you know i'm doing <unk> start working on that and you know try to change the time i go back to new york and try to keep trying to get in and try to get in the union and the <unk> at some point in a couple of years but i do ever get in then i have this possibility to like work there and you know although i'm sure frank has told you that it's also not it hasn't been that easy for him <unk> like in the beginning <unk> now he's getting work but in the beginning it wasn't so they're still like a kind of a rough transition period yeah i like you can imagine where of yeah sure i mean it's not so easy i know but it's yeah it's getting connection that's like the same thing getting connects people who know who you are right right <unk> that kind of i mean that's one <unk> the idea but you know the question is about <unk> <unk> if i want to go back to that <unk> you know doing keep on how long do i want to keep doing it right like how <unk> you know they will do that when you're forty five yeah she is i think we should play lotto i think it'd be lot lot better and how's your little friend in new york oh you mean this guy this guy this man that's stupid got well [laughter] fucker [laughter] exactly <unk> what <unk> he always good either yeah i'm here <unk> he was supposed to come to my house the night before not the night before but the saturday night before i left before i came here <unk> he was just <unk> come visit for like to see each other and have dinner or whatever talk whatever and he didn't come and he didn't call really and then he had this like lame like i knew that it was because of his um his girlfriend but he didn't <unk> that was the case i knew that something can happen there but he had this really like lame way of like this you know like <unk> dealing with it and then i and then and then they made my last week at work really really bad because i it made me really bummed out 'cause i had really liked working there and he was one of the reasons why i really would like <unk> don't know <unk> then you know after the sake of noxious thing i was like this is you know the horrible <unk> he's really bad so the honest with you <unk> it's <unk> i mean like <unk> it's not you don't need that shed that's ridiculous i know and <unk> don't call i know and <unk> so i realized that howard so i realized that what was going on with that i was like that i was i'm projecting on to him who i i wanted him to be your who i've known <unk> was like i i wasn't really looking at who he was i was like <unk> i was like <unk> making trying to make him somebody who <unk> friends <unk> exactly so and <unk> many [laughter] so anyway so that's like not you know so actually though at the moment though i'm trying to like i'm sort of like a said let me tell you what i'm doing [laughter] things that i'm sure about i'm doing i'm going i'm getting it and i'm trying to get in shape i'm going swimming granny everyday which actually i've stopped for a little while because i also started judo again which i use really kid <unk> [laughter] yeah [laughter] at a rate but i went i went last weekend and i and i like injured myself i thought that i i brewed my ribs but it ends up i probably what i did was like i pulled muscle or something is that why you went to the doctor no i went to the doctor because i have insurance this year and i [laughter] i want to get a regular general checkup and i wanna like you know be like you know in a quote unquote normal person that that is able to go to the doctor and you know what i mean a habit yeah <unk> it's like <unk> you know like six something while you're at you know and <unk> you know i'm and i'm going <unk> good night <unk> having to me like a general physical and they're checking my blood from the latest because that was never ever checked afterwards and stuff you know it's all this kinda so you're okay [noise] so yeah i'm okay [laughter] yeah i was getting like really i've been getting really out of breath so we'll <unk> for a long long long time and that's one of the things like i wanted to ask the doctor i you know why is that you know it's it's something wrong or is it just you know getting older or whatever like i don't know that's that's true <unk> yeah it was like god i'm so exhausted from smoking or just getting <unk> smoking you know i still haven't started smoking from when i quit hepatitis and i still good i don't drink i drink some sometimes but i don't drink that much anymore <unk> good very good um you know and um so anyway but see certain getting shame work on the body you have a whole you got the <unk> you got the time they're <unk> <unk> well exactly and it's but it's <unk> like injured myself in judo so i have to wait a little while like it was really hurting right now it's off [laughter] i'm gonna take like another <unk> another week or something and <unk> [laughter] i know i know i know it's funny 'cause my head remembers things that my body can do yeah <unk> remember it's really hard on your knees and she does <unk> know <unk> it's all about balancing and wait displacement and and using the energy of your of your opponent to get them off balance and oh that's good you know to throw them and stuff like yeah some ass when you get back to new york [laughter] yeah straighten out the neighborhood you know because <unk> don't know anything that's great so so that's so that's like that so that's like the one thing that i'm like sort of concentrated concentrating on that i know that i'm doing and then <unk> as far as like the art work stuff goes like i've got this project and i'm working on and i'm <unk> i'm going to kind of you know just develop that and i don't know what i'm going to do this year in terms of like outreach or any of that kinda stuff i'm i'm not sure if i'm if i'm gonna try to <unk> i might just try to concentrate on my work and then do all that stuff at the end yeah that have like making it part of my you know daily existence to do that or i don't know i have to see how <unk> what do you mean by outraged <unk> sending stuff <unk> oh yeah yeah <unk> and that kinda stuff like that kind of keeping yeah i'm keeping balance i guess yeah yeah i mean yeah use the tie that you know the thing is is if people don't hear from you then it's like you know they don't hear from you and what are you up to i don't know exactly anyway so [laughter] so let me so let me so i have to tell you about my dilemma i don't know how much more time we have <unk> they're going to come on and say you have one minute ladder really some point yeah so then we'll have to hang up but actually then i could call you back and just pay for <unk> recall or something like that but [noise] um the um [noise] uh um there are <unk> gone <unk> <unk> in a little <unk> <unk> yeah well it was partly also because like i was talking to this to this it was like first they said oh you <unk> you know he's kinda cute and then there was like and then it was like well i'll because i'm living in i should tell you i'm living in something that sort of like a dormitory <unk> but it's not really a dormitory it's like um come in it's sort of like a big commune yeah but it's like but it's institutional it feels institutional it's not like a house it's a it's a building with like you know like <unk> little bit [laughter] like what <unk> last battalion i'm like well no but it's nothing it's <unk> it's like it's like um if <unk> hospitality and was like you know made in nineteen sixty outta send your dog [laughter] it's like it's like it's like all these apartment building right <unk> that kind of feel vase you know more like an apartment block type thing yeah sure and so it's the <unk> you you live in the sweet with their sixteen people into swea you've got like an upstairs downstairs and you've got two sides like <unk> you know the the two sides of the hall and so there's four people on each side and you share hung out this guy [laughter] anyway it's like we're sitting outside so

top like [laughter] it was like oh man apparently my friend joseph who i was bored watching with apparently saw him right after this occurred and said to him said were you flirting with my friend joan [laughter] really and i was i was like i can't [laughter] and he said well i wanted to put the idea and it said if it hadn't already occurred to him and i said oh well i said you know you're such a jewish mother and everything so anyway so so this is going on okay for the past like we get you know are so i saw that there's like these little conversations and you know little inkling in the sense that maybe there's you know the sense that you know i if i was in any way he's taking um he's taking an exam on saturday for entrance to medical school wow <unk> that's good <unk> [laughter] some medical man [laughter] and uh well actually he and he has his masters in middle eastern studies <unk> um [noise] but um okay but so he's real cute but so then way then it gets further complicated because last night joseph my my little my little boy watcher friend and i he's usually mom [laughter] joseph <unk> really sweet um he he um we're talking and um and he somehow i don't know <unk> <unk> i was saying something and then he said something and he said oh no i'm not going to say that and i said what he says i'm not going to say he said it was gonna say something about <unk> knock or north <unk> this other guy here who when i <unk> i kinda thought oh you know he's really whatever and you know i kind of was like feeling him out like you know talking to him about some things and feeling him out and i just got the distinct impression that he wasn't interested in that he that he like even available yeah <unk> well not the wasn't available but the wasn't interested yeah also interesting lee enough he's iranian and he's um and he's from the same town that all these <unk> oh you're kidding <unk> they probably know each other [laughter] i actually am both of them and they don't know [laughter] no [laughter] but um [noise] but but but but he's but he's personality wise and and stuff like that um or i mean there's things about him that are very different <unk> i mean obviously there are some but there's some things that are very similar and there's some things um you know anyway so so i'm like i'm you know so i'm like <unk> so anyway so so comes out last night joseph comes out with this thing like um well you know he's <unk> he's <unk> information <unk> her <unk> few days ago or something like that <unk> likes yeah yeah or something like <unk> and the thing is is that apparently he's not the kind of person he's <unk> he's like to some extent kind of reserved and all that kinda stuff he's not the kind of person that's gonna do anything or pursue something and the thing is that he has been privy he has like listens to these conversations where i've been talking about this other guy oh yeah so that so that like yesterday so that i felt really weird because yesterday that i went by his room and i knocked on the door and i was like talking to him and he said oh i thought <unk> at dinner i said and i was like oh yeah uh-huh 'cause i like i was like i shouldn't talk to him about joe and then joseph other guy the guy studying for his medical yeah so i like now i'm like <unk> what do i do now [laughter] as well and joseph <unk> see that's what i you know because <unk> just said something to me like what are you going to do with he said what are you going to do with joe if something happens with now so i said i said nothing and he said well you can't do that he said don't you think he knows it you're just biting your time until the end <unk> over and and um and you know you've been like openly flirting with him and stuff like that and i said well yeah and i was like what do you want me due date both of them and he says no and i'm like and i kind of not well first of all we live we all live in the same house [laughter] it was only problematic um yeah but the thing is so i'm like <unk> you know go slow and get to know both of them really well and then <unk> you know go from there [laughter] you know what it's like in the hot steamy rather [laughter] like i feel like ah what's her face land shit [laughter] why that long [laughter] i've always depended on the kind <unk> strangers [laughter] well that is a dilemma [laughter] do you have yourself a problem there playing [laughter] one of the i mean i mean first well lately like more well i'm i i know nicer better so i so the thing is is that with no sir <unk> with nicer it's i think with joe there's like a more sort of like um sort of like core <unk> physical um last yeah because that's great well less does good well right except for that i think last can happen anywhere because i mean it's true you know i'm not i'm not the kind of person that i mean like <unk> [laughter] i've been able to i've i've been certainly you know had my share of like people who <unk> i've been attracted to and it's good or not necessarily there there wasn't necessarily like an immediate last thing yeah and it just develops and then it's just you know it's <unk> you know it can be like as like that sexiest hell you know yeah [laughter] i can't wait to get the tape from idaho right they're taping it right now somebody listening to it right now i'm sure but um no the thing

the end of the month so and if september what's <unk> going to say he's gonna have to lump it i don't know what he's going to look forward to having to deal with it well how far away are you being done not really very far so maybe i'll be able to get it done by the middle of the month so i'm not really very for it it's it's you know it's a question of having a few so used to work on trying to say well i mean is it too much to ask you to just take just come up to windsor and finish it after you get back where we've got <unk> regarding move and we've got to got to do my classes so probably you know but you know i'm <unk> i'm only teaching one class so i just would feel better if you had it done before you turned up at the department i mean you can make the thirty first you don't start teaching until when are six oh lord yeah no it's yeah i don't i don't you know i i don't think it's going to be a big deal i i really kind of doubt that show will be ready to go she was already talking about sort of spring oh good yeah but she's cause she can she's got more leeway than you i think yeah but i've got so much going for she goes i know a large risk if they don't tenure you we'll sue them too but it'll work out but anyway i'm i'm <unk> i mean i caught myself today just getting edgy well look um but but if you change your mind and you want to just come right up to windsor and tim finesse the move <unk> don't know i don't want to do that i don't want to do that it'll <unk> it'll be better to do the move right away anyway 'cause you know i can't come home and go right to work just <unk> you'll be exhausted yeah and i won't want to do it won't be able to culture right whereas we can do things spending together time together and moving moving then it's fine yeah alright well i'm like i guess we'll have to figure out our respective movements when when it gets closer but i'm going to um ashfield with greg tomorrow and i'm a beer well greg and join a gym and the kids are leaving for japan tomorrow uh-huh and i'm a greg's going to go on a hiking trip with a friend uh-huh but he's going to um stop by ashville to drop off the dogs so he can take me and the baby up uh-huh and then i'll maybe come back down with him he's coming back down i guess ten days later uh-huh i mean he's not staying the whole time but he'll come back the last weekend of the month i think they said and then go back down to new york and he can probably take us then because it's gotten to be i just moving on my own is just very very difficult oh dear [noise] um well and i'm going to try and get back to work on my paper which is just ridiculous but i'm going to make an effort and well we can both make an effort you know you can <unk> finished when you finish your paper yeah although you know cuny classes start really early yeah but then don't you have all those holidays that's true [laughter] that's a good point i should really use those shouldn't i i haven't lone lined up any child care yet i'm being really flaky about it and i know i'm gonna hate myself later you really oughta take this semester off but did i tell you this is the last year of the job it's <unk> <unk> is that for sure it's not for sure yet but um but they've sent cuny a letter saying that the president did not ask for funding for it in his budget and it looks quite doubtful that the senate is gonna want to put it back in um [noise] so that cuny thinks that this is the last year of it so i'm reluctant to take a semester off considering that i would only then have one semester left well anyway <unk> you know this is i mean apart from the tenure book you know this is all gonna be a killing term for only teaching one class that i've taught at before uh-huh so you know and and i well once your tenure file goes in i'll be ready to believe that but until you get it in i don't think you should have i think you should have you know you should not be cutting corners on putting that file together that's like critical for us so i don't want you to <unk> i don't want you to take on a a lot of extra stuff at the beginning 'cause it doesn't make sense you believe me dear once you get tenure i will have <unk> good [laughter] [noise] especially because you're gonna be away every summer you're really going to have to do a lot of you're gonna have to take a lot of responsibility during the year to make me feel like things are at all equal but not <unk> not immediately this semester just because <unk> that you know you you've got a child now you've got to get tenure [laughter] [noise] so what was the what was your trip in what was the time <unk> new mexico like oh god it was horrible really horrible <unk> i <unk> i was so tense and the baby was so unhappy <unk> and i think she just <unk> i think that's what it is because the minute i got here i relaxed completely and she's been just an angel that makes perfect <unk> you know what the dogs yeah it was awful <unk> you know we may get cut off at some um and so if we do you know i'll <unk> i'll call you when i get to ashfield okay um it was just awful they i was stuck up on that hill <unk> they only had the legend uh-huh and i had i they kept telling me i didn't need to rent a car which i absolutely did um so anyway i didn't have my own transportation they were buying a house they have now bought a house so they were just out driving around old they were completely stressed out they had finished looking by the time i got there but they were debating they were making trying to make an offer and alexis you know has no confidence about this and he had the most ridiculous realtor you've ever seen 'em and uh he hates owning property any any could only buy a house for three hundred and thirty thousand dollars which was about half of what he wanted to spend and um he was a <unk> and then joel showed up uh-huh jemma was there and mom was picking on jemma like she always does even though jemma's adult <unk> joel then turned up the day after i arrived and drove us mad [laughter] robe us crazy he was more obnoxious than he's ever been out of you know you ever see that ages well jemma said so i think i have greater tolerance for <unk> i think you do definitely does i think you do but he really was he really was a pain in the neck and jemma said it's because his girlfriend just dumped him [noise] um but anyway so mom and alexis were freaking out because of that but they have no ability to set any limits you know so like they can't say to joel look you know go away for a while or i mean she couldn't say <unk> you know they can come that week <unk> <unk> you know <unk> and we were supposed to go to dinner one night and they showed up unexpectedly they were supposed to be out they had gone to the grand canyon and we didn't expect him back and they showed up unexpectedly and you know they mom and alexis couldn't could not bring themselves <unk> say we're taking claire out to a nice dinner or see you later this is our only evening with her yeah you know we want to have some time with her they couldn't <unk> supposed to say that but they were so upset that he'd come back the <unk> the the evening was just like a complete was painful and we went to a different restaurant a cheap restaurant i mean it was it was just painful and i i felt so pissed off because you know there was expecting <unk> family vacation i mean it was supposed to be a family vacation and it was like it was like so stressful i mean i don't know why i didn't know why i had bothered to go yeah and then you know eve eve and seth were down in their house and mom's hall of her energies seemed to be going towards protecting eve from too many distractions because eve had to work so you know there was you couldn't dodi

4616-0000603-0001845 so what does it do now we wait for it to beep i guess ah we can go ahead and talk yeah and um [laughter] yeah i guess we can well what's happening over there well i have really i don't have too much news you're the one with the news yeah you're the one whose are going <unk> tell me about seven forty <unk> well <unk> <unk> it's it's a tied up right now oh i have um put a deposit on it i went over to buy it and the man didn't have a title mhm and come to find out what had happened he has some ah his lebanese he's been living over here from here <unk> his lebanese and he's been in america for eighteen years old <unk> and what does ended up happening it's turned out to be quite an answer to prayer because number one i needed a car and i um had looked at the number <unk> man <unk> through prayer you know the thing that came to me was to pray for what i wanted what about you know i still didn't want to spend a lot of money and so on but i did one of the ball though i didn't want <unk> seven forty um and if not seven forty in eighty six or newer oh so that's what i prayed for either <unk> forty that was eighty six or <unk> or i would take 'em i'd taken eighty five seven forty <unk> so what i ended up finding was an eighty seven seven forty that need work <unk> <unk> and now i looked it up in the bucket mainly the head gasket and i looked it up to see if that was a job i felt like doing and uh it'll be the biggest job i've ever done on the car but i think i'll go ahead and give it a try <unk> and i'm <unk> the bottom line is you may remember my mentioning some while back that i was preaching in alaska uh back in january right and i'm making a long story short through the course of that service i begin to feel like i needed to be engagement outrage among some of the arabic people here in the detroit area and haven't known how to start <unk> been praying for contacts with arabic people well through looking for this car i've got it oh what ended up happening is um i went over to get the vending number sunday night so that i could get my insurance by mon you know on on monday morning and then go over and right car and bring it home and a while we were talking i said what country are you from his uh lebanon and now so i said to him i said uh people like you are what make america great the immigrants <unk> and now <unk> interesting observation he said he said that in eighteen years of living here no one ever said that to him huh that all he'd heard was you guys come over here you take all our money he says yeah he says we take the money he says we taking the jobs where we're working <unk> just like anyone else who works mhm so there's been a lot of hostility and detroit toward the arabic people and um oh so in any case through that remark what happened is when i went over there on monday he said he was very embarrassed you didn't have the title and what has happened is he's been running a religion shop so about a month ago he had gone over to an auction to buy a car for his wife and he had bought this <unk> and then uh it had a mechanical problem he didn't even want to try to mess with it at one mechanic said it's the head gasket one city is the from stat mhm and he said if it's just the <unk> and i'm getting a car that needs almost no work for twenty five hundred but the bottom line is he's selling it to me basically for what he's got in it uh-huh and now it's just something he doesn't want to work on the car right and uh uh so so that's what's happened but meanwhile the title is tied up in lancing oh because it's <unk> recovery mhm so um the insurance company hit <unk> you know and he's been driving it for a month but um you know to register just one thing but to have a title in your hand <unk> mother so um he said that <unk> it could be as much as to more weeks before he gets mhm or could arrive in the mail today yeah but meanwhile uh he was so embarrassed about that whole thing he had man i had coffee within a i have somewhere to buy pine nuts we've been to a few of the arabic restaurants here in town and daddy's taking liking pine nuts those wife ended up giving us the big bag of pine nuts oh and uh you know plus we know where to get them now yes plus they want to get together and um i'll have dinner together yeah and uh he seems to be a muslim though he's talking more like a hindu <unk> it's it all roads lead the same god yeah oh life <unk> you know so in any case it's it's <unk> turned out to be not just one but to answer to prayer <unk> you know with a bit of a delay thrown in but right of i'm not real anxious about that frankly by the time i get the car probably the heat wave all breaking it won't be working on it yeah i'm a one hour of your check <unk> first oh yeah mhm <unk> are so powerful evaporated all er all it needs well if it does need a head gasket so i i looked it up and <unk> looks like ball but it's probably one of the easiest cars there is to change if i bring my tours around <unk> till you yeah okay yeah but i'm going to have to get a get one that's better calibrate it oh because i'm <unk> um it's it's just something where um they they make a kind where you said <unk> click and so on i have to do that because i've been <unk> maybe you can trade off for a time where to turn the one i brought up a into the <unk> i don't know how you know i mean you know i've never heard of trading tools but yeah well <unk> you know unless it was with a person but <unk> but um yeah the other one is fine for things like sitting we'll bearings and that kinda thing mhm but i'm i'm i'm going to have to have real <unk> on though right ahead but the way i look at it is upon buying all four to five thousand dollar car for twenty five hundred and i have to go out and spend forty dollars on rent so i'm not looking worry about it yeah no no [noise] i'm very well remember <unk> couple of times we want <unk> one time i think maybe twice this lebanese restaurant mhm is there any connection there are not really <unk> i'm not sure which one we went to but ah well one of the same one yeah and all i can remember as it was on a busy <unk> street <unk> and of course there are a lot of busy wide streets in detroit and there was one <unk> yeah and um so well that sounds interesting sounds like you've got a um got another good deal and <unk> and uh making yeah and um and if that title doesn't work out and i i can you know i've got all the information i mean where i can collect my deposit back but <unk> um if it doesn't work out the friendship maybe more important than the car anyway yeah mhm well i i imagine it's all going to um work out for <unk> for <unk> goes them mhm and uh oh well um i guess i've been reading a message

before i realized i passed [laughter] yeah that's good <unk> relative to do that plow through it yeah that's true <unk> and uh so [noise] i'm not sure <unk> is that are available um i i know you order that from this place in massachusetts is they're available in bookstores as far as i know it is um christian book distributors just has good prices mhm and um they generally have everything <unk> down <unk> anywhere from a little bit too a lot yeah no they sent me a catalogue and have a lot of books i'd sure like the gap yeah no me price reduction how i got a about the last two or three pages and now it's funny <unk> <unk> are the ones i bark from fifty to seventy seventy five percent <unk> yeah that does that tell you something about that pays ten bucks [laughter] not really i think what it says is uh how long the book it's been on the market oh well because a lot of times the newest books or you know federal supply and demand thing mhm and it hasn't gotten to where there's any kind of a lot of supply yet although in the process of distributing above whereas when it when it's been on the market for a while uh i've i've found some uh john <unk> stuff <unk> a few years ago <unk> would've sold for top dollar but now they've got <unk> down quite a bit mhm and ah so what maybe i'll have to consider that too i've i've just mess say something about my my taste or something [laughter] i'm off in one corner or something yeah you're right about that i hadn't thought about pretty well a lot of books they have <unk> way down are classics mhm and so and they always have a a good price on things like <unk> can cordon's some standard reference works yeah <unk> uh ourselves and one of the best bars on ever bought one i remember in atlanta uh there was a place up are just awful beautiful die already and i bought strongest complete can recordings for four dollars <unk> <unk> oh yeah yeah that's i think that's one of the best buy that book i've ever made <unk> it's still a very pleasant blurred <unk> still have used it a lot red tiled offer <unk> course i'm easier on books anyway yeah and uh so i figure that has to be one of the best buys i've ever made <unk> and oh boy <unk> one of the gran rewards of old age [laughter] plus had a friend got a triumph a t._r. seven nine percent of the mountain doing errands for me you know and they came back so i've got the parts for the car i'm going to beef up the suspension before i drive to new york tomorrow all <unk> you're going <unk> yeah yeah and i'm speaking it'll reunion then i'll be uh the church bob lakers pastime sunday morning yeah and uh they bought <unk> bother <unk> personnel ah he's been there but the he's been passed from church there and what has happened there's there's been um i guess the church it's kind of split off from school all and uh by that everything he could keep split from being in any way ugly <unk> anything but it's it's just i'm afraid gotten kind of out of hand yeah and um sports usually do well no he's not in atlanta no he's he's living in a i think in little fall okay and tom sarah limbo diarrhea thomas in syracuse oh mcgary it just didn't pan out for them to live there now he just came back from a trip there and it's <unk> uh one of those remarkable stories of of a divine appointment <unk> he was planning at first to go with a doctor for who's a teacher <unk> pine crest they were going to go to bulgaria together if they've been there before and there's a little town or a little church over dough brits i say little it's about three hundred people <unk> i'm <unk> i guess kinda large for my circle fellowship but in any case ah dough brits his over toward the er let's say middle eastern into bulgaria said he used to be called toll booth can and when i'm at some point i think right after the second world war maybe between the first and second world war would have been the um romanians on that part of bulgaria oh so in any case i'm thomas been to the church over there and dough brits quite a number of times so he doctor fort were going to go to bulgaria and then they were going to go on to a bible school in russia <unk> one of the pine crest graduate <unk> started and running and um well making a long story short ah didn't pan out to go to russia tom hadn't felt like god was dealing with him to go to russia anyway so the bottom line was um he cancelled that trip <unk> completely changed <unk> plans someone had given him a prophecy about changing his plans and the next thing you know uh russia fell through so he changed his plans and he went with bill pepper now bell peppers a contemporary weighed taylor though he's probably twenty years young all <unk> that <unk> wait we're bible school together <unk> <unk> have <unk> ministry who started um instead of about a dozen churches in peru and ah raised up leaders and and then he moved to alaska all <unk> any case <unk> was going to a um a some kind of a minister's conference the packers conference in the czech republic so the deal was tom would meet him there and then they would go to dope it's together mhm so they went to the czech republic tom had a real good time there i feel like you're probably will turn their next time he goes to eastern europe then they went down to um bulgaria they had to kill a day in socio arrived in the morning they're clean left ah i think it leaves at like eight or nine at night and you're on the train overnight you wake up at six in the morning <unk> <unk> so um they had time to kill and they were out some open air marketing a woman came up toon said are you american tom says yes i am a didn't take much of that because he and build we're speaking english to each other she says <unk> have <unk> are you in the ministry c._s._i. and she said have you preached with doctor forward <unk> he said yes i have right now he's parking not really interested she said your name tom sawyer is so what it came down to was there was a um there was a pastor from <unk> which is right on the border of romania basically and the pastor is ah looking to do some open air meetings and villages now it's illegal right now just to go into town and have an open air gospel meeting in bulgaria <unk> but if the city officials ask for it and then of course you can do it oh so in other words they have a liberty to ask and then if they ask when you have the liberty to do it uh-huh so this past her uh who's also an evangelist has gotten invitation swimming number villages about his biggest problem with money or so again what ended up happening tom had some extra money to give to the bulgarian people when he was there would have been donating for that purpose and it seems that cost about a hundred dollars per crusade most of the expense being the transportation for the people who participate in the cruise for the equipment <unk> the system that kind of thing and like they have to hire taxes or something uh because of all the equipment they have to carry over there musical instruments and that sort of thing so anyway it's about a hundred dollars apiece so time getting five hundred dollars and they are now going to be working like killing snakes in order to have five of these meetings before the elections in october it's possible but if the elections bringing a new government but there'll be a complete change of policy <unk> man they may or may not be able to continue with the open air meetings you know so in any case then then i'm from that contact they went onto <unk> when they got to dough brits the pastor we're still the pastor but he decided he would not take a salary anymore and he started selling ice cream i'm just as a as a street vendor <unk> well what's happening there is he's now spending more time with the people in this church when he was before huh because in communist countries they have usually fantastic what good um uh public transit system mhm and of course part of the reason for that is that the economy doesn't support everyone having their own car oh so so they have these marvelous public transportation systems and the downtown in dover is is a really if they did something like this here in the states that would <unk> over great it's like a big open air mall oh and i bet it's half a mile long some places it's probably a quarter of a mile deep gee several blocks deep um and it's but that's <unk> <unk> so of course the traffic can drive up to this thing and i think there are a couple of allie's where trucks and come back through their uh to you know to service the shops and whatnot right but when <unk> said and done the the <unk> things but desperate and <unk> and um so that's where <unk> men selling his ice cream and an hour for the day probably most of the church will end up in that mall for one reason or another [laughter] so he's being more of the people as nice clean them and he was a pastor even probably make more money too and they don't even realize it you know what i mean it's just a weird situation yeah it's an interesting turn of events then all the elders and the church had resigned not because they were just grumbled and wanted to leave but because they felt that they were not bearing the fruits and needed to be bearing in and they felt that it was just an active submissions turn in their outlawed to resign and if god wanted them to continue that he would somehow speak so what ended up happening is built pepper having annapolis dollar ministry haven't started uh literally dozens of churches and having been sort of a um a <unk> said you were with a number of other people who have started purchased bill has a pretty strong idea of what works and what doesn't mhm and um so he didn't just try to dictate to them what they ought to do he just started asking questions oh and by the time <unk> few days there were over um he does some bleeding questions the various ministers ministers there in the church had prayed about it and by the time he left the elders we're back on board or the pastor is now thinking of himself as a pastor again the um uh churches excited moving forward the elders now have new responsibilities but they didn't have before and um so it it was just a tremendous visitation god for that particular church because we gave him a nuisance of direction and purpose and uh i i guess the way bill handled it was that he didn't think of himself as being someone called interest to tell them what to do but it was more a matter of kind of awakening the talent we're already there and the people though <unk> it was just to flip it tom went with bell pepper they never expected to get there and find the church ready to reorganize ah but it it that's how <unk> went <unk> sort of sort of like um x. all over the twentieth century yeah mhm and uh things have happened here and <unk> and and when <unk> when you go when you leave tomorrow for new york how long or you'll be going i'm going to be coming home sunday night oh i've got the men from the church going with my and one of them has to be back for work on monday mhm yeah <unk> know were told that one oh so we've got a um a green one <unk> and um i kinda but at the same way i'm buying <unk> seven forty <unk> um

4622-0000000-0000541 <unk> publicly distributed that sounds interesting yes well i think i'll go for it right now no exciting conversation [laughter] well i was wondering how much uh we'd be able to talk about if your family's around anyway oh well they'll just have to live with it [laughter] yeah so well let's see now where do we leave off oh jeeze i guess i could start with your email address on my email address yeah you can reach me at a rio diet a._o._l. dot com um yeah i tried sending something to you i'm ah d._w._i. e._e._o. aunt a._o._l. the w._t._o. yeah at a._o._l. dot com <unk> town yeah okay that work well i sent it so let me know if you were saying even right i didn't get any messages you back saying a user unknown or whatever it is unknown address okay so i presume that it went through and you were saying that <unk> that's uh one of <unk> andersons yeah it's like an idea of of his a._o._l. account mhm so um my friend rich scranton sent me he's writing some software for this guy who's part of the uh low ball he's got this thing called the global [noise] or something or other network and it's a multi level marketing um internet service provider kind of thing <unk> kind of weird but so i might get onto the net that way and um [noise] you know i'll let you know says that address becomes available <unk> there's also supposedly you know a magazine listing all over the internet service providers here in denver which i need to still look over <unk> <unk> what those um cost uh generally <unk> runs about yeah i've heard of things as low as twenty dollars a month actually there's this one place the bulletin board which allows a there i guess trying to attract new people so it's like twenty five dollars for the first year but in general i think syria's um access providers generally charge about twenty dollars a month and the <unk> can go up from their depending on how much volume you expect to be using uh last year it was like seventy five dollars for a slip account which is like this like you know dedicated a line between your computer and there is um now there's i think the prices down down about forty dollars a month so i still need more looking they're all just and you know a here say <unk> <unk> and the only ones that you had <unk> electronic news service through your computer yeah i used to have um scenic which is um santa cruz operations version of unix installed i'm like really sick and um it has you know then <unk> read <unk> figured it back to adopt machine we use it or um you know <unk> you know doing kind of low level a development type thing about <unk> what was the other thing you said <unk> problem programming eat <unk> yeah <unk> there's <unk> reasonable program <unk> only memory does not modify herbal unless you use a higher voltage hence the term to burn a chip you you have the you have a programmer which has a special socket you drop the chip into and you than it than raises the voltage dropped about well depending on the ship anywhere from twelve to twenty five <unk> normal operating voltage is it five old though at the higher voltage yet uh i forget the exact physics of it but you end up i'm kinda like and that just got you know you've you've you've you've you burn zeros and do it it starts out being all one and then you <unk> zero and you say <unk> you use ultra violet light so i'm just lodge electrons and then you know your races it back to one and then there's also electrical erase civil issues is another voltage <unk> charge <unk> the the mentally location so it's kind of a you know it takes about depending on the chip you know and the strength of eraser anywhere from five to twenty minutes erase it you know and then you've got to download program to the programmer and then it burns it and so you know the whole thing and take you know the time <unk> but it's uh you know it's a good way to make changes the system just miss coughing on a show mhm and um you know somebody's gotta knee problem programmer we've got a programmer for you know micro controllers which also have <unk> in um that kinda thing <unk> another thing we use it for as a like a bloody and downloading programs from the age <unk> she said graphic calculator chemical it's good we uh you know it's it's cheaper to buy a an h. p. and to program it than it is to buy a l._c._d. screen and and then uh assemble all of a circus three required to drive that so for any kind of a system where you need to just like a little user interface you know like if he's had a screen was a few lines of taxes on it uh it's just more economical mhm and uh so that's another thing we use it for us you know like boating downloading programs from from the house later <unk> mean i'm <unk> i'm looking for now there's some kind of a typewriter <unk> <unk> maybe <unk> can tape and document and then i'm applying to computer or even just saying that to a desk typewriters that um yeah they had in my experience with them is that they're awfully non standard <unk> um you may be better off finding a cheap laptop you know i use my or find a use two eighty six or use really sick laptop <unk> again yeah how much <unk> <unk> oh you should be able to get it i would guess you could probably get one for like five hundred <unk> and and some of these uh affordable typewriters are going to cost as much you know mhm and then not be standard right <unk> yeah i was hoping i could get something for two hundred <unk> sounds like they might not be anything there are things and you just you really have to like keep your eye open like maybe go and buy a copy a computer shop or you know and then <unk> it's like you're gonna spend all day like you know saturday morning <unk> by computer shop for and then you spend the rest of the day flipping through you know you know it's like an inch and a half sick you know it's just over size it's this gargantuan you know things for nothing but as you know and they they still use equipment they've got a fairly comprehend set of indexes nowadays <unk> pretty easy to track down like it'll give you a list of all the use hardware vendors and then you just kind of look at each one of them and you know have a pet a paper ready so you can take notes and you probably wanna little you know had posted seeking tear often make little book smart than <unk> than you've got to go on call 'em all so i mean you're going to take a while you really want you know you're you're gonna spend any time you don't spend any money <unk> but you know it is possible to find good deals another choices like i'm missing dot for sale on the using that using that news but you know that's another option and then of course every so often you know someone wants done a lot of computers either sunday or i mean i'm this girl i was seeing for very briefly carmen ended up buying a mac perform for like five hundred and fifty bucks which was a good deal you know she got um you know a a sixty eight thirty processor and uh <unk> you know it's like no actually it was like a hundred and twenty meg hard drive and software you know all you know and i'm back so it sounds pretty good yeah i thought that was a good deal for her yeah [laughter] and it had all the software she wanted you know had a little bit of a spreadsheet and had a you know simple database word processor and she was all said you know she was able to do is very very well set up the kinds of things you know well maybe i can look for something like that there's um monthly computer fair <unk> yeah they <unk> they usually have some good bargains yeah i should probably just go to that and eventually it'll probably be my top <unk> actually the <unk> are you just have one of your friends you know knock himself off and you know get all that stuff [laughter] oh no [laughter] [laughter] oh yeah you know there's there's the suitable period forgiving has passed now i'm allowed to tell jokes <unk> yeah so yeah no well back the gas gas is putting out a web page for his company w. f. t. and he's you know he he it's very um he's very <unk> like all about it i'm i'm not sure if he expects to really get any business doing it or not but it's you know you know there's like pictures of everyone has a picture of me and i've got this you know expression on my like my niece clients and you know my eyes open really why <unk> think of another guy was you know like face almost up into the camera and hung out and you know different people in different poses and got it got like took his picture into the into uh the like the video paint 'em application and then this wizard got to have to have them then underneath each one is like you know it's like <unk> you know and it doesn't you know mood swings <unk> shoes fire <unk> watch the walls in black attends rockies games join yamaguchi high i._q. amish and then he's got this little drawing of a bunch of got in a shape of a you know looks like a pile of something that says rob mccall and underneath and says attempts say on what is it santa monica attends say on says oh my so what what businesses that um well he's got a freelance um engineering company called w._h._a._t. electronic systems w. f. t. yeah stands for we'd fix things to a good name and so you know he's basically a contractor and everyone who works with him as a contractor right [laughter] interesting so are you are making ends meet well i'm kind of hanging in there um i have a couple uh a delays in my latest project which are making me wonder how i'm going to a whole the money together pay rent and that kinda thing huh pay rent and no no well i'm sure i'm sure i'll have a while i'm intending to have it done before the end of the month so that they pay me they paid me half upfront and half on delivery so i'm i'm <unk> we'll see i mean that's one of the parts that got sent to me doesn't do what the they said it would you know so i have to they're saying i have to wait two weeks to get a you know a different part that will work mhm <unk> this point i'm inclined to start looking around for another supplier <unk> and um you know it it it's gonna be kind of a close call because you know living expenses don't stop and so the project gets delayed you know at the start you know spending some of the money you just you know keeping alive and uh so it's going to be close shave but i think i'll be able to get sued by virtue of i've got one robs clients has now uh uh gone to me for business <unk> um so you're doing consulting on your own and that's <unk> yeah right now <unk> doesn't have any projects he's trying to put together a product that basically a multiple uh addresses on a single are two thirty two line which uh you know if you're familiar with the <unk> part of an i._b._m. i'm ordinarily can plug one thing into a calm port and using this device that were coming up with it'll <unk> be possible to have multiple devices on a single come for <unk> and uh so you know we're in the process of verifying with him attic and producing these boards and then uh you know i requested that we review the protocol i want to make sure that there's a couple of different methods where sending data to make it you know fairly versatile and uh you know it should come in it's it's kind of like you know on the the apple macintosh the desktop a has a the desktop what bus bus oh huh you have uh things like you know the mouse attract ball a keyboard extra keypad you know you can plug all kinds of little things into that into the you know they have this special plug shaped worked with the maxine keyboard plug in and <unk> you can have up to sixteen devices running on the apple desktop but <unk> and so you know we were just looking for produce a similar kind of a situation using uh you know they are two thirty to calm port a i._b._m. <unk> so mhm but that one's not you know that's kinda like you know we have to start marketing it and we want you know we'll probably be a little while before we actually start realizing any kind of a you know income yeah <unk> revenue from that sort <unk> you know so it's it's um it'll be a little bit of work <unk> <unk> meanwhile it's not stopping me i i've got together with a few people and said that you know i was interested in living in an intentional community and so we're actually looking at i'm buying some place and uh you know having enough room for people plus a little extra room and uh you know having a a community in which we explore states of consciousness and various disciplines like meditation or <unk> or um yoga contra mhm so did i mentioned before yeah yes and that was just the thing i wanted to ask you about next <unk> how's that going and um i think i had mentioned to you that i'm jan does <unk> talk to them about something like that and um with some of her friends i'm not <unk> maybe not <unk> such emphasis on a um you know it's blowing a mental state and that kinda thing um although that you know would probably be a part of the spiritual and the community uh-huh yeah i was wondering um where uh would you where are you planning on doing this and <unk> are there are quite a few or five or six and we got we got for people who are committed to it and and there was another person who uh you know express some interest initially and then kind of backed off and she's decided that she's kind of attached to her apartment and and you know yeah you know having your own space and and she's got she teaches voice lessons and so she's afraid that she'd lose some clientele she moved <unk> and a two which i responded well of course there aren't any students anywhere else in the world but um so you know i don't i don't get that you know she she's she's got you know these barriers in place that will prevent her from doing this <unk> you know and she she could choose to you know eliminate those but you know people who are more invested in uh let's see how do i want to put the most people get wrapped up in their emotions about things and that generally keeps them like stuck where they are <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> it's it seems to be the emotions behind something i just just my own take on it you know i mean i know that like in their linguistic programming there was a focus on the believe but i think that um um the police you know beliefs are just thought that it's the fact that you i guess have some emotional company man that i think that's generally what keeps keeps <unk> place <unk> um which is kind of um you know the root for believe is the same as the root for love and so i think that i think that kind of telling i mean i don't i don't know you know people nowadays probably don't necessarily attach the two words but you can see that you know it's like they hold some you know they hold some opinion you know as if it were the truth and uh you know and <unk> prevalent ones seems to be like the like the supremacy of emotion like whatever i'm feeling must be the way things really are you know kind of like a trust your got kind of thing mhm and that um you know like whatever emotions or feelings they have about something will determine how they act about it mhm which can be quite frustrating for other people <unk> know i'm the only way i mean i guess it's it's i mean i i suppose i shouldn't care it's just that but i guess i have a believe myself which is that um you know it's i think that most people kind of get the cart before the horse you know they decided to go for these mystical approaches to life or whatever and they or their needs philosophy you know something like greater than um and i know that the <unk> that people think that that uh you know like part of the step down the road to recovery say the last thing against something like <unk> i'm sorry i didn't catch the you said something about it's something like <unk> <unk> greg and i wasn't sure what you said it was before you were talking about the <unk> i'm just trying to find oh what did i say for short term memory something like something isn't <unk> just you know the i don't know just you know like a belief in something you know hire outside of oneself mhm <unk> <unk> yeah maybe i know i said that earlier yeah um yeah so anyway and usually people offer them it seems like it's useful to have some kind of a structure because they don't seem to be able to hold anything in place for themselves uh-huh and it seems that uh you know so they moved from a position of you know disarray into some order but you can get just as fixed and hung up on systems as you can on your whims yeah in either case you end up with these you know like passionate feelings about well about reality ultimately like what you should do you know people get all i'm just thinking of like a friend of mine michael and and he he was seeing this girl that they were lovers back quite a while i think back in high school and then they kind of like sort of had a reunion or you know they kind of ran into each other and this is michael pica yeah uh-huh and they were going out and seeing each other for a while but she's kind of got this thing about you know this you know she's got the sensitivity thing it's hard to i don't know if there's like a specific name for it but it's kind of like you know it's kind of like she's got you know like these sensitive emotions you know and um you know she can't bear to have 'em i'm infringed upon <unk> and so it's like whatever um but you know it's like <unk> or whatever you know gives her bad feelings you know she like students clear instead of you know <unk> organizing herself to be powerful in a situation <unk> <unk> um she lets her you know she's just like these emotions kind of like be the ultimate test of reality and since they're bad <unk> bad feelings then you know her her reaction is to sort of withdraw from the situation you know you know it's just it's just the same kind of thing it's like people get invested in you know comfort and uh you know keeps them you know get them so far maybe but generally get them like where they are and then that's as far as they've gone you know <unk> be no more development because they're more interested in their comfort mhm so it just kinda for some reason irritates me yeah well you do you are <unk> you know <unk> seems like you play some pretty high value on flexibility and um and development continue <unk> think that's something i value i guess it's kinda like disappointment because it's like you know you're going along and then they just like drop out like i don't want to play anymore you know it's kind of like a disappointment like they'd rather have their emotions you know then you know some kind of related nuts <unk> so i find that disappointing <unk> anyway <unk> well so you were saying that there's five of you together and then well one of the five is this girl who is uh i guess pretty much decided to stay in our own apartment <unk> there's four of us for accounting you yeah mhm um and we're

<unk> <unk> so you didn't get my answer to back i answer you back <unk> type <unk> i read you miss him <unk> oh great she says something totally opposite of what the other friends is that what am i going [laughter] so i just wrote this long drawn out thing on on the net and learning about all the different versions of every rule that you ever hear about 'em i got kind of personality that 'cause i always like start off you know and he's into <unk> and then <unk> end up like talking about myself and like you know because i know people are wondering why does she want to know how you make <unk> upper prayer and you know they didn't have as everybody yeah but some people are just like kick that you know you're not supposed to ask stuff like that you know like what dalia will post on the net and that some people are freaking out all of that and i think that's perfectly natural to want to know know stuff like that yeah i mean that was the purpose of this and that yeah but some people like um i don't know if you are on um last year when i'm jemilla no i just started yeah there was a big thing um last year and i i myself off because i didn't want to deal with it just um sister she wrote about uh this <unk> cookie dough thing you know what are those like sexually perverted kind of joke <unk> postings things and so everyone was so offended and and like you know a lot of people are getting back and forth they got really petty and it happens a lot you know it happens a lot stuff that you know taken out of context and people get offended and stuff <unk> and plus because you've got your dealing with so many different completely different kinds of people i didn't really realize that though i thought it was i was a really diverse network i didn't know there were so many people who some people were getting mad at w. last me oppose people are like you know i mean not today's [laughter] no not today but before yeah yeah yeah you know i'm supposed <unk> next week really she lives in michigan know she doesn't chicago oh i'm up to chicago because there's um the soupy conference i'm and i'm i'm going to stay with her it's oh that's great i can't wait [laughter] should i have not left my well i mean i was in germany for one year and then i came back from germany last fall mhm and then i have not been anywhere except for my house in schools since then <unk> like the road in between [laughter] [laughter] that's good so how long is the <unk> and it's just for one day and <unk> free that's the best thing about it frees yeah wow yeah you just have to find the means to get there right yeah i wouldn't trade and <unk> so you're still going to go it's mass yeah one too into i mean robin already like paid for everything side too bad if i don't go i think he's kinda kinda me to go to so yeah i'm just gonna go i have to find a way to get there <unk> <unk> and it's really not really yeah it's coming out <unk> because i don't think i'll take a plane there but i don't know bus or a train or something ah because i know that i mean if you got here you could probably ride with robin yeah i was thinking that too but i hadn't seen just come here yeah how 'bout like she said she was driving alone so i wouldn't mind like i said sooner you not come there and then yeah and that long enough <unk> i mean if she driving there by herself yeah yeah because because i don't i mean i think she's okay right now but it would be much better she didn't have drive by herself yeah i think so too i i think that's you know i want to do that but i think she doesn't want me to go through all that trouble i totally it's no big deal i can take the bus on the train there and then we could drive them together you know yeah i think that would be nice i mean just <unk> and also just 'cause it's nice to go like if you're going to a big place that to go along because who knows how hard it will be to find somebody right and i'll be alone i don't know anything yeah he's been there before like two the conference but i don't know she's into <unk> <unk> ohio right yeah <unk> yeah and also i'm kinda worried about her 'cause like i don't know if she talked about her house yeah she has yeah yeah yeah 'cause there's i mean like <unk> like last <unk> few weeks ago she was like losing control over hands and i'm now she's on some kind of medication that's like put it back like she can use their hands again mhm but she's like she had to have her hand bandaged up and stuff and like she was having a real hard time at work so that would make me nervous like she was going to drive by herself you know what happened you know to go wrong with their hands and she can't drive but i guess she's <unk> she's taking some medication now so i guess okay but yeah i tried calling her tonight but i got <unk> soon <unk> she called them back i'll tell her that's what i do because i was thinking about that too but you see like throws it off make it seems like it's no big deal so and i think oh right on his heart that you'd prefer her company or something and then i'll be like you know she doesn't want to put you out for 'em you know inconvenience but if you make it sound like you what to do it and she'll probably agree yeah see you still not thinking of going i know i think that <unk> yeah i mean because even before all that weird stuff he's been talking about i've always had a kind of weird feeling about them anyway the <unk> i mean the whole organization just 'cause it seems kinda strange like um i don't know it's hard to explain but just real i'm not i don't want <unk> today and she said it was the <unk> yeah she say you know we should go to a conference you know as a group because i've been living with like four or five sisters aswa you went to the place yeah and so she said i'm <unk> it'll be nice to go to a conference where they have to be all females because he has uh some of them are meat markets so i mean i i've had really yeah no that <unk> think all that but it's kind of true a lot of people like eligible women right [laughter] in one place but uh no i don't know <unk> if i hate the experience and i'll never go to another one but it's kind of thought to be okay then <unk> you know it's okay yeah i mean i've heard that it's like <unk> i mean that <unk> that it is enjoyable you know people talk about you know religious things and get really into it and stuff yeah i guess that's what i had heard bad about it was just that they were so into talking about like um the crowd and stuff but they but they weren't using this as being like a tool for social change at all like they weren't talking about what we could possibly do and muslim to like improve the world but rather just well spend all your time praying kind of philosophy <unk> and i'm finding people and that's it huh uh-huh i said nine thousand people and that's all they taught and that's a big fine tune with that you know they have like a a a large group of people they can really make a difference but they i don't know i haven't been to one so yeah yeah i haven't been to either so i can't really talk <unk> but i think that they just don't want to get really radical right for whatever i mean 'cause i guess like saudi arabia funds it a lot and ah yeah <unk> they were talking about the <unk> going on as long as that the person's name <unk> i mean i've never heard of like this person and i never think he's <unk> he's a minor and stuff like that mhm and then there's the mike tyson thing that a lot of that stuff <unk> you know happy about that <unk> would be interesting to see what he has to say [laughter] you're my post like whatever what about him stuff that you were talking about his girlfriend or something you know i can't even kiss my girlfriend then i was like are you doing your girlfriend what is that so it's like he doesn't really know i don't know he i mean that's that he doesn't even have the basics down you know i i think i'm like you were <unk> the beginning stage i can i have the basics down and that's it but he doesn't even have that like i i mean before i can read that there was no like girlfriend boyfriend thing and <unk> <unk> and all that stuff no pork any of that stuff but he's just <unk> yeah yeah i mean he doesn't have control over his <unk> but i think and so you know when people rag on him i i i tend to take the like the side of yeah like mike tyson because he really doesn't know me neither way he's dead but it's it's not all <unk> you know other people control him and tell them what to do and where to spend money and stuff like that yeah i mean i generally stay away from the t._v. anyway <unk> i never know about i remember when people talk about [laughter] and um so um i forgot what you <unk> you're a grad student right no actually i'm a eternal bachelor's students you know what a bachelors or undergrad oh really yeah <unk> yeah you get 'em [laughter] i think this is my fifth year [laughter] oh really oh that's not bad how's your fifth year i'm alan view one next year <unk> it's going to get to that point [laughter] i can't finish my majoring in two years i'm going to need three because my first year that i can't tell you what i do those so it's like i'm in saint louis so what do you er you've already <unk> alright what you've already graduated right no see i'm working on like three degrees at one time so it's gonna be another three years before i graduate unless i just decided to give up and just take what i've got so what do you have so far or if i could graduate with the german degree right now mhm but german degree as useless right unless you get a p._h._d. or something mhm so i'm also work in an english degree because that's my real interest <unk> he really english literature not like literature right yeah well what i really really love is like medieval stuff oh and that's what i really think that like <unk> english and german goes together really well if you're interested in medieval because i'm in the past english and german used to be the same language like about the year before the year seven hundred wow you know 'cause like in europe it was all like wandering pagan tribes and they just like um they can't you know they came down the guy and all them mhm like they used to i mean they spoke germanic language and some of them settled in germany some people kept walking and kept on going to england and so the language gradually changed after that <unk> <unk> but um yeah you like um like the <unk> you know you hear the term anglo saxon is like that's the tribes i guess [laughter] i didn't know that well that sounds neat what's the other one oh and and the i guess like when i'm also starting to do is um i want to get an education degree so that i can actually get a job [laughter] yeah into the teaching thing yeah <unk> <unk> what are you doing <unk> forgot oh i'm going <unk> i i'm just starting so like what what is it people always ask me bio geology biology combined major and ah it sounds really exciting i guess when i get to those i have the science classes this fall and like i'm taking arabic too and i want a minor in arabic oh that'd be a good idea yeah i like to do that it's a bit now i've already like if i was gonna minor and something it has to be italian because i've already like taking a bunch of those classes oh i see but i i'm i'm at the mosque near my house sometimes they go they teach arabic sometimes so i learned the alphabet yeah that's pretty much <unk> took a a conversational like uh colloquial arabic that because i i i really wanted to go to egypt but i won't have time because i need to like since the comments from my major and i was thinking of i'm <unk> <unk> have you ever heard of take five like propose a lot closer study and and they're fun the year for you <unk> they have that the school and so i went into that and um [noise] do ninth grade because i put in the back burner because i i just i'm really want to be

don't have the you know i don't have a huge vocabulary yeah but i can understand it so i said you know you had like halfway there was <unk> spanish why don't you go ahead so i wonder if all those things you have to go to the place learn it really yeah and like how about spanish speaking signs right yeah i mean 'cause i know i mean we're both like there's one school in damascus if you ever wanted to study arabic and it's really cheap i mean it's i mean you get lodging and everything including the price <unk> uh i'm not yet i forgot what the name of the schools but it sounded like famous international school and like for american dollars it's like really cheap and also if you wanted to learn spanish like there's really good schools in guatemala that are really cheap to like my friend was i'm travelling around there and she just learned spanish did you study abroad um in germany last year mhm yeah <unk> yeah it was for a year wow it's kind <unk> that's where you're from my you said you were born <unk> doesn't right now <unk> now i'm wow yeah so now <unk> negative <unk> how did you like find islam snack really weird you find someone <unk> them and <unk> sent my pen pals huh i had

so we we don't we don't hang out like every day but um i like maybe ten minutes or something huh maybe you could give it to come to michigan i could see fondly right [laughter] yeah what would it be like a probably august thirty first or something since the conferences on the first of september uh-huh oh i think i'll be here when does the confines when does this week <unk> <unk> it is on the twenty six oh but i'll be back in the afternoon yeah wow so how many siblings do you have you have one brother one sister and i have a foster sister she's married you have a what a foster sister she's

today's ah he went back uh he went back to columbia she got married to an american so they're living here oh candles her husband's birthday today <unk> went over there but um yeah so how did you um discovered um i don't know i think i'm still discovering by wrote that like i can but it's just because i mean not just because i mean i was really interested in it and um i lived it unless i'm my sophomore year doing and um i don't know i was always <unk> fascinated now that i look back on my my my freshman year i'm one of the girls i'm here <unk> the <unk> right <unk> and <unk> out you know i'm a freshman i don't know anything i mean the and at that point i was like really really into feminism and stuff <unk> and um she comes in class and he has this <unk> and it's like she doesn't where it was it so like i mean how face shows but <unk> it's the the the <unk> all the way like down to her eyes and <unk> says like she was it and her facials but just the minimum you know uh-huh and so i'm i'm <unk> i'm like oh my god this is paul press the girl [laughter] you know the first thing i thought and that it's like funny now looking back that i became like you know a muslim and and back then i was thinking oh my god <unk> those long close odds he must be so hot [laughter] and then i turned around and i did it but yeah so i lived with this um you know my roommate and you know just <unk> of course she when i'm <unk> i'm <unk> and stuff and just her behavior and <unk> said something with <unk> with the flu <unk> may well she's not seen grace nafta what she said and she said you know <unk> you said this number for you know i'm <unk> and drink and stuff like that it's just and then there was this another person in my school who and they both was <unk> not you know the way uh not have <unk> job but just because <unk> you know mhm one was <unk> money than and um this one is african american and it is a seeing them and how they even though they weren't like very conservative muslim they're still modest and they still cover the you know they're you know you never saw them like if they they interacting with guys and everything but they covered everything and stuff and then i got interested and so then i said you know i don't know that much to me she said she's my son but like she grew up he was born into it so it wasn't really like she could and the next town point of view telling me you know this is this and that that yeah isn't it strange because i had like when <unk> when i had a pen pal from algeria that moved here and it was so funny because i knew more about it's under heated yeah then i didn't know that <unk> yeah 'cause i like third you realize that you're named after <unk> he's like are you [laughter] uh [laughter] pretty basic <unk> isn't <unk> yeah [laughter] yeah that's how it wasn't as her like she said she <unk> she'd been praying a okay she praying and i've been <unk> january matt so if i didn't know what that meant wow yeah so you know really what are what are you wonder what you're saying [laughter] i know i i i remember as a couple of years and i i i forget <unk> english like when i'm <unk> i'm really english and the chances are rated text but i always forget what it means in english and i have to go back and say oh yeah okay this is a really good <unk> <unk> you know but what i'm saying i'm in my prayer that as you know remember either so like you know said it was then i i'm one of the girls <unk> see more than <unk> she was very conservative and i learned from her the conservative aspect of islam you know so like everything else to me now it's like <unk> i don't i don't wear veil and address american but i'm just like when i see things i'm like <unk> gosh <unk> that's good as and stuff like that you know yeah so and then <unk> while if i was you know still living with my roommate <unk> nothing really bothered him since i got you got the <unk> going on you have it on you know i don't care i won't <unk> but that's okay with you yeah [noise] yeah i mean i know for like i mean for me personally because you know before i became alice i'm like i was in whatever i wanted a lot of ways i would like like <unk> if i if i were you know where <unk> where the scarves now and stuff it's like keep myself from doing those things again <unk> you know or even to protect other people from <unk> or like myself <unk> <unk> yeah i do yeah i've been wearing it for one year wow well i mean what i'm <unk> like when i first had already been actually before um you know i'd <unk> you know but just behind my back you know mhm but that was also because i was working at um a palestinian restaurant yeah and like you had to cover your hair otherwise you'd come home smelling like <unk> like really bad <unk> so so and plus my boss is like happy if i were <unk> so so it that's how i started doing it but then when i got to germany um i started you know we're in jobs and and and there are there a lot of <unk> there's a lotta turkish people <unk> i mean the germans or not i mean there's there's a few germans who are muslim but most of them are either married to um foreigners or there's disease <unk> <unk> what is exactly that i don't know what that <unk> <unk> it's like a certain it's i wouldn't say it's like a school 'cause they follow different like some of the most yeah some of them are to me it's not really based upon that but it's like um they they do everything that the muslims do and then they also do extra things like meditation sort of exercises um and like chanting in a group and i'm like changing the names of online and stuff like that <unk> kind of like a certain approach <unk> um because whenever <unk> hear about that they said you know you might get confused you might want to be as soon see and stuff like that they don't really have a positive yeah most people have a really bad attitude about it but i think um mostly ignorance but also um i mean because i mean they are definitely in some way like i'm not going to put say everyone but i mean they do definitely do something differently like for instance um when they have the chance circles all have men and women in the same room like they'll they'll have like a man circle and a woman circle but there won't be a current in between them <unk> you know so some muslims would be like whoa that's not modest but that's just the way they do it you know and like i feel totally comfortable there especially you know because i personally don't feel that comfortable like praying behind the wall and not even able to see the mom or something you know oh maybe that's what that's how it is a must do they're not wanna win state but like it the one near my house when women going to separate room and we have to like if there is a a sermon or whatever or goodbye then we got to listen to it through like a lot bigger than the other room and and mine is i kinda like it you know <unk> they're they're downstairs so we can see the <unk> the <unk> <unk> they turn around and you know that's like whoa you know what are you doing right so i mean it's kinda nice <unk> see the <unk> in mom and everything and <unk> just elevated so the they can't see ask <unk> stand up and look up you know write his like total this suspect so it kinda works out for us yeah that's how it is that the one <unk> [noise] <unk> yeah i like it that way it's a good in summer it's hot or [laughter] some <unk> are you um you're twenty four right and your siblings close <unk> your age or are they just like he's <unk> sister or something like that my sister's seventeen oh about college and my brother is plenty [laughter] so i she's going to the same schools you know gotta wisconsin wisconsin's yeah wow um it's called north land <unk> and

going <unk> or the younger no [laughter] they're like so old it's unbelievable <unk> my my sister's fifteen years older than i am my mother's ten years older than i am wow so sending myself <unk> must
