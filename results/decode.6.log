a local restaurant no we went to um we just had um like appetizers and stuff <unk> department oh and then we just went to the bar that's downstairs and that's it i mean and go out to dinner [noise] oh okay um it's it's a wedding that you're going to i'm not no i'm not going to it oh oh you're just going to the party yeah uh-huh yeah oh [noise] so um how's everything good mhm [noise] well that's good i was just talking to <unk> yeah and um [noise] uh she had called me yesterday right and so i was um you know i just wanted to touch base when she called i i wasn't home and she didn't know <unk> where you know when where i would be and this and that so i says no <unk> october second so mhm i'm so she said fine i'm now she knows <unk> but um [noise] uh what did <unk> oh yeah eventually she wants to call you or my <unk> ask would gym's number is you know that a gym um pittsburgh yeah oh yeah yeah because it's getting cold so she you know she wants she wants to see pittsburgh she wants to do it before the mhm before the cold weather comes <unk> oh okay so how was work good that's fine yeah yeah <unk> anything new changing or anything no yeah no it's the same old thing well what's up with you i'm ah winding down um you know they um we're starting the transition i you know till the students that they were going to you know what the new plan was and um they're not that thrilled about it but i want i mean i'm at your leaving that i'm leaving that they're going to have to go into another class that's already going <unk> and i'm a you know with a lot of other people <unk> and so they're not happy about that so um but anyway uh you know that's they don't have any choice <unk> that's the way the program is gonna be and they had a cake for me yesterday <unk> i thought that was nice <unk> sign the card and the whole thing mhm and um so i got a i've got one more week mhm and that's it so i'm really a kind of excited about you know about finishing <unk> finishing up and going down there <unk> and i want to um i think you should move down there [noise] um [noise] i was thinking about it if you're paying this woman money plus you're paying rent yeah it would be worth it to get an apartment down there you're paying the same yeah i <unk> that would be that would be much easier um the um the the only problem is that the the rent there are a really really high and you look so i mean i don't think they're i don't i know there are higher they're probably a little bit higher than what you're paying now but if you're paying that woman money just stay there and you're paying you know your rent i'm sure you could find an apartment for the same amount of money yeah i want to be right in the town uh right in the city where i'm working one day <unk> <unk> well it's nice i mean it it's a good place but just to cut down on the on the commuting uh because if i am and i'm in the right place i'd only be like two or three miles from the job <unk> would i would light ideally that's what i would like <unk> um i when i when i start there's there's somebody down there that's dealing that that has <unk> into real estate and i'm going to ask but i've been reading the paper and um [noise] the um you know they they want like close to a thousand dollars <unk> though uh everything i noticed as a you know you go the grocery store you go to the gas station you know is a lot higher <unk> and i'm uh at least um what i was doing like for the summers i was coming up and never buying gas down there but getting it here or if i went to long island i'd get it there where it's it's cheaper and um and then i would um you know load up on my groceries and they sing i was going to have bring down there so i kind of avoided that way mhm but um you know i i that would be a whole lot easier but then i don't know whenever i would get to see you and mike i'm i wouldn't be a lot closer to right <unk> <unk> and that part i'd like but uh like for any you know any occasions anything um you know i uh i don't know uh yeah i i just got the feeling that ah that you would probably come up to this area but not where i am is you know is often so i <unk> i don't know about that i mean yeah i guess you know have more friends and stuff there yeah and <unk> but you know so i and then of course when <unk> comes home like and she'll be a coming home at thanksgiving uh-huh and every but he's going to be congregate in up here so you know it's um it's a tough decision but then i as i was saying on the on the other hand [noise] as soon as the number <unk> a little bit ridiculous though just staying and you know one place for <unk> you know for an occasion for thanksgiving that comes around once a year <unk> you know i mean i don't know yeah i yeah i know it so i i've i uh i i'm stuck here at least through ah through august because of because of leads but even even at that i'm i'm not i'm stuck here but i'm tied in but i'm not if i wanted to leave i could do that um i could just wait until somebody comes in and once the place and so i wouldn't be pressed ago <unk> and then the other option that i was thinking of was after the um ah after the cars paid off to go uh move my stuff into big men and use that as a primary residence but yet but then like rent a room down there in the town i'm i'm working and so at least what i'll be paying is i'm a real would which would be a lot cheaper and and um i would be i i would be just adding to the time that i you know have to have residency before that thing so if it ever <unk> so [noise] um you know but it's only three years i mean yeah yeah yeah you have to be there three out of the last five years before selling or something like that and uh hopefully <unk> then we'll stay off my back as far as having ranchers they don't want that <unk> they want they want a damn owner occupied <unk> and uh so i'm kind of ah ah you know kinda <unk> for now and they i told them a couple of years ago that as soon as i uh found a job in that area <unk> then i would come in there which you know really was <unk> was my intentions so i'm just trying to have to see how things go down here and <unk> and stuff but [noise] [noise] well whatever i mean it's your commute [noise] yeah yeah oh well that's it i'm i know i already i'm going to go down there on a on a second i'm gonna stay with her on the second and i'm on the third um the next day i'm coming back here because then we have the um that jewish holiday off in the middle <unk> week mhm do you get any you don't get any of those <unk> <unk> do you know so [noise] um yeah it's it's a it's a tough situation <unk> the the size of the place that i have here mhm i'm you know with that with that triple dresser boy uh <unk> not too many places can accommodate mhm so how is your apartment that's fine oh you said that was so enthusiastic <unk> uh-huh i know i you know you're you're kind of tolerating it and i yeah exactly i mean for the next couple of years we've put so much work into it and you know <unk> i don't know that it's like <unk> was it so much time and work and moving things and then it's like you know i don't i'm not going to move but i don't totally love it here yeah yeah yeah did you um talked to paid about the windows um no actually it and he came up here and the other day uh-huh and uh [noise] i don't know it's like trying to show him i mean i might talk to them about the windows but i was trying to show him like all the work that we did in the kitchen and everything <unk> because he hadn't seen it and it totally like went over his head i'm like oh look <unk> unlike look at the kevin foot and everything and he goes oh he goes oh this hole in the floor i was like a a a whole <unk> <unk> and he's like i think i know how it affects us and i was like [noise] it just doesn't get it so hard to communicate with him does he have um i know he's the owner does he have like a wife or other people that live with him and his wife is paralyzed in a wheelchair and had two strokes and it's like practically dead she's like a vegetable oh and she has like um i dunno nurses come in every morning and like clean up and whatnot and take care of her okay because when <unk> when i came near um as we are going up the stairs and down the stairs i did see a wheelchair and <unk> and i knew that <unk> and so i was way and then somebody answered the door that was definitely not italian so um i wonder who that was oh they have different i mean i see different nurses here okay like it's probably an agency or a service if they work with the whole health <unk> somebody different everyday right like that so it's like a home healthy <unk> exactly yeah that's <unk> oh so in other words she can't it's not like you could explain to her and then she can tell him oh i oh i see yeah oh boy [laughter] yeah that is frustrating trying to get through to somebody who you know who's on another and another level or whatever right it's like it's not i mean the communicating as hard like just because of the language and stuff but it's not just that though it's like um i don't know it's not just that it's like he just doesn't understand you know what i mean like i don't know did you see on the painted walls oh yeah i know the laws are painted i mean it's easy enough you just walk in there not around anymore yeah but he didn't comment on it no wow <unk> he didn't want us to do and actually oh really yeah we had to really um sisters aren't available to do it because he wanted to keep it brown that way he would never have to repaint you know [noise] oh wow oh boy well so <unk> but the uh the cabinets and stuff in that um and the counter i mean those are [noise] you know those are definite improvement and i'm going home rent that so it just because of that though i mean we can't um i don't know i don't want to leave but it's like i don't love the apartment <unk> so um other yeah okay 'cause you're squashed

really excellent is really excellent that's cool yes most fun i've had a long time [laughter] good effect is excellent [noise] well i'm taking a class in um physical anthropology i applied here's the whole story this is a first let me give you the whole rundown of white and call you earlier in case your family but i i didn't have your phone number <unk> yeah how did you get it why cause your family <unk> they had [laughter] and they have it yeah and then <unk> bend a father and sister came for a few days mhm um and so i couldn't really stay up late and call and i couldn't get up early and call mhm mhm yeah <unk> teen and you know rachel sleeping on the couch downstairs and [laughter] and then and then i couldn't find your number and then this whole thing with the classes happened <unk> and then i couldn't get up in the morning because i knew that you were on doing classes and stuff and like you would get up and go to work in the morning so i couldn't call you at night i would have to get up early and call you and ice cream [laughter] and then this whole thing in the class like i applied for the graduate level <unk> and i went when i talk to you know like what <unk> what are you looking for and they said basically what we're looking for is that you don't embarrass <unk> <unk> you know you don't embarrass right so i was a guy who were you talking to a to the it's like the college of general studies uh-huh it's like sort of the night school and they had this program where you can take for graduate courses uh-huh and pay like the reduced price in my case i don't pay anything <unk> <unk> the benefits and um and then if you enroll in the program it's there so you know and it's like <unk> <unk> it can it serves for graduate school like a stepping stone to get into the program <unk> you know that you don't have <unk> it's not as rigorous application process and all that <unk> mhm mhm right so you don't embarrass <unk> and then they were like what's your grade point average i told him they were like well that sounds about like what you're looking for <unk> iraq there is no excuse my but then i get this letter we're sorry you have not been accepted to the graduate level happening that the for the undergraduate at like i was devastated devastated sorry honey yeah well it's been went and i was like i wanted to work and i'm like [laughter] work and i'm one of my coworkers was like look <unk> what <unk> what probably happen if they didn't like the classes that you had and they wanted you to have particular classes that they deemed appropriate bingo it's all like cultural anthropology that i don't know physical anthropology know archeology and i went and they went in and i talk to them and they were like <unk> <unk> you know they said that that's what i was like oh meanwhile i'd like <unk> spend like good <unk> life <unk> fucking <unk> never believe that you were such a good spin and i mean even it earlier good student that good stuff going for you <unk> you know it's just like this like after being out of it for a year and it's not something you lose how i feel like [laughter] should be doing great you feel like i'm getting stupid [laughter] they have to like take it out and polish it once in a while yeah date but still <unk> [laughter] [noise] so but i mean like <unk> <unk> <unk> i mean it really hurt oh honey <unk> but i'm fine now 'cause i know that they're just it's just 'cause they're slobs [laughter] well that's what you get living in philadelphia girl [laughter] it's hard to do with philadelphia has to do the university of pennsylvania being an ivy league <unk> exactly exactly you know get for a living in philadelphia <unk> being around ivy league schools man [laughter] they're couple of different places i could live where that would you know that could be it temple which is not an ivy league school <unk> [noise] but do you live in philadelphia so [laughter] i go to bed [laughter] so but that's that's my major story so now you're in the physical anthropology class yeah which is i was kinda like okay it's gonna be really scientific kidding [laughter] we're just gonna like <unk> see how <unk> like buy <unk> these different but really it's really i mean it's a lecture class when she's excellent she's she's so funny okay good and she's a trip she started telling us about how she um she was in graduate school officers doing was eating a snickers bars uh-huh she gets curvy [laughter] just tells me store and she just like she's on a road <unk> pocketed talking all this stuff is coming out she's laughing under so [laughter] i mean some people are kinda like a get it i mean i just think she's so funny like you do certain asleep <unk> before you leave [laughter] really good she's really funny that's awesome and uh she was talking about we're talking about darwin here i'm just rambling on um she's talking about darling and darwinism and then she's talking about the different critique you know and <unk> course religious one and <unk> and the last one was that um [noise] from a geologist said you know when they found different layers of settlement there the fossil record from one layer <unk> next was always completely different like there wasn't any graduate changes mhm from you know like there'll be one type of clam on one level and then the next level it's like um it's the same you know the the the same species but some of the changes are like so drastic like its world will be going clock wise on one level and then on the next level though because then kevin park wise oh wow and there's <unk> and and so it's like hard to explain how the changes could've happened and they there's no time there no i'm levels where there's like the <unk> going clock wise and planes going ten o'clock wise are together at the same time <unk> and all over whenever excuse me whenever they look at sent settlements that's true wow and so it's kinda like <unk> what does that mean in well now they're they're <unk> they're proposing this theory <unk> was you know like this <unk> this critique was made [noise] and um then it just sort of sat on the back shelves you know disappeared for a while and then in the seventies these two guys started looking at it again and they were like okay you know this guy's got a point and they start getting all over again and what they proposed was um what was it called um punctuated equilibrium where you've got <unk> massive genetic mutations happening happening at once and um you know like if you if they say that if you look at a species that means <unk> like they're hot spots on the genes where they maintain mhm you mean like things don't happen overnight uh i mean things don't happen <unk> they happen in specific spaces okay jeans okay <unk> <unk> it's not completely random mutation isn't there's it seems to be some sort of pattern to it and that's interesting yeah and she said that you know basically what they're saying if it's not natural selection makes the changes but it's what i'm you know like there'll be mutations and most of them don't work out you know like <unk> i'm either that or a species never like make the past fertilization or whatever you know but every once in a while one comes along and it does work mhm um and it's natural selection keeps it going mhm and it was very interesting i still feel like i'm i'm you know like would like to learn more about it 'cause i'm part of me is like <unk> <unk> <unk> that <unk> can't let go [laughter] part of like you know like look into this trying to figure out find out more about it you know just what it doesn't sound like they're totally against <unk> sounds kind of fine tuning him yeah yeah <unk> <unk> expect not expect that yeah but it was real neat it was so neat to like be introduced to this thing like wow oh yeah different yeah yeah like you know <unk> heard of it it was great like it's like when i first was introduced into linguistics i was like wow yeah like i said i'd never thought of it that way yeah <unk> yeah that's cool i'm envious of you know being in the class <unk> well it sounds to me like you've got your own classroom going on you know <unk> teach and that's not as much fun that one i mean i mean like god the whole country's your classroom you know [laughter] i'd love to get your letters and you're like half full of <unk> can you <unk> thoughts [laughter] great <unk> <unk> yeah well i spend a lotta time alone living alone too you know you're more likely to think deeply when you're like alone than when you're with people all the time yeah it's not that way it was hard to think deeply earl and [laughter] it was more fun to just like go down and make brownies rather than like <unk> think you know i've been getting together though we didn't mess around you know mostly messing around [laughter] it's a really good talks too [laughter] yeah we did yeah i missed that do to to maybe i'm missing <unk> yeah i

what they're yeah they're that's excellent though it's so incredibly beautiful just absolutely beautiful like unspoiled the beautiful you know and the just being under water was just so amazing oh my god it was just like it was so quiet and you're just like completely unfolded and water so it's kind of like this low dream like thing and just the fish are amazing like i just never thought about them being that many or having like lives underneath the water i mean i'm very self centered i'm a land person you know [laughter] and just the amazing amount of kinds of vegetation and stuff like that and i got to see uh we went to this place called the cleaning station which is a place where and they don't know why that like big fish like mental raising 'em napoleon rises and sharks come and they get cleaned up like there's little fish that live there and they'll eat all the parasites off the men are race and the sharks but the nice thing is that they know that for some reason 'cause they'll come to the cleaning station and the sharks will sit there with open miles and let the fish swim into their mouth in through their bills without eating um wow i saw i saw shaq doing that just you know standing straight up with <unk> and all these little fish are like swimming through and i'm like no way [laughter] [laughter] did he get scared at all oh totally the first time when i was near <unk> was like okay [laughter] that's closest else okay let's leave now [laughter] but uh then you kinda get used to because they don't come near you really <unk> and uh then we went on further and then there was a place where they were like two sharks and that was getting kind of nervous 'cause that's trying to watch both at once [laughter] and then we kept going and then there's a place where they were five <unk> [laughter] i was like god so either you had to like completely freaked out or deal with it so i dealt with it [laughter] yeah after that but no it's it's not as scary as i thought it would be you know you feel a lot safer everywhere <unk> i'd i'd be terrified and i've been in i actually haven't had a discussion after watching going to see the movie you know and he's

i'm like really loved that really wants to do it and i was sort of like 'cause like we should do we should do right now it's like you know trying to explain now part of it is really scary to me yeah i'm a problem because some feedback you wouldn't <unk> [laughter] well i mean it is kind of um but it's it's not as scary as you would think it would yeah 'cause you're there and the once you've taken classes and i didn't even get certified i took a resort course that time like two hours you know there's it's a lot of the equipment is like foolproof mhm and that may sound just kind of like nothing

5046-0000000-0001078 [laughter] so okay so let me tell me your deep dark secrets on yeah they're trying to be careful [laughter] where are you i'm good how are you good um first of all another happy birthday and <unk> and <unk> will be coming okay thank you thank you for calling things were so crazy these last week and then i finally got it together to call you and then the pin number had run out of time so i had to wait another week and then last week didn't work and so i had to wait another week and it's <unk> so it goes our time schedules are really pretty terrible yeah it's really awful and and what happens with season which is really stupidest that when i think about calling it's wrong day of course and if you don't get the right day yeah then forget it you know get it because our schedules are absolutely <unk> saw one semester <unk> say oh it'd be really nice to call [laughter] yeah well [laughter] oh well anyway and anyway because otherwise <unk> these past week should be crazy crazy crazy i know jesse tell me so busy you couldn't go see mom yeah that was really a nuisance and she didn't even acknowledge [laughter] problem [laughter] everyone she was having wonderful place oh wow [laughter] and yeah four year old anyway i'm sorry that she didn't even acknowledge that but <unk> probably hit her later you know you know but she she did did remember but it seems that they said <unk> reverse <unk> the the idea of getting somebody else to pay was a good idea yeah it's a great idea and and that's nice because she can do that much more often yeah yeah it's wonderful for her too so that was really jazz anyways you guys had a nice time except for that <unk> is a josh's father okay yeah he's doing pretty well he's you know he had a very mild stroke i think if you have a stroke at all he had the best kind you can have <unk> um and evidently it's uh he has an irregular heartbeat which is what they think caused it the kind that if it's irregular all the time i'm evidently it causes <unk> the possibility of causing a clot is very high <unk> <unk> and so um they don't quite understand if they're gonna do this or not but sometimes they administer a small shock to try and get it sort of back on track <unk> um so it gets back to normal beat but otherwise you just try with drugs or something well no what they do is they um give him drugs for an anti coagulant so that whatever clot was in there and caused that hopefully gets dissolved <unk> but then they you know they have to monitor that very closely because for example a week and a half ago they said okay um you can't shave until we see you again [laughter] in other words you'll bleed to death if you are oh yeah see it's a very dangerous what's actually what's more dangerous is that some sort of internal bleeding begins and you don't know about it until you're dead so yeah but they they cut them down to one checkup all week instead of too which is very promising yeah and you know how it goes those little things i'm sure you recall are very meaningful [laughter] yeah yeah absolutely i was i was at a meeting yesterday and ah that was the something to do with the hospital until we went we had we had lunch at the hospital <unk> it's really weird going into the hospital one must have been very weird yeah have you been into that hospital since <unk> no no um but as i've been <unk> you know i've been looking at it for awhile already so it was okay uh-huh and i was looking <unk> is it i was there for two days for meeting the day before i had already looked up because i know the walkway between the two parts of the buildings were i would walk <unk> you know things like that so that was okay and we had coffee down into normal coffee place uh-huh so and the people there <unk> were there until we joked about things and and there was one uh-huh what was the knitting therefore it was about <unk> you know at the hospital yeah there's a there's a group of people who do work uh in computer stuff in languages should also hospital oh oh i see so anyway you been horribly busy yes horribly horribly horribly but now it's now it's over with now it's okay good <unk> <unk> <unk> start to feel normal again uh-huh [laughter] how long do you get to feel normal again <unk> i'm not sure but anyway for the time being a normal uh-huh uh-huh it's a it's going through a you're getting back to normal it seems like going through your email uh-huh and <unk> you know like chinese meal and cleaning out the last two hundred messages that you had ignored that you didn't have time to to look it oh my god that sounds like a nightmare [laughter] i come home to three messages on my answering machine and practically shut the thing offer exactly sushi wish lightning would strike and just break it or something [noise] anyway so you had <unk> nice time with jesse yeah <unk> yeah yeah i had a wonderful time with jesse that was really great except she probably told you don't go to santa barbara during fiesta it's not the time to go to santa barbara <unk> they're twenty million people there i mean no kidding but it was really fun anyway but we get sort of burned out going downtown 'cause you can't do the fourth of july there's not that many people not compared you're not overwhelmed by people yeah nothing like fiesta i mean it was nothing and that's probably you know we don't have much to compare well you have more because you've been there more but that's probably more than is usually there and fiesta that means i think half of los angeles went to santa barbara for fiesta [laughter] but um it was fun anyway well was i didn't care where i was with jesse if i just you know <unk> traffic jam and talk to her i don't really care but <unk> <unk> what did you <unk> fiesta anyway and <unk> well it's i don't know it's a general term i mean they have that new mexico too it's just it's a hispanic celebration i don't know what if if it even <unk> you know <unk> a knowledge of some particular date or anything i think it's just a yearly you know festival like like carnival or something you know just the time everybody gets dressed up and there were you know hundreds of incredibly cute little kids all wearing the you know <unk> fairly out if it had already makeup and they look so proud of themselves and they were really really cute but it's just you know lots <unk> parades lots and lots of parades remain parades seem to be the the main thing to do and then you know stands where you can get all kinds of you know tacos and this kind of thing and <unk> [noise] sorry bands singing and stuff like that so i don't really know what it is beyond that but it was really fun anyways but <unk> you didn't know that was any special historical not that i know of no i mean in new mexico it's same they just have something called fiesta and it just everybody has a big party and yeah i don't i don't know if there's anything connected to it or not but anyway that was lots of fun to a house <unk> and and then well yeah but then they'd been there since in the meantime too at your place <unk> yeah that's right that was after yeah right they didn't win didn't win a unjust father had that's right that's <unk> for the times 'cause they went to congratulate you on the <unk> <unk> oh yeah boy are they cute they're that was so sweet of them you know that jesse had seen those six one six months before that and remembered which was amazing to me and i kept refusing to try them on because i thought [noise] you know why should i try to monitor two hundred dollars i'm not going to buy them but anyway she remembered so that was really really sweet and um anyway have them that was it was fun visit unfortunately that all happened with josh's dad right when we were going to go somewhere but um we had a fun time anyway and some friends of mine were looking around um portal you know where jesse did jesse tell you where they went and <unk> said well i don't remember that she said the name or anything just it was somewhere yeah it's this place it's very special to them that they um told us about and we went and visited it before we even came here <unk> and it's just this little beautiful canyon that looks like paradise the minute you walk into it and they have little cabins for rent there and when josh my first visited before we even moved here we both just went oh let's just buy one of those cabins and i just can't forget about having a cat [laughter] we can have a cafe where one person the day comes and has a cup of coffee [laughter] anyway it's really really pretty and evidently michael has um actually jesse went with him years and years ago when he was at u._c._l._a. there's a research station up in this canyon and and well yeah because she had said to me that <unk> the one to to have since he's been more <unk> different yeah right anyway so that's how that spot came into the picture and they finally went there and stayed there and had a wonderful time <unk> and some friends of mine who live here we're looking at property for sale all over the place and that was one of the places they were looking in that particular area and so i got them to give me the real estate map of where it was sent it to jesse michael [laughter] hoping to uh and i put a little arrow that said you were here hoping to egg them on so most high time that they buy something somewhere <unk> yeah well i you know i figure i mean it's not a my business and you know it's it's hard to say what what people you know i asked i asked jesse point blank you know can you are you in a position to buy something right now it's you know the land here relatively speaking it's really cheap i mean like five hundred dollars and acre you know and she said yeah so i thought shit you know whatever happens maybe they should just buy some land and you know it's <unk> whatever they can come and camp on it you know when they come to visit because they don't like bed and breakfasts and you know it's sometimes it's good when you have the money to get the things you want because yeah <unk> gone you know getting getting places for a long time and they just never get around to get any place yeah i know well i think i mean i'm just imagining you know what their position is 'cause it's i'm sure it's it's very hard when you're doing something and you can't get out of it you know to do any any they won't but <unk> but they can at least to have you know some vacation time or something right or you know whatever whatever happens in the future if you buy some land <unk> it's yours <unk> no i mean in the taxes <unk> nothing you can always sell it in in which case you yeah but now is the time because real estate's really going up around here now i'm southeastern arizona has gotten a lot of attention and i think there's lots of urban refugee type stuff happening where people are unhappy more and more with the city and they don't know what to do or how to leave for how to make a living but a lot of people just come here and go fuck it i'll figure something out you know so it's kind of a strange thing to be happening you know very sort of anti what we were all brought up to to do [laughter] you know it's kind of backwards of the american dream where you get your career and your little house and everything and anyway so i've been trying to tempt them [laughter] so i told him that we would go and look at this property if they wanted but um anyway yeah but they also fixed <unk> and <unk> christmas vacation there so uh yeah yeah well when i heard about that i thought gee maybe uh maybe they really you know or she obviously they're attracted to that area i think michael even more so it's kind of isolated <unk> but anyway i think with those guys you know they just assume go camp out somewhere and stay in a bed and breakfast and have to have breakfast with fifteen people they never met before [laughter] [laughter] they usually come running over here instead <unk> even though the breakfast is paid for him and we sit on the patio and breakfast instead <unk> bed and breakfast place that drives me crazy too yeah it's it's kind of it's not my thing i actually found a little apartment i mean just to be for you to if you were interested in it on our house is hard to put up i mean we can't one person's okay with two it gets pretty hard but the way we just changed everything around and it it's really not much privacy at all for it you know people visiting but we just found some acquaintances of ours that come to the cafe they have a very small apartment that they rent two people visiting which <unk> you know has little tiny kitchen and <unk> it's just very nice and private right you just have your own place right so it's not a hotel or it's not a place like some of these places and does beer you know the bathrooms down the hall this kinda thing yeah for not so much fun <unk> inexpensive besides and other than that there are these nice been breakfast but anyway that's a nice option it's thirty bucks a night <unk> because they have an extra apartment or if they do they have like a little in what's called and inlaw apartment here uh-huh like a small apartment you know which totally separate entrance and all that and it has little kitchen and everything so i think that'd be a nice things for <unk> <unk> <unk> that's what <unk> did you have to build yourself and <unk> [laughter] right well just blast a hole in the walk underneath our house [laughter] that'd be nice anyway yeah anyway how's how's <unk> it's going okay this month has been kind of slow but for the most part it's we're doing pretty good it's you know it's uh [noise] we live in such a small town that you have to sort of gear your expectations down a little bit from <unk> you know when you live in a town that's only got sixty five hundred people in it um your you know customer pool is is very tiny yeah and we've we've been you know breaking even for a long time we would like to make a little bit more so that we can not weren't quite so hard mhm but i most of the time we feel really pretty lucky that we are have done as well as we have given given how small town is and all that yeah <unk> <unk> the question is simply to rationalize in in a way that <unk> you make enough money and it's still fun for you yeah that's the you know and you have to figure out what <unk> what's the best way to rationalize that you know yeah it's hard to say 'cause sometimes you getting another mood like a string of things happen like josh's dad and had to go away and that was kind of expensive for us to replace him and then of course you know he's upset and everybody's upset and i was upset and that gets exhausting and then you know the next the first days off we had together i went i got stung by scorpion which is no big deal it's just that nobody heard it was horrible pain for <unk> <unk> it it it was ridiculously long i mean i had to ice my leg ten minutes on ten minutes off for twelve hours which is really boring [laughter] yeah and it's a real i mean there goes your whole day you know and they don't they have pain pills for that no they don't actually <unk> not not that i know of any way that's all they tell you to just do that and you know i did it for so i actually gave myself a little frostbite i mean i <unk> i made a little burn on my leg try [laughter] i mean <unk> <unk> well for how long can you keep track of ten minutes on and ten years off and <unk> you know it was really ridiculous and it's you know <unk> once you find out you're not allergic to them and you're not going to have convulsions and die you know [laughter] it's no big deal except that it hurt like holy hell <unk> <unk> it's like it's like a burn pain where it gets to this level where you think you're going to scream if you don't put the ice back on you know anyway so that that was one <unk> our first day off and then the plumbing backed up twice in the last three two two and a half weeks and the cafe one but it back up at ten o'clock in the morning on saturday <unk> that was in life and [laughter] [noise] so we had to close for the rest of the day and if all on leading up to as if if things like that happen you know a few weeks in a row <unk> your mood kinda tends to go to hell <unk> yeah that <unk> level is somewhere around zero yeah and you start going this sucks you know and i'm sick of being poor and i'm sick of these false and then it goes away and you go oh it's not so bad you know we're really not <unk> you know we're really pretty lucky in a lot of ways so it's that's all i'm trying to say is your mood sort of it's hard to it's hard to judge these things sometimes you know it's um so it's just this week this week was just fine this week was fine um and ah you know it's very quiet downtown so we don't take it personally that were that the businesses will quiet and it's it's not that quiet either so you also didn't have these <unk> people coming and stuff uh-huh yeah we do we have a you know pretty regular lunch it's you know it's kind of town also where people's income is small enough that i'm the only people that really can afford to go out to lunch and then people will go out to breakfast you know coffee and stuff like that but [noise] lunches more of a luxury so you you haven't even smaller pool of people who worked for the county for example <unk> and have you know really steady jobs um but we ever really nice bunch especially from the court house there's a group of the whole public defenders office comes in and they're really fun bunch and they always have these wild arguments which are really fun and interesting to listen to [laughter] [noise] yeah you get to watch the local politics and <unk> yeah you do actually and uh they're really smart you know i'm for the most part liberal bunch who are very open about lots of you know the things that they think and i guess public defenders offices are are generally i'm usually pretty liberal do gooder type you know people <unk> who want to you know they don't get paid very much and basically you know it's all sort of you know it's subsidized you know i'm defense for people who can't afford to hire a lawyer <unk> um that they're really nice bunch she'll she'll there <unk> idealistic too emotionally yeah they are although there there you know very down to earth when you talk to them about you know what it means to try and be do good are and how quickly you learn that you know they are one woman that i'm particularly friendly with the public defender like her a lot um [noise] she is in the juvenile department and <unk> it's particularly frustrating 'cause they're screwed up kids and the parents are screwed up to and you know she'll ask them you know what's their name and what happened and <unk> and do it well just tell me what happens now and then <unk> said he didn't do it you know it's just <unk> just just tell me what happens you know then the next time they have an appointment they don't show up right and so here's the public defender trying to say that the judge they're coming <unk> really they are coming you know after days and days of preparing to defend this person that's questionable anyway so [noise] anyway it's yeah it's <unk> would you say you know everybody in town yeah pretty much [laughter] it's a very small town yeah exactly <unk> different life where it's a little bit <unk> where people say so that's why you're walking out your front door where were you going this afternoon [laughter] hey what do you mean <unk> just working at the front door and never mind [noise] but for the most part it's pretty friendly people are people are fairly gossipy here which is not surprising but it's also pretty easy to to keep out of it somehow i don't know we don't find it too hard to just stay out of it and well that's part of life and and that kind of situation because there's not much else to do right right and they also it's fairly friendly for the most part once in a while people get kinda vicious and <unk> about it and it turns me off a lot and i people tell me stuff i wish i don't want to hear it you know i mean i just wish they didn't <unk> sometimes i tell people i don't want to hear it you know just don't even tell me [noise] but um for the most part it's pretty friendly because i think also since you're sort of stuck with each other here you are inspired and motivated to get along because for the most part everybody's gonna stay here [laughter] yeah right <unk> <unk> there's <unk> there's a higher level of tolerance for them mhm and there really is here too i mean people differ about all kinds of things politics and stuff and there's a level of friendliness that's very nice i mean i i enjoy being greeted by people it's um i find it it's it takes me a little getting used to go like i visited berkeley this summer and everybody the minute they see you they look away like they're scared you know what <unk> you're going to do something to them they're that's just not here i mean that love people aren't afraid of each other and that way you know <unk> you can't afford to be because you can still see the person everyday right right but also that fear of i don't know when when you're in a larger place i think it just naturally you have to shut out a lot 'cause it's too much stimulation i mean you just get over stimulated if you said if you said hide every single person used by walking the streets of geneva you'd be iraq and and our you know [laughter] cats you know i mean actually i think people have their small culture is like in your business so that you know you have your small yeah right <unk> <unk> you know the <unk> but <unk> too <unk> they're just wonderful guy who are <unk> i don't know where he lives <unk> live somewhere but he always walks around here <unk> crazy <unk> crazy and he's <unk> just referred to by everybody in that everybody knows <unk> they don't know him but they know of human we call the cardinal the cardinal yet because you know sort of sort of semi preaching has sort of semi telling the world off uh-huh [laughter] and you know and and then lots of times it's totally incoherent to talk city has but it's real loud voice uh-huh carries over the streets <unk> just <unk> <unk> uh-huh and so you just hear him and you say oh the cardinals talking and write the cardinal that's pretty good we have a guy like that his name is bible bob and he just goes around <unk> about the bible i mean endlessly really sometimes he stops and kicks curve but that's about it he's just sort of takes them he stops actually regularly in front of across the street from our places the statue the iron man and he has a pretty long conversations with the iron man <unk> yeah [laughter] the the the cardinal he gets a little book in the right things yeah uh-huh [laughter] surely iraq it's that's pretty funny [laughter] case religion <unk> it'd be great and how's josh otherwise <unk> pretty good he's he's very good he's banging around the living room right now we're we're painting our living room we have this one third of our house that we were trying to pretend didn't exist because it's so ugly and year and a half later we finally decided well [laughter] it doesn't seem to be going away so let's let's love it and take care of instead so we're fixing <unk> well <unk> what's <unk> what's it useful for <unk> uh well it's the main room that you walk into when you enter the house so it's about a third of the square footage of the house [laughter] so it'll become the main living room um when we're done fixing it up we've sort of been living and all the other parts of the house intriguing that room and <unk> have you have another room that you just sort of ignored yes right right so we just decided that's this is silly because we're not going to be able to afford it do major work on it for who knows how long so it looks much better it's already we painted half of it last week and whereabouts pay the other half of it i don't know what he's doing in their banging around it's covered with um fake plastic would handling like all all like all over the place like on the ceiling i mean these people i don't know what was on their minds but some guy about thirty or forty years ago came through busy with fake plastic would paneling and made a fortune because all over everything and the people here so funny i mean they just went a great let's put it on the ceiling too that looks good to know [laughter] really no he's ripping it off right now we're we're just gonna when you painted it looks fine it just looks like a wall i mean it doesn't look awful anymore <unk> how's your cute little apartment <unk> it's <unk> it's <unk> the same uh-huh hasn't hasn't the rules and only <unk> thinking about doing something well actually it's full right now it's very full full of well it's full of puzzle oh well that's living rooms full puzzle uh-huh seven thousand five hundred pieces <unk> what seven thousand five hundred <unk> oh my god what's it up and it's the skyline of new york oh wow that sounds pretty exciting <unk> thirty <unk> is sky uh-huh tired of it is water uh-huh and then there's surgery <unk> buildings in between and what did you start on the sky yes so of course you say the buildings for last right <unk> <unk> no actually i'm doing the buildings because i i couldn't quite <unk> this guy was <unk> some serious business yeah that <unk> three two thousand two hundred yes it was that guy [laughter] so it's been has clouds had crowds and <unk> oh that's good yeah that's nice so you're gonna get those mixed up with the clouds reflected in the water right no no the wires just pure or what additional reflection there oh well that makes it easier actually yeah sometimes the reflections or the jesse tell you we did a puzzle in santa barbara i insisted on getting one that we could actually do and today i was afraid were going to start the puzzle and you know it'll just be stupid and we actually did it and half a day so that was kind of a um it was cute though yeah but that's that's <unk> that's the time to do i suppose you haven't been doing that recently no not really although i'd like to winters coming and that's a good thing to do in winter like into the <unk> you must have some <unk> i said i've center some recently that she can pass onto mhm yeah actually i enjoy doing a lot this one that's jesse and i did was like an extended um morning puzzle was like a big morning puzzle you probably could do it in five minutes but it was good i hadn't done a puzzle long time so lots of fun yeah have you been doing more cards and stuff like that yeah lots of cards people buying <unk> cafe all the time it's really fun actually <unk> <unk> or employees usually snatch up most of them the minute i bring them in they have these friends that that

[laughter] [laughter] which her daughter wanted i mean she thought this is great i'll just send us to my friends and it'll tell everybody where i'm at so i made a whole bunch and that was pretty soon

santa fe that really they're really good one yeah they're great one that really got me going in 'em and she's sold that to a friend and now she just has catalogues and she moved here and she produces rubber stamps and ah she's really really nice person and we've got to be good friends so i occasionally go to her house and mess around with stuff and um occasionally i draw stuff for her to turn into stamps so it's really neat she sends away for a plate some kind of metal plate and then she has this thing called the <unk> that you put the plate and and the lady the river

i guess diners you'll get she was a little bit <unk> little bit depressed for some reason though because he's living off campus yeah but <unk> i think she's doing i mean other than that she's doing well she's getting used to it and everything yeah yeah so i think what else is uh have you talked <unk> mom and dad you know because um it was just a junior came back i got i had a letter from them okay that mom and dad had lost my address and phone number so i had a i wrote them a letter and they <unk> they should have gotten it by now did they <unk> yeah yeah she said that you could cause a white called with the address cause i wouldn't be wanting to do this phone thing but i didn't know um and you know where you know when you're settled in and so yeah so yeah i'm mark you <unk> his marks actually living at home right now huh yeah he's a stay there until um [noise] uh he's <unk> he's a he's gonna move to back until like either it's someplace where you can get a job yeah these and step mom and dad's house for <unk> for a few more weeks yeah a couple more weeks and then he's going to try to you know find a job it's okay so but he's he's <unk> he's been hooked up with some yeah different programs but uh i'm trying to think what else is god i'm christian michelle's ah um what's nathan <unk> did you hear about that no [laughter] ah let's see how <unk> he was um [noise] um he actually was has <unk> was caught stealing oh really yeah and there's could be certain charges pressed but i'm i'm <unk> that's going to be worked out i mean that that happened like four <unk> four weeks ago <unk> was pretty much have settled but there was a that the lumber yard yeah they had um had a detective who um oh yeah he was caught selling <unk> you know to a person lumber [laughter] so yeah that's i i i've seen i've forgotten all about the um when you mentioned that i i was under the impression that you already know about you know [laughter] things work this way [laughter] no worry i'm not worried yeah it it was i was one of those yeah in fact i was the last one to find out <unk> next to last [laughter] right i hit it was just one of those things yeah but um so that that has to go the other <unk> well <unk> each kid has to go through this i guess i know there's always something new yeah so yeah that was interesting but i'm <unk> so yeah i think what else i mean i guess that would be the kind of like the the the major news <unk> yeah [noise] uh see <unk> i'm in <unk> and that's when i talked to it it's that guy started school yet no one back in the school <unk> school i'm working with children right i'm sure what are you doing right now you're <unk> you're not you're not working at the hospital or you you were at the v._a. hospital she's working at the v._a. hospital veteran's hospital huh she's doing their she does like a group counseling and stuff like that and <unk> i'm here with two sisters some seated on right and that's the island next to india yup and i think it's pretty neat that that you married a girl that's <unk> that's from india oh they think it's neat yeah yeah yeah well <unk> she'll be gone she might be hopefully she's going to go back through the summer so good uh this summer this summer i should be coming home yeah what would you know what have you have any tentative no i have not it'll probably i have no idea probably july august all yeah she <unk> she called us in the spring uh-huh so yeah yeah that's funny well see <unk> this is for both of us it's far lost your residence yeah and then once were you know we still have to do to write her dissertation but um we won't have to be going to school and stuff like that that'll be nice after thirty years at school oh yeah really so that aspect will be done and um so yeah so trying to think what else are you <unk> are you following the pope's visit in the united states yeah yeah yeah it was he was uh it turned out very good that's good i heard some lady died while he was saying nazism oh i'm sure there's a lot of people i'm sure that <unk> statistically the good chance of someone yeah yeah it actually was um the uh the uh the coverage was pretty <unk> or the um the sense was good because i'm <unk> oh yeah it's <unk> you know his presence uh-huh you know how he has his presence of people are attracted to his presidents and yeah yeah you know that that whole phenomena's still and visit the italians made it sound that they were he wasn't being getting much attention and the reporters weren't ready and they weren't they weren't <unk> he wasn't giving getting a good coverage in the united states well i know before <unk> well they may be true true ah i mean to some extent i i haven't like it's not like i have a yeah i don't watch t._v. so i don't know what's on t._v. but um the um the news <unk> end up see before they had various theologians who are critics with him <unk> who were um you know saying that you know he's just he's not in touch and all that stuff yeah there there was that aspect but once he was here with the amazing thing you know because it doesn't make any difference what's the process because because once he has those huge crowds yeah <unk> yeah they're still like <unk> mind boggled that you know he gets these huge crowds yeah yeah and his ability to have like instant conversions i mean i've i've known tons of people and they're just they're they've had instant conversions yeah that's good so i mean it <unk> i mean granted he depressed doesn't necessarily help right there's something about him where he's he doesn't need the <unk> yeah i mean yeah i mean 'cause he's able to get the um [noise] you know so that yeah i mean and and <unk> i guess it's <unk> you just become so it's so much part of it you expect there will be this <unk> like they'll bring up all these <unk> like statistics how people will <unk> while they like the pope they disagree twenty so uh-huh i mean they'll they always do so you oh yeah just make 'em around them towards right but uh i know but just <unk> it's amazing how um you know it's <unk> you know people who <unk> <unk> an incredible affect <unk> ah what it is but um [noise] so yeah that yet i i've been <unk> i've been following it pretty close <unk> through the papers and stuff but um yeah so he's leaving about right now he'll be leaving pretty soon yeah because he's only staying five days yeah he leaves today tonight <unk> so yeah so how was julius stay back and <unk> and like i i really haven't even seen her since she got back i i only one of the sisters came down <unk> sicily so they sent me the letter ah just wanting her family was yeah i have no idea [laughter] that's funny <unk> to find out [laughter] right [laughter] yeah 'cause i i don't i haven't bought like i'm <unk> mark is trying to get hold of john yeah yeah because i yeah i had written because he wants to see about me margaret things were going to sometimes vocational school but um and john and the school yeah <unk> yeah <unk> areas and <unk> and i think you know i don't know so i'm trying to think what else is um is happening in those big world here yeah it's just basically we're <unk> we're back to the grinding stone of pears in or stuff like that so i with one of the people i teach with um a he's he's doing like he's principally responsible for all the english translations for john paul's work oh i see oh that's nice yeah <unk> and i'm just like you know with all sorts <unk> neither here nor there but i'm sure i think what else i i just for the moment called i had no i just like well <unk> what time is right now it's okay it's um it's twenty nine okay we already changed our time did you guys don't we sent <unk> back there no that's coming up pretty soon yeah we do it before you guys do okay so it's nine thirty no it's twenty <unk> nine thirty eight thirty you're only like five hours behind right now yeah yeah right behind right [noise] so gosh what what <unk> you know i wanna get a how is this with the <unk> that's is it anything is that just more or less what it is it's pretty much <unk> anything that's going to happen or not going to happen it's pretty much done right uh i think so yeah yeah how's the mail order i think they're doing pretty good 'cause i don't have too much contact with them right right and so i i really have no idea to tell you the truth <unk> yeah <unk> <unk> i'm here <unk> i even i know that this summer they did a vocational camp but i have no idea how it went right because then being down <unk> sicily it's you know we're down [laughter] oh you're in byron out <unk> yeah i'm surprised you guys have a house or well yeah we have two houses and sicily oh really yeah we're twenty minutes apart right right and so and and the next year we should be going to fatima oh well it'll be a big break for you <unk> yeah [noise] yeah for the first of october some of the system <unk> like how many of them there was eight sisters that made their final vows oh and then the twenty ninth of october fourteen sisters make their first vows how many fourteen good and they're the ones that went diana was with them <unk> okay yeah okay and then we'll have three that into <unk> shit okay good i don't know how many well do the <unk> come and do the pasta and see yeah i don't know <unk> <unk> <unk> i don't know how you <unk> do things but um if you ever get <unk> like if there's either sisters in in in rome like smith the midwest they should go to stevenville uh-huh yeah i'm going to be very 'cause if i you know like the <unk> if you have like the dominican sisters national i was very influential helping them get sisters and <unk> and also the um the daughters <unk> saint paul's yeah the daughters <unk> saint paul are good sisters yeah in in america i <unk> i have a very close ah you know <unk> i've helped him out so many different ways are you getting their <unk> their religious said programs to parishes and and help them with their vocations and <unk> what about sister has a sister in that order right yeah yeah they're i mean there i mean they're becoming around <unk> mean there's yeah of course they always the ones that i know are the ones that are really north from cleveland and uh they uh they said that you know of course they <unk> they they still have some troubles like <unk> italian sisters but uh yeah i don't know yeah i mean i don't know what exactly they meant by that but [noise] but i mean a job and they have like a moderate increase in a job but um yeah that's <unk> <unk> if you ever get if you ever get <unk> we have a sister that lives in in illinois and she lives or i mean um families <unk> i see i see well illinois so that's close <unk> very close yeah there'll be it would just uh in fact if you ever needed help i mean diana gonna help you <unk> illinois <unk> father mike would love to have it yeah you know they have to have a have a week for vocations mhm <unk> anything like that but you have <unk> if you know it's it's i mean i'm sure you guys are i mean the american situations probably somewhat far off but it wasn't even just from like the recruiting <unk> and when <unk> like some of the sisters have gone to summer camps done <unk> they they did one this summer done by done in um close to chicago and married town <unk> they did a camp yeah oh that's great she was supposed to be there for a week and let her father died and so she was only <unk> she was able to stay she didn't stay for the whole time <unk> say ten days or something we'd ten days right and then their father died and so she went home okay but they they did it this year last year <unk> an actual summer camps yeah for for us towards two thousand right i think it was from <unk> i don't know <unk> would <unk> run by him <unk> i think <unk> i don't remember very well anymore right <unk> <unk> interesting <unk> great [noise] so <unk> what <unk> what did you what do you do know what are your what your responsibilities again okay working in a in a perish perish work okay <unk> him and <unk> get <unk> getting into this mentality is a little bit difficult because and they they want they they give you all their their heart you know they give you all the affection and they love you like a family member right they give you a they put all their trust into you but then they want you to do the same thing to them uh and you have to be careful because um because lots of times they pretend that you do much for them but then they this is where that this is what i can understand the mafia here because then <unk> so you think that they're being very hundred percent truthful insincere but they're they're they're capable of um being here with you and then going around and and talking behind your back and say you have to be careful that you're given them i'm jay then the an open with you and and and me being open with them because if i'm too open with them and i'm too opened and um it gets in wrong because then they they know too much or they think they know too much and they and you don't have that trust they don't give you that trust anymore or they do to faces like family already breeds contempt i mean uh yeah and they're also very you have to be very careful because sometimes they get offended very easily and so you have to know how to i'm sure treat them but then what they <unk> they expect to love <unk> is that they'd be a priest or not they don't want them you know they have a big big respect for for religious right and like if you know they'll ask you advice for everything <unk> even for <unk> stupid things you know they'll ask yeah and and if you say no you have to go to a church walking backwards you know they believe you and they'll walk to church backwards to say no what what the sister says is true is is is important is truth and so that's why you have to be careful because if you if you type that says something and everything or get go exaggerate you know like like if you kind of exaggerate okay <unk> they're going to take your word for it even if they shouldn't take your word for it you know i can talk to you like a brother and you're going to say yeah yeah she's just saying like that you don't you don't take me seriously yeah but they take me seriously and so you know you gotta power other callers ones right [laughter] yeah well i know i'd <unk> you know he's all that <unk> was when <unk> was <unk> an advantage i'm <unk> <unk> so so they're mostly <unk> and stuff like that or for the moment yes because after <unk> after still kind of get settled in because the priests his new and he's kind of um <unk> in nervous breakdown right and so i can't go too fast because he gets too nervous right right <unk> <unk> i would like to have in a group for you but he's not he doesn't want it and i just so i'm just taking a slowly but i follow the cat <unk> stay behind them the the the ladies and the girls that <unk> <unk> and so and then there are there's a lot of young kids because here there's nothing you have nothing you know like i was and they don't have they don't have <unk> <unk> <unk> dancing in somebody that <unk> that teaches <unk> english after school activities they don't have anything they don't have a gym they don't have a pool they have nothing right and <unk> and so whatever the church offers is goals even if it's just seeing it in the choir right and so you're able to you gotta lot then here a lot of the young kids don't go to school then don't work because they have a very bad problem with finding jobs you've got a lotta kids hanging around don't do enough not doing nothing right and <unk> and this one is capable of 'em are going <unk> organizing something for the kids you can get <unk> for the youth you can get a a good group going <unk> nothing right well <unk> have your hands full then oh yeah [noise] so then um so there's you and <unk> there's two other sisters they're right yeah we're just three were supposed to be for <unk> was freak what have you had to do a lot of there's another parish here and so the the <unk> the other sister works works does the same things that i do their she does here and then the mother she she kinda has both places under control <unk> you guys are you guys have a commitment to to parishes right so you do kinda chemical working this person and then someone else's chemical work and the other parish yeah <unk> and then also she has a good voice so she has two groups of of the of the choir and which is good because there she has the choir for the littler kids and the ones for the bigger kids <unk> she has <unk> contact and i i'm with the with the <unk> contact with them but she doesn't just leave it to the choir <unk> they do other things and then they come to her and they talk and um she she helps them out and everything she <unk> she kinda fall it has a personal touch touch which keeps it keeps her busy okay so the one that i hear you <unk> it's so right i'm like <unk> just want a straight answer here you know uh these <unk> you kinda gotta work than the mothers to periods well besides her misery of duties does um [noise] uh she does a music and then the other person does <unk> okay mother has she she has the cat <unk> group <unk> she's she follows the capital group and and also being that many of them i knew she <unk> she follows them quite closely you know she gives them a hand because they don't have that much <unk> experience and then um the parish priests has always asking her and information <unk> and <unk> and all that stuff because he's <unk> he's new here as a parish priest and he's only been here a couple of years instead mother's been here six five <unk> five years and so she knows the mentality better and so and then many adults to go to her because here mother superior is very important and they consider her it's it's like um oppressed teach 'em off because like they go to her and they ask <unk> there's always people call in they'll come in and and talking and asking <unk> seeing how they she kept keeps quite busy that way <unk> understand what i said yeah i mean so she has <unk> yeah yeah <unk> whether she wanted a she has she spends a lot of time <unk> passed all typed yeah listening to a lot of people [laughter] yeah and then the other sister does kind of kind of the other the other she has she does not too much <unk> got all she follows the choir and the kids <unk> she has a youth group the younger kids group okay okay well <unk> has been since then um so you guys have your basic your religious life and then uh uh then you have your specific <unk> ah yeah like in the morning we we get all her purse done in the morning and and our lecture in a community luck should we do in the morning because <unk> <unk> <unk> as from three <unk> like i leave <unk> three and sometimes i and i get back at eight o'clock okay remember [noise] so do you have like an office you workout over you know well the church has the parish office legitimate where you <unk> like that where you're kind of hang out there yeah and then when <unk> slowly ones whose cat <unk> and get started and everything like everyday this cat it gives them for different groups there's a cat <unk> but i have to kind of keep it under <unk> keep it under control organize it and make sure things are going okay but then visit the families and i have to especially being that i knew i wanted to visit the the kids whose families because i have a group of cat <unk> until <unk> and <unk> know the families because there's a lot of situations here of poverty and and <unk> and <unk> and family problems no yeah and so if i can get into the families i can understand the children more and and and everything right right right <unk> <unk> yeah that's interesting no i i um it sounds like <unk> it's more than just a cat a chemical yeah man it's yeah it's almost that is a way is a kind of like a vehicle whereby than you're able to do other things yeah exactly yeah i um through <unk> and we get to the families right okay so wow so how how's uh though i know i had a pretty much where my head um [noise] so i just saw the um [noise] you know the we might just always gonna be cut off too so it's okay <unk> <unk> you know i'll send you all your birthday cards [laughter] off into my also came <unk> through the birthday cards but okay do you think it's a good idea if i get a a blessing other <unk> for mom and dad's <unk> because this is their fortieth year yeah so definitely i mean i don't think they have or do they have any people blessings and i know i i got i got one for you and and chris and that's it i think i remember getting <unk> little getting three right right right well um i don't think it would hurt i mean it's [laughter] i would i would <unk> i mean i'm no i probably would be good i mean it's i i don't see why not i mean <unk> yeah you can be pretty fun so gosh <unk> <unk> so you basically pretty wants all settled in and stuff like this and i'm <unk> <unk> are you know <unk> are you guys going to um [noise] i'm a dentist mentioning once you guys are taking classes are <unk> who mentioned it danny or their dad <unk> yeah the the new <unk> the <unk> the new sisters that are going to school okay and after after

like that and then um [noise] so they're coming for three weeks i'm supposed to spend christmas my christmas vacation in texas with them and they're coming for three weeks the only time that we both have three mhm meanwhile it's like he just ignores me when we're around them and i ended up three days we were there he and his brother and his father sat and watched cricket all day and i had to like clean the house and do the cooking and watch sam [noise] i don't know <unk> you know it's incredible and then <unk> only vacation <unk> spent my christmas vacation which is the only time going to get to see him yeah with them and i said i can't do it and um then i told them that i really wanted him to come up for christmas so we could all be together for christmas and i just i just can't be with them every time i mean i really struggled with that i really tried to get psyched myself to do it every time i thought about it just burst into tears yeah you know i love christmas and things that i loved these people mhm i really loved them and the fact that they could turn on me like that to me that they never really cared about me the obviously never approved at me or why would they be treated me like the nation wide all happy that we're back together right yeah but it's probably they maybe the time they took their son's side and you know they thought oh my gosh you know she took a child away and she hurt i mean i always take boy's side <unk> always take the <unk> i know i know but it's just really hurt that they could i'm sure like that i mean i think that they should have seen that you know maybe this was nobody's fault maybe it was both of our faults and certainly they should be very happy for all of us that we're together <unk> support us and did you talk on me now because i didn't really realize what's going on when we were there i didn't know that was feeling bad yeah and <unk> they're so in direct mhm they have this weird english owner we're nice and polite yeah yeah but meanwhile cold like ice exactly exactly so it was very hard to put it together and they was the one i thought that they were being very um disapproving of sam but dave was the one who told me not with me i mean most of the stuff i'm getting about them getting from him so i don't even know like what is he just trying to make me feel bad you know what i mean you know but i think that it's true i mean at the same time he could be doing things to help keep me from getting so bad you know <unk> like he doesn't have to tell me all these things i think he really wanted me to feel bad he really wanted me to be punished mhm you know and and what did i do i mean i was the one that got us back together and i've been over backwards to make the relationship work i've done everything he said i was doing wrong that was keeping him from being happy yeah yeah <unk> work that way i know it doesn't but you know it's like oh it's just all them essence disgusting but anyway so that's been the most recent [noise] so what how do you feel about them said okay now it's okay how you <unk> you know i you know i feel completely broken hearted devastated [laughter] yeah i really do i feel like i've put

what it's like the feel isolated looking like you know what's going on in the world from day to day barely do i read i mean we we have a a paper that they <unk> the stars and stripes but it's all oriented mostly towards like you know obviously military type stuff 'cause the audience <unk> so i have a good idea what's going on in the old international arena but as far as to what's going on in the states you know relatively cool with [noise] other than the o._j. trial thing [laughter] that was the day after the o. j. verdict <unk> the stars and stripes is usually only twenty to thirty pages

nine yards mean kind of the ways <unk> looked but it's very different from the way we look and he's wandering around what we're doing the training and asking questions like and so what's that thing do machine guns and you try to explain but he doesn't really understand and then he goes there it's a story which ends up on the front page of the wall street journal it's like you know hundreds of thousands of people are going to read about third battalion three hundred twenty fifth anniversary and about what we were training and it was just well it was a decent article and it made us look kind of good there was a lot of stuff in there that you could tell he just didn't understand <unk> wrote about it they came out kinda screwy and this is the impression <unk> gets <unk> which is unfortunate you know anyone against him well unfortunately they're going to believe that paper i mean civil court action which wall street journal <unk> what did it i don't remember unfortunately i'm gonna i'm gonna get a copy of it and it's been my dad will send you <unk> you want <unk> you know the university <unk> that's true and your library and i know how to find him either <unk> i don't remember what

using the walker mhm dot abusive claims that he she thinks he could be doing more from self than he is <unk> well you know that sounds like <unk> the and it's hard to know whether there's truth to it or not [laughter] no i don't know i remember like with with <unk> as being sticking surely both being sick <unk> was fighting so much and he just everything he <unk> he tried so hard <unk> and she was doing nothing oh wow she i mean i remember being in the hospital when the nurse finally yell litter <unk> started yelling at her and say look at if you don't help yourself no one can help you yeah you know she got just so depressed yeah and so miserable that she was doing nothing to help her <unk> yeah you know i think that's sort of you know something like a business but you know <unk> the <unk> had a kind of really shocked out of it mhm mhm and then suddenly members started improving leaps and bounds yeah yeah but i mean i wonder what point you just feel sort of too tired to fight anymore i mean that's sort of what <unk> sounded like she was afraid at the beginning right after the stroke about what he was going to be like but it sounds like you've gotten over that <unk> don't know i don't know <unk> was just sort of dreaming you know wishful thinking but she was talking about them maybe going out to see a concert a filler monica oh my god maybe even in driving again <unk> that even though <unk> i said to each other that certainly doesn't seem like <unk> he'll drive again yeah who knows yeah i just think that would be awfully risky for everybody <unk> drive i mean hasn't yes several strokes now <unk> ah no strong was the first or the second okay we've had several heart attacks and <unk> said several heart attack i mean you just don't know i don't know i don't know i mean you know the idea of him how to use <unk> him and he said <unk> i was like <unk> <unk> i don't know if you'd call it a professional driver yeah yeah <unk> <unk> <unk> long term dry right and <unk> think abe <unk> i i i think i would trust his judgment <unk> feeling that he's capable drive <unk> mm yeah except you know he's so independent yeah i don't know i mean you know maybe it'll be fine i just know that our grandfather you know <unk> um grandpa harris died <unk> heart attack at the steering wheel looking back in time december forty also yeah yeah i mean yeah that is true but you know when you have your older near the history of yeah harder did i mean israel the majority of the car accident i think er you know drunk driver you know word dangerous passing and that sort of stuff yeah <unk> <unk> um how are your headaches and um they actually are gone the only thing i'm the only thing left does it still sometimes the dizziness <unk> <unk> when i'm <unk> moving the head back and forth <unk> looking at something and from side to side mhm <unk> i've got the appointment the right that's the day that i feel kinda funny you know <unk> you know do i really need it but yeah <unk> i mean you know <unk> <unk> you know <unk> you know finish the check right alright haven't checked just like inner ear stuff no actually haven't i've got <unk> the doctor about that again 'cause i i mean is one of the more obvious sort of sources of of dizziness type of thing yeah well i guess probably maybe the reason that didn't check 'cause my original complaint the head it was the headaches yeah <unk> yeah added on later yeah there's this um i mean i don't think i mean your symptoms probably aren't there but i mean we're in the most miserable things that i ever had and i've completely forgotten the name of it but you can get this incredible disease i mean the whole and it's it's viral thing um no it was a bacterial thing that happened after <unk> viral thing and they had some medicine for where literally the world with spinning around <unk> something that he was so awful i mean it's just ah but i mean that was completely ears like the aftermath of an ear <unk> you know somehow you know bacteria ended up in the inner ear instead <unk> ear infection i got this <unk> from it um but i mean that is where you're you know balance center in and stuff and you know might be worth checking but [noise] um has avnir had more you know <unk> i mean is he just going to wait and see what the <unk> <unk> i mean we haven't really sat down really disgusted that you know serious i'm just waiting and seeing you know yeah yeah how's things <unk> i guess a hard thing is that how will you know when you know how things are going yeah that makes any sense well i i think i was going to be getting worse more so even a little while because uh this one guy who was like a a fresh <unk> breeze blown through the factory <unk> uh twenty four twenty five year old guy you mentioned him yeah well he starts studies the technion tuesday <unk> <unk> he's done <unk> and <unk> <unk> maybe miriam should meet him [laughter] he has a serious girlfriend <unk> okay [laughter] um but the i'm thinking <unk> definitely could be worse when he's not around <unk> yeah yeah right <unk> tell me what what <unk> um leaves that sort of miriam has what i'm well she had her final thing and they sounded encouraging there were two things through shut teal <unk> um but i'm not sure you know what they were called one maybe <unk> re route or something but i've heard of <unk> yeah that was one of them i don't know the other one um one may have been not not <unk> jewish and arab but just arab because i remember them saying something you know let her <unk> her what <unk> was in the galilee i mean saying what a good thing it could be for a jewish person to be you know in a circumstance like this survey would realize that jews actually you know have an interest and and i think that was something involving kids but i'm not sure maybe teenagers mhm um and then the other one i think and i don't know if the other one was raised or not i think that was the one that had to do with um [noise] a daycare center which has for both um it sounded actually very [noise] i could be very hard but a daycare center for jewish and arab kids and it was outside of either high far tel aviv i don't remember which one <unk> the problem is they were kids from really troubled homes and it's like it was very intensive daycare to avoid them being put in foster care oh wow you have <unk> and put the second goal of the thing is to increase sort of coexistence you know among these groups and miriam has more interested in the second goal and i mean the first call i mean it's something i think she could be interested in but i think emotionally can be so hard 'cause you're not going to be your your sort of average cute cheery yeah three year olds <unk> you know they may be abused they maybe you know who knows what's yeah um but i think there are other possibilities too and i think um you know what they said basically <unk> her and they sounded very positive and i looked at some of the letters or emails that she'd gotten from them they sounded really positive i'm like they were sure they would find something for her it's just they don't make any permanent assignments until the person meets with the people from that group <unk> <unk> i mean we're still when she comes arrives what does she has to do what the well she's going to at some point i mean she'll have to be in contact more these people in shut deal and i guess set up some meetings with these groups that they think we're his field you know no i don't know where they are headquartered <unk> might be jerusalem but i'm not sure <unk> <unk> um but you know they're like sort of a coordinator <unk> organization or something uh soon as she gets in the first immediately try to make phone calls i i've got <unk> a a room from the keyboards for two or three weeks mhm mhm i could probably extend it look at she could also stay in college but not she didn't <unk> that is not as convenient but you know yeah well i mean i think she'd like to arrange things you know pretty much <unk> soon as you can imagine <unk> few days just to unwind exactly but um but then i think she wants to get working and and some of them talk to some of these opportunities i'm they faxed her a bunch of stuff are are emailed her a bunch of stuff that some of these things provide housing absorption center some provide housing <unk> village which i told her to be real careful about the traditional arab village i don't think she wants to stay there i mean live there i think it would make it very hard for her to have a social life yeah that's true too i mean like after eight o'clock she couldn't be out and she couldn't be seen with a man who is not you know her blood relative present check not all those are like well that's true that's true <unk> <unk> i know the one that do you remember lowai yeah i mean his village apparently was quite traditional <unk> i'm <unk> but maybe wonder if she'll be allowed to visit lowai and you know he would not visit her the last time because i remember that 'cause if he's married now maybe he can i don't know <unk> yeah or maybe with his wife also won things for sure it's like <unk> she's <unk> <unk> what i'm sort of guessing is that <unk> um doctor is very close to where david lives like half an hour we didn't know that yeah maybe forty minutes <unk> i would guess and i'm david has a lot of friends there in bakaldorbia and some people who works with testing is that if <unk> you know if if it doesn't work otherwise with david mhm they could probably go together and visit you know to you know when <unk> when she was <unk> not coming the female on her own mhm mhm <unk> <unk> was her cousin a male cousin i'm i'm guessing that sort of the oh i think that would probably be fine yeah yeah i mean it's just like unchaperoned the problem [laughter] something like that i'm guessing yeah probably i probably make things easier huh [noise] or maybe even go with david to to his friend and from their call that you know when <unk> visiting someone else someone's lawyer yeah yeah i mean i think she would really like to see him and you know he was very sweet and you sort of one of these things that she sort of felt when she came up against the cultural wall i mean she sort of understood but i guess intellectually understood but emotionally didn't understand [laughter] yeah um which i think you also probably have a lot of those kinds of experiences um have 'em but did you send boxes um yes just three <unk> buy <unk> you know surf she's got <unk> <unk> to kill me or yes yes <unk> books and the others are you close <unk> saw <unk> whatever i don't know whatever forms you know she had to fill out for it but she did the right things and there's there's nothing new in their son that shouldn't be and it's too <unk> know under what <unk> she coming pardon did she get any special visa or just whatever <unk> no i think they said i mean she talked to them and whatever i mean she did whatever they told her first oh i know i think she talked to the counseling first they said yes she needed one then they said no she actually could get one in israel uh-huh uh-huh um so she just listen to what i mean she'd gotten to know the <unk> in um [noise] i'm i'm <unk> i know in in michigan <unk> and and talked with them talk with him something just did whatever he ended up thing mhm so um and she called me poor miriam called me yesterday morning i mean she had a great time she hadn't calls and i didn't say <unk> well yes now she is but i've been watching the weather france looks like she had very nice warm weather and friends the whole time yeah i think so i'm just spoke very very briefly but she said she had a really nice time but she decided um her friend didn't have time to meet her in the mountains <unk> she was going to go right to madrid was going to be an all night i'm train ride and then she found out plane costs the same thing so she decided to go by plane but she called me very distraught from the airport because i told her is gonna be two hundred dollars for her extra for her luggage because within europe i mean everybody told her like if she flew directly <unk> israel from the states she was allowed seventy kilos because you like in europe she was only allowed forty kilos then they told her within europe was only twenty five kilos so she was like er twenty kilos she was like twenty kilos over and and i just didn't know what to tell her to do i mean i mean she hadn't originally planned to fly you know just i guess it has to do with like this common market stuff now or whatever but i told her and talk to british airways who she flew over on i mean because <unk> you know and and just see and then i told her you know bag and cry and find some nice young man and smile at him and cry just say she doesn't have the money i mean ultimately you know ten years from now <unk> won't make a difference but that's a huge amount of money well that's that actually happened to me many years ago my food that <unk> real british airways oh wow well what else was air france who told her was going to be all this extra fish um and you know nobody i haven't heard from her since then but nobody was even out her game and you know this one guy said well he said i can not five kilos off the weight and i told her <unk> put on your coat and take your toiletries out you know anything that's heavy put them in your backpack but still she was just so i mean she just had no idea and she couldn't <unk> at that point because i guess because of terrorism fears they um have um you can only mail letters from the post office at the airport wait so she's got what she's what forty <unk> mm uh-huh yeah but she was really <unk> [laughter] but <unk> not forty pounds no forty <unk> <unk> no it was um you know it's too big of a duffel bag you know soft sided suitcase which are pretty big but she couldn't you know fairly much manage it but and then <unk> i think it's probably a little less by now because she was giving a couple of things to her friend in paris but you know makes you bought something you know the problem when she was already at the airport otherwise you would have males things or maybe she would have gone back to the train station or i don't know [laughter] um who isn't that <unk> those those places well the person actually the person she's visiting in um <unk> who she visited in paris is a friend of hers from ann arbor she knew that are but but she's actually a german young woman who's starting graduate school in paris um and i remember meeting her what's her name was so few she was very nice <unk> and the other person i'm in spain for guy she's visiting who um as it's not i mean he has a girlfriend he's gonna she's going to stay with his family but he's um [noise] he spent two years in this country um and went to her high school then as far as the doctor and she kept up you know telephone and writing communication now for nine years probably misses since high school yeah yeah well that's neat i've never seen each other since then oh that's neat yeah yeah so she was excited about that and his <unk> i remember meeting his mother ones who seem very nice mhm so that's nice yeah yeah i mean she did <unk> she was so upset about the the baggage stuff but she did say she had a great time and <unk> so i'm glad about that and um and i just had a i mean i'm fine but somebody hit my car to feel badly and had to be total way and done they take it to the other person but they said <unk> was close you know and try and tell who was live on i think he's gonna contestants so that's gonna be a pain [laughter] what happened well i was at a it was an area where they're like these two lanes merging and i was trying to turn left and i had stopped i was sort of entering a street and then almost immediately thereafter turning left and um i had stopped there was nobody coming i had pulled into the the turn lying had my turn signal aunt was going very very slowly and he passed me he came from behind me and passed me on the left and drove into me as i was turning but he said and you know what <unk> was passing when i'm farther over then you should have been <unk> and the other side already well see i i just don't know i mean just it's just very hard to tell from it was dark and it's just very hard to i had to move my car out of the street because i was so afraid somebody else would come along and <unk> you don't hit me 'cause it's kind of an intersection where you you sort of come around uh ben before you get to this <unk> um i think he was somewhat over and left him in the wrong way by the time he hit me but he said i just cut in front of him which i did not do but i may not have been a hundred percent in the turn line because i had come you know from the right and then you know had merged in from the right and there was almost immediately turning left but i know that i was not i mean i was at least you know i think i was at least half and probably more in the passing lane because before i pulled my car on the street cars were going by me on the right hand side although i know i was not in the right one <unk> but it's kind of a mess [laughter] a lot of damage in the car yeah yeah i think so i mean i don't happen to you know into your side where you are the <unk> oh yeah yeah but <unk> <unk> fortunately it was a little farther ahead than the where the drivers seat is it was like the front wheel and the front um like the bumper and stuff was torn off and you know <unk> we're hanging out but <unk> it may be more cosmetic i mean you know i mean it's obviously a lot of body work but it's possible it didn't affect the engine and i don't think <unk> bent anything but i can't tell because my door was able to open <unk> fine i think if it had sort of bent the card structurally i probably would have trouble closing the door but you know my car some new that one of the things that happens in this country's you can end up fighting with an insurance company even if they accept liability and pay they may want you to go to some <unk> junkie place to fix it that you know wouldn't do a good job and it really old car that'd be one thing but a car i plan to keep you know like nine more years they have to do good job <unk> <unk> so that's a pain [laughter] i didn't tell miriam it'd happened the night before and i just thought yeah i don't need to tell her that <unk> [laughter] and i really am fine so i mean notice heard but it's kind of you know but otherwise i'm doing so [laughter] so are the how are the kids on the general <unk> was just think it's like <unk> miriam <unk> this whole business of how we're going to be meeting exactly yeah it's still <unk> how many <unk> i don't i can't let you <unk> ever flight number from spain <unk> israel <unk> do you want to give it to make sure you know find someplace that the um [noise] it's on oh no different at all it's iberia yeah i'm madrid to tel aviv <unk> october twenty fourth flight three seven nine six or seven and i'm <unk> i'm supposed to be coming in i think that for right oh let's see arrived tel aviv sixteen o five is that for <unk> for <unk> [laughter] i don't i don't think <unk> yeah okay because <unk> the whole thing is that a lot of depends on whether her planes coming in on time or not because i'm <unk> i'm flying to tel aviv right and i would only be reaching the tel aviv i'm <unk> not the been growing there put the other <unk> i'm coming in at four thirty now there's a there's an <unk> airport buses there's one for forty five at five thirty <unk> i don't think i'll make the fourth <unk> fine mhm now five thirty already i mean means i'm at the airport a quarter sick which means she maybe and her <unk> her direction also are for forty five <unk> five thirty i doubt she was having to go through customs i should try to make the fourth <unk> and we're only make the five thirty right right so the question is what i do i go to the <unk> you know it seems to make more sense in for her to just come out <unk> and i will wait but i'm not you know i told her <unk> try to call wasn't there for the factory <unk> you know i don't know <unk> you know <unk> it's a problem how we're going to be able to yeah i mean she definitely supposed to call i didn't think <unk> <unk> okay 'cause i think i've spoken to you after she had spoken to you and i thought it's just like if it was like some change or you knew was going to be late or something so i'm not sure if she's planning to call see 'cause i'm <unk> <unk> well the thing is i don't i mean i don't see any way that i will be there i don't think i'll be able to make it there yeah yeah right <unk> <unk> do you want me to i mean i could pay you back for although um i don't think she could call you well easily but i have the number where she's staying in spain and her parents his parents <unk> english <unk> don't maybe i could do it and just tell her <unk> <unk> exactly when these yeah <unk> because i told her that i will <unk> you know for not that i was saying that then i'll you know wait for <unk> for when did you get you know give me the number then okay there last name is postal p. o. t. o. p. p. o. v. oh okay i'm his first name is taco i don't know the parents names <unk> closer friends yeah that's her friend okay the the father and casey happens happens to answer the doctor [laughter] okay um their phone number is well zero one one um three for one <unk> five five one mhm eight nine eight one eight nine eight <unk> yeah nothing madrid there's no faxed him <unk> [laughter] you know they might i mean i don't know yeah i mean he is a doctor i'm you know it's possible he does but <unk> doesn't know that if he does the problem with her is that she just doesn't have a good way to call from you know from somebody else's house right right but that one is sort of international type calling card thing [noise] um well she did um but it's like unbelievable expensive really yeah it's like two dollars a minute and that's not what i pay normally oh really wow what <unk> <unk> i think i pay five dollars for three minutes or something yeah oh well that yeah well that's that's <unk> i mean i pay here anywhere between one and two dollars <unk> depending on the time of day but when the good time which i almost never call and it's only a dollar a minute uh-huh i'm <unk> i mean that might be good to try and just directly you know tell her that yeah because he's a little bit anxious to about you know what happens if you know we both thought of what happens if you're each on a bus going the opposite <unk> exactly [laughter] to be good if you've got <unk> yes <unk> <unk> it seems like almost because like for some reason i do manage to catch the full forty five bus then there's no problem because i'll be there will be for her mhm i'd be like five mhm and there's no way she'll make the for forty five butts right now i mean she's also as possible that she could <unk> not make the five so that's sort of things i can <unk> i'm <unk> see i don't even know that anybody could pager because like when i came back it took me almost three hours to get out of the airport oh god it was planned it together g. there was um one jumbled <unk> and then i was an hour early and two others one hour late <unk> and it was just total <unk> yeah i mean i was three thirty i was out about six o'clock god now she's got a whole bunch of junk and i'm sure you know probably even though it's a kind of work

used to be very like economically based like it was all just like create workers or the side of the factory model thing and all these things are coming out and even like the wharton type people you know people that i would think would be like more eric's wavelength that aren't all happy happy happy for the world etcetera and even they were like backing <unk> sweet and i'm like i wish eric could because this is the one argument used their support you might even accept these people's support what was what was what was there you know i don't remember exactly what we're talking about um about

than like a week or two you looking any prospects are now on i think that interview oh that'd be yeah i think so that's a big step yeah i mean he's definitely like getting more into the looking for a job mode kind of thing that he's been in it for a while there's like today like he's not really into it out and you would do that and then he'll be successful you might you know where he just doesn't have <unk> doesn't have the first step is never good internship <unk> work harder summer right <unk> first he needs to settle for his first job and so i don't know if i'm if you talk to him yeah <unk> i don't want to preach to him but i definitely learned over here that before you get into marketing you have to first two sails necessarily i've friends in new york doing advertising marketing and she's outlet but they had internships have some time internship where they did sales or something like that <unk> advertising internship where i guess i kind of had their own accounts whatever <unk>

it take my blood pressure and check my urine i think yeah i'm like who the hell <unk> [laughter] <unk> i'm going to find someone <unk> well we um when i when i had tyson we had something called share care because well you said that you don't have <unk> private it's all public there isn't yeah there is no such thing as private here yeah so i had i paid for a private doctor and um if i had private health insurance i could have had 'em but i paid for him and um he would just do most of my checkups towards the end like he did it at twenty weeks and then like a twenty eight weeks and then um as of about i think the last month i had to see him once a week yeah now i almost could've bagged those visits and and it's a good thing he came to harvey bay doesn't he doesn't come here anymore now the the only obstetrician that we have private obstetrician that we haven't town is only an mayorborough and he's <unk> which is a half hour away and you basically just sit in the office and you come in and they just take <unk> blood pressure and they talk she how you going into my feel around the baby a little bit and there's no internal exam of course and then that's it i mean i could go to my doctor and did the same some a little bit torn as to how to go next time as far as i'm <unk> <unk> you know going private at all yeah i would be so much different if i had a baby again i mean well we do plan actually on having more than one but <unk> you know i just i mean i just thought it would be so different i mean i i find that i don't need to see the doctor i have no desire to see the doctor you know yeah <unk> you <unk> you get you get a bit afraid you know like i i was quite <unk> you know is always good with my visits and did my visits and and i sort of realized that uh i i don't think i actually did my followup with doctor stokes because oh no i did one follow up but i had to do another one i just didn't show up to that one because this is ridiculous at that point <unk> the the followup that he's told me after i had the baby was has the baby how are you going fine well you're that's it you know they you act or does he make sure that the baby's head down <unk> takes my blood pressure and that's it you know and it's like you know by the time you've been pregnant for you know x number of months you're the one who's going to know whether there's something wrong more than the yes er i know so you know it's all up to movement and the baby stops moving then you know you don't call it the doctor you go straight to the hospital absolutely so [noise] yes and that's the scary thing isn't it oh my god i know i hate it when he stops moving yeah actually i was pretty bad too because um i had you know you have to keep register of the um they don't make us do that really all you had account and um i just get really lazy some days and just sort of you know lie on the sheet how many [laughter] well it must have you too because i know like i said to my computer all day long

receiving letter and the birthday card <unk> finished work last week i'm officially on maternity leave [laughter] oh yes yes yes i have to get my life totally organized and complete the <unk> that's been growing for the last twelve months [laughter] on top of all that i'm tired i get up at ten ten a._m. to our nap after lunch i forgot about all this <unk> that's great isn't that good at the same time you were as i am now that's exactly right oh wow what else to say i think that's normal pregnancy thing do you believe that i'm going to be a parent within one month that's the end of the letter [laughter] never going <unk> far enough well the big one for janice david oldest the twentieth [noise] that that i think that was one after i had a fight with craig somebody about seeing a counselor on it [laughter] and here's a deer diane letter um maybe and it starts off maybe this letter will get mailed [laughter] ask you did you guys um circumcised tyson or not no oh yeah you did it yeah we got into a huge fight about that [noise] no it's not the thing here oh yeah well you know if i wasn't jewish i wouldn't i mean it's totally it's totally not a a like it's totally not medically indicated it's stupid to do unless you're doing it for religious reasons yes but we got into a huge fight about that does he wanted <unk> didn't want <unk> didn't want to because there's really no reason to do or yeah you know like if you're gonna raise them as a jew he'll have to be any way that <unk> yeah but you don't know what we're gonna do about all that are you guys the same religion [noise] now he's anglican and i'm catholic uh-huh does that create problems like those are pretty different aren't they and so i think well it's just that the the <unk> allowed divorce [laughter] they're very <unk> it's it's a casual catholicism [laughter] but um the church um i think the principals are pretty similar um [noise] we haven't <unk> the only <unk> actually <unk> we're going to um we're gonna make things easier in ourselves where we're going to enroll tyson in a a a christian school so that um we would have to um sort of participate in a community or in the um the church community uh-huh through him so it will sort of allow us to start participating and get us into into it because we won't do it on room <unk> yeah i understand that so they're they're a couple of schools as far as the the um the public schools anyway and in in the bay pretty pretty <unk> <unk> and <unk> apparently the education just okay but discipline <unk> really pretty horrible and um there there is just recently busy <unk> college that's been built and it's just absolutely sapir education we requested information starts from grade one starts actually from preschool so so he can go in and about the age of three or four oh four years old and absolute excellent <unk> in education and i'm <unk> uh and sports and also community service like even by like grade nine they have to participate in some sort of community service whether it be through a military or um in hospital or something they have to you know they have to be active in the community too so the requirements are really high and and um the education's fairly expensive but but we feel that that's gonna be the best thing for him <unk> but 'cause otherwise we were not churchgoers we don't do anything with the church huh yeah i don't know what we're gonna do they you know the schools here it's really weird they don't have non religious schools here oh really public schools are religious schools oh wow like totally them right now it's mainly catholic isn't yes oh yes or chemical to catholic school there's just no question about that because <unk> there's not a jewish school well there there are jewish schools but we're not um but we thought we would do is that the kid would go to catholic school <unk> and then you know and <unk> and then i'd enroll them in like jewish religious training or whatever you know <unk> hebrew school or something like that <unk> yeah but then you know but then it's the truth that you <unk> it's the truth you have to make the commitment too you can't just enroll your edited <unk> kid to a <unk> you know do it on his own and you're not absolutely hate definitely takes family guns 'cause especially was a bit of a an awakening especially when <unk> requested information from the school i got this whole package on the goals of the school with the children's education and and um [noise] there um what do you call <unk> their mission statement and old you know <unk> and this and what's expected a child and what's expected the parents and it was like whoa wow you know we're gonna have to participate [laughter] but that was good too because i realize you know um maybe we need something like that yeah i have a friend and you know she goes to church all the time and stuff and uh she's not like um and and she tells me some of the stuff that like the churches done for her and i mean i'm really not into the religious aspect of it at all like <unk> i'm really not into the whole you know jesus christ <unk> obviously because i'm jewish right yeah but like the whole community the part of her meanness you know part of this community is like totally great well that's yeah that that is a nice part of it actually and also um [noise] well you're fortunate their things private <unk> well i guess the real christian christian schools because i think the <unk> the quality of um not just the education but <unk> you know personal education the child because um that's one thing led to that since <unk> was in college it's come in and families that i know that that have sent their children going from the public system onto this some <unk> the end <unk> college whether they be from a religious family or not send the children have just become so altruistic you know they have genuine concern for their other classmates and and um they also think it's great because now now i'm their their education is not disruptive you know <unk> there's not other children creating problem no tests and everybody is very respectful of each other and that's really nice yeah i mean i have i have kids that i see here in the office that you know the the reason why they ran is because they're hurting themselves because kids are doing mean things to them in school the pulling chairs out from under them nothing them over pushing them over yeah it's it's horrible it's just really horrible just rough has <unk> rough housing so [noise] but you know it's it's funny when you start thinking about these things <unk> and you start taking this really responsible rule and [laughter] my child's education it'd be like what'd you do about the baptism and stuff did you have any problems with that 'cause he's english <unk> did they say anything or no i'm actually cousins on anything in particular so we don't but i'm being <unk> being like you know oh no no problem little did you have to talk to the priest first or you had to go for an interview 'cause we had it done you know we had done it so yeah i remember yeah and you know there was absolutely no problem nothing mhm and and and i would still think that that <unk> they would be considered injured denominational you know marriage as opposed to you know like definitely the difference between <unk> catholicism in judaism but i don't think it makes a difference <unk> <unk> as long as there's <unk> there is a difference they just ask you um you know how do you wanna raise your child i think they asked me that they might not <unk> now they were just they would all they took for granted was that oh he's going to be baptized and the catholic church so they obviously gave us our responsibilities from the catholic point of view yeah yeah 'cause we didn't know what we're gonna do about that yeah we haven't decided because i'm like from what i understood having a baptism is like a promise to the church that you're going to raise the child is a catholic and that jesus christ is you know the lord which is i mean it's okay it would be okay for norm's make that promise right <unk> yeah i i certainly couldn't make that promise actually that that was an issue that i remember that now yes that was an issue and then the issue was is that the the uh unfortunately we did the baptism for <unk> for ritual uh-huh you know it was basically for family okay in a ritual and also almost like tyson's coming out and party <unk> yeah <unk> i'm a true symbolism for us because we accepted that that tyson would be baptized and um and he would eventually have a christian education but there was no promise to the catholic church in our book [laughter] we cross your fingers jury met her heart up [laughter] and it was the <unk> but <unk> but it was definitely an issue because <unk> we had to think well why are we doing this so we'd being true to ourselves why are we doing it but we didn't use it for several reasons you know it was important to my parents were your dad was born <unk> inlaws too yes and and we're comfortable with that you know <unk> it was fine <unk> very comfortable with that and it only meant to us that <unk> was going to have a christian education that was it okay yeah well we have to rude around and you know going to talk to the priest and stuff like i called up or rabbi and i'm like you know well what happens if we have like a jewish naming ceremony i'm like you know i'm like what does that mean to have a jewish naming ceremony you know because i was trying i was trying to figure out like i know what it means to have a baptism right i mean it's a promise i was trying <unk> what does it mean to have a jewish naming ceremony right that's right and them and the rabbis like well you know if you're jewish her baby's jewish yes i'm like i'm like yeah well i understand that that's the way that you know that's what the jews leave i'm like but what does that mean that doesn't make <unk> yeah i mean i'm i'm making a promise to you know the jewish religion that i'm you know that this child's going to be a jewish <unk> <unk> i can't make that promised because you know they'll probably go to catholic school too and the guy's like well if you're jewish the baby [laughter] but yeah he had a real jewish x. [laughter] yeah you know so [laughter] he was a real forceful rabbi <unk> well if you're jewish the baby's jewish you know there's no question [laughter] oh i know it was pretty funny well you know things things change over a period of time to you know like you know certainly in the nineties yeah people that they they mixed things they mix and match [laughter] as far as their religion is concerned how are you going to raise a child [noise] so if you if you're not so keen on well let's talk about this and let's figure out you know what does it mean if if he's going through this naming ceremony and all he sticks to his dog <unk> and you're not supportive of that well then you still want to do your own thing anyway well you know <unk> should i should i go through both ceremonies or or you know what i i feel sell you the truth a lot of the stuff is actually crap anyway because technically child should decide later on for themselves if they want to be baptized yeah yeah that's the way the um the mennonite to do it oh a friend who the mennonite and they don't believe in baptized and the baby they baptized as an adult i think that that's probably more reasonable <unk> you know it's the child <unk> i mean it's it's the person's decision rather than the parents now the catholics get into the bit of the guilt trip because the first thing the reason why you have to have your child baptized it's not just for the promise of education but it's like if the child dies yeah i know the child will go to heaven [laughter] that's true well that's exactly that's another reason for your for going for the old baptism bottle [laughter] it'd be while they're going to be they're going to be monitoring this focus [laughter] the philosophers [laughter] bathroom degree in science you should ask them for the tape [laughter] we remember this or did you hear so many i mean my mother in law gave it a little lecture and then there's this other guy and he was just telling us like i couldn't believe someone actually say this to us but he's going well it's a friend of ours you know why you really have to pick one religion because you know you can't raise the kid in both religions because they're just going to get to confused and they're going to have an identity <unk> all <unk> [laughter] wait till you have the baby i mean this is you know religion is an important issue <unk> they have the baby all the different ways are you going to be told about everything now nursing mother's will say the baby <unk> all the baby needs <unk> that's it only breast milk you mother in law's gonna say i'll get the baby bottle [laughter] give it the baby <unk> <unk> my mother in law was on the baby's need water baby <unk> and my mother in law was dead set against breastfeeding she didn't think it was natural [laughter] useful thankyou natural
