and um and so and i've just been plunged into the depth of despair for the past twenty four hours over the prime sorry well that's okay actually i think that part of it has to do with my speaking with attending all about it who's not sitting in on the class and so the more widespread in liberal parameters of the project on he's not aware of and so i've been discussing with him you know whether it's going to work as a project or not and he tends to be on the negative whereas we're talking with my class tends to be mhm towards the positive and i don't know i just frustrating yeah i'm going through these [noise] i have one ecstasy and many deaths in my in my life but the great thing is if i finish this project than i can go back to my ecstasy project would keep me happy as long as i can pretend it's the only thing i have to do good [laughter] have you sent along that i spend them yet i'm i i yeah the woman i'm working with on this project is really excited about them so in that case i will

laws and harvard law buys so i'm <unk> <unk> that's an interesting question so she might want to um check into that just but if it's just uh then again if it's just the <unk> it's been so list and you know <unk> she could have found it anywhere and go chase down the articles herself yeah [noise] so how many more about you besides the fact that you're ill and i want you to get better [laughter] i couldn't do that [noise] um let's see what else about me i'm cooking brunch this term it's really fun <unk> made <unk> for a hundred and fifty last weekend wow there's nothing quite like <unk> two hundred and fifty exit scramble i'm [noise] i'm really panicked about this moving gig and how much it's gonna cause yeah moving like what what the <unk> gonna cost <unk> yeah that out and what first left and security's going to be <unk> if we're even going to be able to find an apartment anyway and what we're gonna do if we can't find an apartment and um you name it i'm probably panicking about it we'll have you checked into those were about a apartment buildings in san francisco there all <unk> no my first year i think among holyoke these rumors flooded around that sounds nice <unk> familiar to me but i had forgotten those yeah that's an interesting thought i don't think we could sell heather on it but it might be worth a try no but it might be some place to stay until you find some place where we have actually on line on some temporary residences because the six week fellowship that she's applying for attracts people from all over the place and <unk> and they sent out information a temporary housing [laughter] that is convenient to their program so yeah um we may go that route for the the short call if we need to do anything for the short haul we're really hoping we don't need to well yeah i remember this particular situation for me to sit and wait [laughter] yeah [laughter] oh oh we're panicked but yeah and you will survive it though that's what they told me [noise] um i applied for two jobs and now that my reality for the first time last week which was not as big <unk> thought it was gonna be uh-huh i mean i am feeling all this fear i compiled and the last job <unk> but it was still easier to mail out the rest of my like my resume better this time for all right yeah i've had for two positions one i really don't think i want and <unk> i'd love to have <unk> um [noise] and the <unk> the one that i'd love to have peace thirty four and oh well i can't figure out how it could be qualified to make thirty four [laughter] i mean i i know i'm worth that much any more but <unk> um i can't imagine why anyone would want to pay a social worker with my little experience <unk> much well are they advertising for that level of well but that's the thing there was nothing in the job description that i couldn't do <unk> mean i'm in fact quite well suited to do most of it so if they want to pay me thirty for to do it i won't say no tell me about it what kind of job <unk> <unk> it's a program associate position would be all summers association and san francisco ooh involving some care coordination um [noise] and um some speaking like training professionals educating professionals about off <unk> assume on some evenings and weekends [noise] staffing volunteer support that they weren't much more specific than stuff and <unk> [noise] hey you know i'd probably have to wear a suit but we're <unk> for your for thirty you looked really nice and the seat you got <unk> interviewing you and i think that i know enough more about clothing now that i could find more comfortable suit [laughter] i fully recommend long ones but then again you are to long skirt type yes i am much more <unk> well i mean like <unk> yes i am yes the longer the better actually i'm trying to think if i but i guess i guess most of the <unk> i've seen you wearing have been long they've just been in a very different you just haven't seen <unk> through and probably yeah [noise] um you could always with address from my wedding [laughter] i get to work [laughter] maybe do a social event um actually i was thinking more like parents suits and stuff yeah yeah and the way so yeah i'm on the other one is with <unk> lutheran social services doing case management with h._i._v. positive poop <unk> which i could do but i don't really want to do yeah more because they don't want to do 'em do um gives management yeah anything else <unk> refund working with 'em and eats <unk> organization again so [noise] you do new we'll see what happens well um yeah [noise] so do you like not email or what's the deal [noise] do <unk> you haven't gotten my email or is it just like i haven't had time to eat right around the letter <unk> you you haven't had time to write <unk> letter i'm sure <unk> i'm i've gotten <unk> i haven't gotten one for a couple of weeks ago yeah i'm sorry i don't know what's wrong with <unk> i like okay no problem i just wanted to make sure that a coping with life thing it's a little yeah like you mean there's something i have to do besides books like eating has been a problem <unk> oh washing dishes there's definitely been a problem sleeping sleeping is not a problem okay partially helped by the fact that a i can't sleep and be matches on every night at ten thirty [laughter] so you go to sleep [laughter] yeah i get into bed turn on match watching good asleep good so i'm probably getting a lot more sleep and most people okay sleeping is good eating is important eating is important i'm having a lot of trouble with that <unk> really getting to the grocery store having a hard time eating alone yeah and see the depression and older people all the time yeah well actually i can say that this in particular is not <unk> it can cause depression but this in particular is not a matter of depression who had a matter of i've never lived alone i'm very used to cooking for two when i cook yeah um when i came home from work in japan beer at midnight i knew that intel whatever dad and i had to go to work the next morning i didn't have to deal with work right you know student getting yeah different and it's really difficult because you can never draw a line that's where i'm living in a co-op yeah i need actually i'm really wishing in a lot of ways <unk> well i love where i'm living <unk> snow not complaining right and a lot of ways i'm wishing i live in a dorm for the first semester just tell them that that know got back right um because i mean when it comes down to you know i can take forty five minutes <unk> peel vegetables and cut them up and do whatever to them or i can study right except i mean i know i know how hard that is mhm um and i i knew i would do that if i were a student and [noise] and living and having to feed myself but um i also didn't in korea i did it with money interestingly enough it was like no i'm not going to you know by this food because they need to save the money and i mean it was getting ridiculous here and eat the food you have to do it yeah not optional will <unk> i mean it's not that i'm missing meals that okay not eating healthy food i'm like <unk> the health the end of my eating spectrum is my usual dinner which is well let's see <unk> i have some summer squash i have some dried cranberry have some rice and i have an onion cool what i'm going to do is i'm going to chop all of it up stir fry it and put water and <unk> wait till the races done <unk> part of it but the rest of the refrigerator and eat at night <unk> makes sense yeah i'm <unk> <unk> that's <unk> however supposing that i've had time to go grocery shopping right which <unk> anyway the other thing is that is just no fun to cook for one person i know and what the hell do you do you eat [laughter] i know [laughter] i mean i started eating on the bed which is something i tried not to do sitting on the bed eating watching television i like i try to avoid it but i can't yeah [noise] um anyway so that's like the big the big thing that i'm looking forward to nathaniel coming <unk> well no that's not the bakery [laughter] but that's one of the thing yeah it helps when does he'll be back december systems or when he first mm yeah [noise] but that's not a date for public consumption no no i'm i'll be back the eighteenth [noise] and i'll be there till the third [noise] you're kidding know are we talking <unk> a windfall i can't even speak english oh my god i get all my idioms wrong that's okay [laughter] this is the land for him [laughter] it's like one <unk> somebody from is a good i'm not coming <unk> boat <unk> him and then you'll two more people on the east coast and boom we're going to go right into the ocean [laughter] wait [laughter] um [laughter] god like english still sucks so badly i just can't get it back like my idiomatic cents it's just come and i know i remember i nobody's really <unk> <unk> the place that it's really been affecting me is i can't keep up in class taking notes <unk> and the <unk> uh like look i'll be you know looking up at the professor and he'll say something my mind will process it looked down to write my note and the words will be gone oh i hate that and i'll be like it starts with <unk> i know what <unk> and <unk> miss you know like a good minute if the lectures i'm like staring well no probably fifteen seconds but what happens <unk> fifteen seconds you sitting there staring at the paper trying to you know semi <unk> i've actually started recording one of my lectures yeah every class i mean i can't do it for all of them but [noise] the one class that i'm turning out to really enjoy [laughter] record lectures he's also the most <unk> like well [laughter] close to the monster pick up the lecture [noise] um i don't know that's a summary of my life [laughter] so it's only um a little over two weeks i think that i'll be there but we'll find time yes maybe you guys can come out <unk> yeah yeah 'cause we've got i mean i have chinese no my chinese classes don't start until like the day you leave so we'll we'll definitely figured out we're going to be out of town from the thirty thirtieth to the first <unk> where you go in new hampshire good for you yeah no kidding [laughter] so you have your reservation i have my <unk> one yes no getting um and that my client who i brought here mhm um last year is coming um well the mother mhm and i'm not sure which family members i hope that dad <unk> gosh i like him a lot i like both of them so much um they're coming and they're going to be here well if i come to visit you that will make it easier to i can see them at the same time when are they going to be um well she goes to wilston northampton uh-huh <unk> she said i'm the mom i just spoke to her a few minutes actually <unk> as far as her when you tried to call 'em been busy and i [laughter] um i think she said <unk> they're coming maybe on the twenty ninth and i told them if they needed any help um you know i i kind of i can't make any <unk> the twenty ninth until i know mhm <unk> were but basically i mean heck it might turn out that you know if they find to boston i can drive them to western out to western mass and visit you on our way to new hampshire [noise] well [laughter] i don't know i want you for more than a couple of hours yeah no no i'm talking about more than a couple of korean paula well also be with us for christmas <unk> really anywhere almost anywhere in the whole time frame i'm home you know could come out <unk> okay yes is there any time that's better than any other well christmas day probably wouldn't be the <unk> yeah but it wouldn't be that bad yeah i'm just trying to think i <unk> cory usually the way they have a sleeping is korean me in my room and paula in the back room but we have put paula in the living room [noise] so actually there would be room for all of us to be there yet but she shouldn't be kicked out for no i mean paula sometimes sleeps in the living room i think it maybe i'm more comfortable mattress i mean i wouldn't be kicking her out that's paula's normal place to sleep when she's okay well um so i never really doesn't matter i guess okay <unk> my schedules don't want to <unk> to christmas so [laughter] um [laughter] well that's probably not the best day i have to see you know how nathaniel's feeling absolute about being social <unk> but i know he's very much would of course like to see you um i mean that just depends like if we come before christmas or after [laughter] mhm um what i could definitely see happening is a post christmas pre new hampshire okay visit somebody like the twenty six two the morning <unk> the twenty ninth or be so lovely or something like that would be so lovely yeah i could just play <unk> we could just play and all three of us will need to do so [laughter] yeah you're right [laughter] oh i'm so glad i'm getting <unk> soon as i know like a treat or what are you in august have this moving back to this continent thing has it's really does it really does pluses [noise] oh yeah it's gonna be good yeah so oh yeah like another thing i don't know how <unk> thirty minutes is not something like drop on you but [noise] and it's not like i'm thinking about doing it right now yeah there's a story about what i am thinking about doing i remarried no [laughter] oh god no [laughter] i'm having major baby pangs wait is this what you're going to drop on me or well i mean it's not this is the thing that i'm not going to do like tomorrow but okay um but at some point when i'm somewhat more established i mean for so long i'm sure i didn't want to be a mother i now i really do i think i want to have a baby and like be a mom [laughter] great yeah so and we had a baby before i do every time i said oh i don't know if it'll be before you everytime i see how they're says i'm not really speak <unk> thought your [laughter] i'm not sure where do you think about it tomorrow but you know <unk> just something i'm thinking about and i think i want to do and the other night she said you know i think i might want to be bombed so wow <unk> mom and all like where we're going to find the dads [laughter] yeah <unk> that's a problem could be yeah which [noise] but but i don't know i mean it would be interesting if my brother were willing to donate for i'm heather yeah 'cause then it would be it would have some our blood god and some mcnealy blood but she doesn't have any acceptable male relatives [laughter] [noise] so [noise] wow yeah so there's that and um but that's not like you know news at the moment or anything that's just something i'm thinking about that i want to know [noise] and um the other thing is i've been thinking about and i i think i've pretty much just decided not to do it but i was thinking about being an egg donor actually the local wow reproductive medicine clinic [noise] um [noise] largely because it paid fifteen hundred dollars [laughter] but i went in for the preliminary exam um an interview that just yesterday and aside from it sounded kind of scary i mean i could probably do scary for fifteen hundred dollars um it's like a two to three months process which i don't have <unk> so so but i did find out that i have acceptably positioned ovaries and um so you know maybe at some point in the future kind of sucks though the fifteen hundred dollars to come in handy well there's always say francisco right right i figure it's probably not exactly a novelty out there so that's something i may do at some point in the future <unk> on my way home on the bus i'm thinking i'm like selling my body here they call it oocyte donation but the <unk> fifteen hundred dollars to do it so that really donation that's very interesting it is interesting it's very interesting process really really yeah i mean they explained like how they use the hormones to like turn off your ovaries and then overstimulate them and how they harvest the <unk> not exactly a pleasant sounding experience yeah i i kind of heard something about that <unk> know <unk> it's really interesting my ovaries on the little screen and oh it didn't hurt [laughter] easier than about look [noise] oh god i have to go in and have one of the [laughter] um i haven't had one in over a year no usually have them every august yeah have 'em in the spring <unk> sorry didn't mean to bring up a bad thing now that's okay i've been meaning to do it for two weeks <unk> when i have the time you know so true [noise] so so becker sounding better to me [noise] yeah actually she's coming to see me again oh good yeah she's coming next week so you're not coming out to see me huh huh this this fall you're not coming out to see i i'm sorry [laughter] the last time we argue you thought you might i know i thought i'd love to but i think i think there's probably i oh my god okay does [laughter] so it's okay see part of what <unk> see i have this big paper that i'm really excited about that i'm going to do about ten times too much work on a good sign because that means that i'm going like <unk> like as well as i did um on holy right um that i i just actually i don't know like if i'm going to do good job on it but i'm really excited about it um that's gonna like too much time as possible top december sixth and i'm also having from the time becker comes <unk> becker comes for one weekend in november and then my parent my mom comes something like the twelfth <unk> or something for thanksgiving oh my god i don't know she's going for some ungodly long time and then you <unk> is your dad coming out to yeah he he's coming out the morning and thanksgiving here my brother will arrive and that they'll only in the day after all of them leave ursula it's coming <unk> coming so november is like oh my god i mean in a way it's really good because it will get me to win that they don't get <unk> this month it's been so long you have never experienced such a long month in my life <unk> you mean july was like that for me yeah [noise] yeah i'm in in a way i mean november will fly it scenes and after that i can tell myself you know well summer's here it means nathaniel coming home now it's right and i might feel safe myself that way for twenty one days sure um but <unk> but <unk> on the other hadn't really scared because i have all this work that <unk> the main thing is this anthro class and i'm having trouble with um you know i take two uh about a month just in the writing over twenty page paper not talking about any of the research right and <unk> this <unk> this anthro class has this uh paper that's due on monday <unk> five page paper twenty page paper in a final take 'em exam which seems a little heavy but anyway um does seem rather heavy yeah the thing is that the the papers are cumulative and away so i can start on the twenty page paper until after i turned the five page paper which <unk> scaring the shit out of me beyond that the day after that paper is do i have my take on final for my law class due and i hate to i mean this is like completely different from the whole discussion that you will <unk> will never admit to my parents who felt i should take the sociology class this <unk> i would write to take the law class for the reasons that i was considering <unk> but my mind is not interacting with that information [laughter] like it's not that i don't understand it it's just like my mind is not picking up and saying oh this is interesting what about this and this and this is like nothing's happened <unk> didn't want <unk> besides that i managed to make these stupidest comments of the year every time i open my mouth and that class <unk> hate that so i just sit in the back <unk> actually in the front row which is awful because then if you like <unk> they're all thinking i'm stupid and i it's really weird because i think people must because the way people sit i am isolated like no one ever sits in the room <unk> i'm like oh my god i'm a law school leper <unk> you're you're taking a class and you're not a law student i mean nobody really knows you probably all know each other yeah anyway i'm not that the heat utah shit i know it's just that i read that class and right now i'm reading the answer class which <unk> hopefully just this week i don't know but so i have these two other big things do but the good thing about this is the law class is going to be done by the time that they don't get home <unk> potentially the take home final is given to us in the last day of class um which is when the papers do which is that basically they're two days after after my last final after i'm done with everything for the <unk> break part and tell them that said you'll comes home yet so if i can like get a significant portion of it take i'm finally <unk> first draft of the taken final for anthro done and then that only leaves two classes and um and you know harvard business like two week reading that two weeks <unk> break than two week reading period than two week exam period and all right so i have which means that i have six weeks where in other cases i would be in china yeah but no they say well it's really nice because it's going to be like every third day through this time so you have to stay here [noise] um the chinese final so and the thing comes on the twenty first the chinese finals on the eight the let's be realistic except for the fact that i have to keep this to my mind it's not like i'm going to study straight through for this chinese i mean it's tiny cumulative you learn it you know only so much you can do with language if you don't understand <unk> yes [noise] um and then my history <unk> the only thing left and it's like on the twenty sixth of january something and he's going to take a lotta times [noise] a lot of work but hey not 'til a couple of weeks before <unk> yeah well no it's not that i mean i can spread it out well i don't know we'll see how could i end up being diligent but um but you have a break yes you still can't spend like three weeks all right [laughter] right so you could but you'd probably explode and then what would be the <unk> yeah um so i think only for three weeks old actually remember some of it past the second week of next semester [laughter] [laughter] but anyway it looks like all the time to spend with daniel which is nice that is nice yeah but the point of this whole saga is that things are a little tense actually i'm surprisingly relaxed and taking all of this an emotional stride except my depression this morning um [noise] but but just like time wise none of the people i wanted to see and spend time with <unk> you how <unk> you know her she's in she's with me oh yeah yeah like <unk> [laughter] i'm like walking across the street and harvard square the hero honk and she goes like driving by my god this is a woman who i want to get to know more than almost any one i can think of it and i haven't even had time to call her and that happened like two weeks i don't know she was out there who yeah i knew he was here and i hadn't called her and <unk> saw her and i haven't called her and she has no way to find me and i know how to find her and then just feel embarrassed [laughter] no i still don't have <unk> phone number speaking of people so you don't have time to get in touch with but um she does have your so i don't think she'll call you she probably has <unk> <unk> yeah [noise] yeah i just figured at least you guys <unk> like kind of run into each other at some point <unk> least you'll know each other is there [laughter] yeah that is good houses <unk> he seems to be well actually this weekend he's in osaka he is then that <unk> he's into soccer <unk> teaching the osaka government how to huston international conference wow yeah dude yeah he's like training training people [laughter] it's like <unk> like if a chinese delegate if he's <unk> english nor japanese comes up screaming at you because they didn't get a badge to get in what do you do [laughter] how'd you find out what they want and how do you deal with it [laughter] oh very good [laughter] these <unk> these are job skills little transfer yeah no kidding other things are going well with larry well that's good and have been maybe for even like two months so of course shawn also got fired yeah <unk> yeah you mentioned that kinda sucks [noise] yeah well it has its good points and bad points personally it's horrible because we like <unk> very much but [noise] i don't know <unk> <unk> it's too <unk> <unk> yeah me too that's where i'm having physical problems i'm getting all these horrible back <unk> because i'm not used to sleeping <unk> oh i know was poor me wonder if you get <unk> current from being used to being alone what's interesting that makes sense that and the fact that i carry about seventy

they were wow [noise] yeah well i thought so too and when <unk> called and told me about it i was in the library and i went running around everybody here's your chance because he's that you could get one within the united states for half an hour and then you could get one <unk> anywhere outside the united states but um you had to make sure that it was the right kind of speech you know for him i

you don't care about everybody <unk> nobody else finds out about it [laughter] and our life we can talk about just about anything <unk> i think it's the c._i._a. found out that i was living in mexico and so they're asking me to call all these <unk> well where did you find what is this where you can spend some time talking about this little tape it linguistic data company mhm and ah out of the university it's wonderful to hear your voice <unk> it is so weird [laughter] that's what i said i said this i'm i'm teaching english language school you're adult language school yeah it's just this notice up there that said you know call for free blah blah blah blah <unk> another country but it has to be too native american speaker's okay and so she says well yeah you have to call people mexico but they have to be americans you know someone who's <unk> i wouldn't do it [laughter] what does it does it matter if i'm horse i mean is that is that well cancelled <unk> as you uh you know don't change your accent [laughter] as long as i'm audible [laughter] oh lord will <unk> will tell we'll talks what what what'd you can say say see well anyway <unk> well i'm teaching our time it's a part-time temporary job uh-huh which is a lot of fun i'm teaching this guy a businessman from mexico was up here and you know has too much money and those taking english classes in the morning and doing some audit the i._r._s. is doing an added on his company up here in in the afternoon so interesting so so you're you're working for a company yeah i'm working for a language um a place called the international horizons it's a language school huh and so um so it's only parttime all they put <unk> this is not through them no this is able to dancing you sauna built him bulletin board yeah it's just something they had up there was something <unk> and <unk> that's <unk> [laughter] we're gonna set off immediately click [laughter] so how is it i mean are you happy <unk> yes and no i mean i i i am basically real happy except that i haven't found the ideal job yet which is <unk> i have something in language yeah i haven't found a job that pays what i'm on a job that <unk> well now do we ever find that job yeah that's that's basically what i mean i haven't gone i like the job and i would love to do this part time and you know goof around and stuff but actually paid hourly basis yeah i i'm getting paid ten dollars an hour which is okay well yeah when are you going to see what i'm being pay really an everyday it's less what the face and like this week you know i might i'm probably work like around <unk> probably over twenty hours this week but then at first i guess she had already hired another lady or talk to someone else to start teaching this guy mhm and he wants five hours a day so what she did what she said well i'll give you know each of you half so i'm only teaching him <unk> monday <unk> saturday but i'm only teaching him like fourteen and a half hours a week and then but like she she asked me today can you think that's a lot of english for this this one guy who yeah but it goes by really quickly i'm amazed but they're they're real real loose real real nice real nice people she's ameri what does he like like uh what's his level uh well he he's beginning but but he's kinda one of those false beginners i mean he he understands quite a bit or can have you know that sort of simple conversation and stuff like <unk> <unk> actually can talk about a lot of things you know <unk> at a very simple level but i mean that gets all his verb chances mixed up and <unk> so you know it's all right i mean okay when shuki i'm kind of enjoying it so so i mean like you know it's it's all right now but like today she said can you feeling for me for a class tomorrow for an hour and a half and so i i think she's probably going to be like that because she's she's trying to get her masters because she's not sure they're going to be able to hang onto this language school because with the the evaluation of the past so they lost a lot of their clients uh okay and um so yeah we just had another one yeah <unk> <unk> and and december gas is going up well <unk> yeah somebody here so there's like <unk> it's it's really <unk> i was i almost had a fit the secretary systems changing the subject at school you don't have <unk> i made my test forever condemning stouffer first and second grade uh-huh i was saying you know when you make these <unk> can you redo some for me and she says well has sophie told you that um i don't know if i want this going on over there and

pay for my copies oh nice hadn't 'cuse me i mean i just you know <unk> any more i've just been so testy and uh and so i said uh you know if if that happens um i won't be here tomorrow was perfectly serious but the secretary thought it was funny so i don't know she passed the message <unk> <unk> i haven't heard it from sophie's mouth and i need to pay for my coffee my coffee my coffee and and some but anyway i'm not really all that happy there but but i liked the kids really well the kids are really cute and i'm i even have quarter they did <unk> tell <unk> that was screaming at halloween i got dressed up you know my which cost him i had to had from last year and everything's really really easy to get into the real they were just crazy they just loved it and they were so cute so uh in any way so but i'm i'm not happy with the pay and there's no there's no <unk> i should've you know <unk> stupid relatively right <unk> <unk> from the the pan and the fire or something yeah but i don't know if it's going <unk> i haven't even talked it down i sort of lost track happening over there so he's still there anyway yeah he's still there and there's a guy that kevin came as is a a a a kevin costner look alike oh really oh i maybe we should stay up early [laughter] and we could argue that this could have had a much better <unk> [laughter] so anyway and then i have private classes with um with with about seven <unk> the kids from from my group mhm so oh well that's good that's a little extra <unk> little bit extra coming in so he's so i'm sorry i interrupted go ahead i just the copies nothing i can when she told me about that <unk> i may not have a job here so just because i if she she says to me you're going to pay for your <unk> i'm not going to do it and i'll just sit <unk> and she won't fire me of course 'cause when she going to get another <unk> native speaker yeah off the bat or another english teacher period or not yeah i've been <unk> but maybe she'll give you the feel about <unk> <unk> and tell me about it if you don't have i took my little my my big cattle and i got one little tiny donut and <unk> we chicken treated at school [laughter] you can <unk> all the way

<unk> necklace after that was also spelled within a and so i just i pointed out necklace and then i said ooh wait there's more i said well i better <unk> come <unk> better stop here but then she's for not first grade teacher no yeah but she's but she's really a wonderful peppy lively you know <unk> fun <unk> fun person and you know step he's really happy and and elise's teacher is wonderful really really nice just just adorable lady that you know just oh i i at least is so sweet that i just love her and she's such a good student and uh she's just you know and she's really good i mean at least at least it's like reading books like crazy she was like mom i don't know i just love reading now and i just you know she's very wonderful really excited about school so then and she's you know she's made some friends here both of them but i'm in the neighborhood there's there are two kids that live across the street <unk> they go to a private catholic school close to here so they don't go to the same school but ah like the boys in second grade and the girls in sixth grade and that and they play really well with elise and steffi and then there's another little girl who's stays with her grandma until their mom picks rep after work who's in i think she's in first grade and she's comes over here almost every day to to play with him and stuff so [noise] you know they're they're basically pretty happy to um you know they like their school and that's that's that's the until like the only monkey or the yeah yeah you know <unk> <unk> <unk> well yeah yeah i envy you know <unk> did you hear the horror story well he was there for like <unk> like the forty days oh well this is he was supposed to be there for five days right but of course the show that he had pyro plasmosis which isn't what does that <unk> blood disease <unk> <unk> [noise] of course this had happened and <unk> but that was like major trauma and we were having major problems because of this major trauma [laughter] which i like to you and so i'm finally then you know calls all over mexico and all over texas blah blah blah to find out you know whether you can treat different i finally finds out from his better that into said that oh sure you can treat that don't worry blah blah blah but goes down but to make sure he actually you know treats it and gets rid of it he he goes down twice <unk> stays overnight for a night or two each time <unk> two or three nights each time at hotels and stuff and and and is giving this treatment to this <unk> comes back then goes back down <unk> another treatment and comes back then he has to go back down for when they take the blood out again after nightmare so and yeah and <unk> told me that's going <unk> you know horse was there for like six weeks or you know costing us you know <unk> more than much more than <unk> and the horses worth that we had <unk> wanted <unk> much <unk> definitely much more than it's worth to me [laughter] and but finally did get cured and so the second time they they approved it to come across the border blah blah and the only sort of good things that's happened in relation to wear so far is that in looking at stable can stuff around here it turned out somebody said there's a stable real close to your house but they're very expensive so we'd go there i said well let's just go look at it and see if maybe we can strike some kind of deal with them or whatever [noise] turns out that these people are uh their daughter was kicked in the head last last year <unk> horse and was in a coma and so they're like had major bills and stuff too but they <unk> they're building a new stable and want to build a new house and stuff so they we made a deal with them that that that would drop their plans for this <unk> this place in exchange for the first month uh rent and board <unk> right down the street from my house it's really really incredibly convenient for bet though but now they're they're leasing this property down and <unk> says they're moving by the middle of november so now we have this other you know dilemma now we're gonna now and he's tonight he's off <unk> meeting with some travel there that and it's going to see if he's maybe hook up with some people have met before ah no no <unk> well actually he actually some of these people that <unk> one of these guys who's going to a meeting with tonight actually said that he knew <unk> a child that beto knows in tuzla uh-huh not one of his friends but someone someone that that the nose into <unk> so it's kinda funny he's been what a small world you know um because this guy apparently used to live in guadalajara knew this guy too but <unk> so so he's still but i keep my cany find a job that you know jobs <unk> well first of all because he's got blue blood you know so <unk> unless unless you know something is big no you know <unk> you know they're they're he will probably be working because he wants the perfect nine to five job and you know you can't do that at first and good pay with you know even though even though he can't speak the language well [laughter] you know he doesn't he doesn't think that should be a problem right using and the the <unk> yeah in the real problem is that uh one of the other real problems is that all architects here almost i mean he's been to like two places so far that don't use computers for drafting now mhm and what do they use what what do they use they use i mean they use computers he had to use computers everybody i mean he's been to like two places that didn't require that you know computer drafting but oh what does that mean that means he has to take a course that <unk> take a course so he's currently <unk> if he's still here next week he signed up to take this computer computer <unk> computer assisted drafting course next <unk> next week which starts next week mhm which is it's just two nights a week so i mean he can still work and you know it's not like a fulltime commitment or anything but nobody should do that because then you know then he can get like referrals through these people and stuff yeah well that's what he's going to do but uh of course he's already planning that he's doing this so that then when he goes back to to slap he'll make a fortune see that's his plan oh yes he's already planning you know that oh well maybe we have to stay here this year because the girls are in school blah blah blah yeah yeah so he's and what are your thoughts on this uh well i thought i mean we we don't want it on the air [laughter] that's right [laughter] something we don't want <unk> you're right <unk> letter [laughter] have you know they i think if you made them moving stuff give it a chance that that's what i told him too i mean you know and and there are free english classes here and there are english that's what like when when <unk> when golf tee <unk> you know we were there are many many years ago and then they stopped it so that mean that's something they should take advantage <unk>

their house no you'll love this <unk> i work two days ago i'm watching <unk> what's called a and e. arts <unk> never cable station what station arts and entertainment is a cable station <unk> <unk>

and everything else <unk> said in a suburb of detroit and they started talking entering the lady that house <unk> nursing her baby sitting in a house you'll love us okay <unk> and the camera pans out for that they can <unk> extra milly how much about it and <unk> talking about you know all the the words and the j. words are going to take away the white people's rights on and on their hands to the outside of the house and i'm looking at the address and going oh my god it's their house oh wipe it almost ten minutes at their house filming insight into violent demonstration outside talking about residents who said drove the people away and stuff was sort of the things off the air i called the station from home and they were there <unk> copy the tape fourteen dollars somebody told <unk> she's excited to get the tape fishing show people her house [laughter] but it was basically it was a white area nation you know like you know pretty good <unk> type thing there which is real obvious from inside we see the house 'cause you can see exactly where the shelves were because they just found lifestyle the shelves in the kitchen yeah that's what you were there yeah yeah right yeah but it's a picture of the lady breast feeding her baby sitting right all kind of in a little chair and the kitchen right by the shelf aerial amazing yeah but it was amazing singing on on national television mhm they don't show the street name but they do show the address which is you know there's <unk> you can identify with unless you know you know that they're going to clear as day or whatever one for for whatever it is you know <unk> <unk> so that should probably coming a week or so yeah that'll <unk> mommy said that she'd postponed visit you <unk> couple of times just serve assorted reasons i'm in their health their parents yeah well no they wanted to go first to a a thing in toronto than henry spent the night in the hospital last week or two weeks ago <unk> what was that apparently nothing they released on he woke up with the attorneys language they you know from what mom's side of the financially nothing send them home <unk> which <unk> says that she doesn't know you but to say hi who lee he my adopted ukrainian daughter color i spend every day and night for <unk> yeah she was out the door <unk> okay so he says again what i'm a henry woke up with you know i guess feeling that have some kind of hanging in his arm mhm <unk> going to call the doctor homeless the know don't you don't like going <unk> i'm the hospitals they went to the e._r. mhm and i guess they kept them for <unk> twenty four hours <unk> upon absolutely nothing i mean not a thing <unk> which could be you know something very insignificant like a a mini my guess there was something medical this called the c._i._a. utterance transients scheme of attack <unk> like a mini mini mini stroke which is actually fairly common people don't even know if they have one often either that or for his nothing <unk> <unk> if you're on this subject already um i told you i mean i think i told them when i was a state that i had all those all these headaches and stuff yeah had this and they said they found like a a sister or something they'll sit there was nothing <unk> about a couple of weeks ago i had a plane with the uh assistant uh she for the department the news surgery department balance in hospitals when the big <unk> hospitals mhm and i took all my c._d.'s and the letter also he looked at it and he says he says he thinks i had a very mild very very mild job and <unk> and it is not a <unk> now he's orange me an m._r._i. to be done i haven't that's what they call <unk> stay <unk> also <unk> yeah yeah which apparently is i think the one that <unk> pretty much the top of the top of the tests that can be done i think the nice thing is when you're like five thousand dollars or something like that but you know i don't beyond paid for by the and the health insurance you know he's not positive but that's what <unk> looks as if it's like swelling around a hum blood vessels something they're not <unk> <unk> no i haven't seen anything to mommy's that don't want <unk> know she'd be all concerned joe and i'm waiting for that and i'm not you know he didn't seem horribly worried because <unk> like he didn't tell me to do anything different in the way of doing anything until you know you know he's already <unk> we'll see we'll throw the term don't t._i. eighty them he'll know what <unk> three well pardon i'm sure i mean maybe that's the <unk> the it's possible that might be the term using just didn't use the term 'cause he might consider too technical terms use and i didn't know what i said what's that you know i didn't know <unk> i had no idea what he was using that maybe was even one of them 'cause they're also saying now sometimes with their thinking is cause like mysterious plane crashes and stuff on people under pressure is having a pilot having a school it's the c._i._a. has a momentary many stroke brooklyn three seconds he's kind of out of it whether you have <unk> a fighter <unk> six hundred miles an hour that's a major problem yeah for a three second loss of you know <unk> was not <unk> you know <unk> a few months of you know very bad headaches and dizziness and occasionally i lose my balance bitten and sort of slowly but surely it hasn't been a hundred percent i built the headaches <unk> except you know here and there no headaches <unk> but i still occasionally have a bit of did they did <unk> i don't know we'll see and i just you know even with <unk> i'm a little bit nervous about this the new job but i said i'm not even going to mention it i would have mentioned that all the way you know <unk> <unk> it'll happen happen something and not you know i i can't put my life on standby the maybe i'm <unk> i'm thinking maybe it will cause a problem you know because he didn't seem you know basically he said well look at you know you were younger let's take care of you and they just doesn't want to do more tests and make sure i think he said if i had to see he's done they can be done those winston was out i think i'd ninety something injected in if they both have been done he said you can do better comparisons been looking at them but they only did one by me mhm so he said he couldn't really you know be sure and i guess thing has been order undo test any way you figure you might as well or the m._r._i. which is even better a better <unk> some way out i maybe i'll give them a call next week and they're supposed to call me when my appointment is maybe we'll call <unk> know <unk> when <unk> but i you know when he's he said the word and he'd <unk> <unk> and <unk> was literally isn't it an event you know he said you had to you know and i think you maybe had a you know a very small events mhm and and <unk> said you know and i said you know event you mean like stroke you know use the english word he goes yeah what [laughter] you know totally shocked but again it just sort of thing i suppose you know we know very possible never would knows you didn't you know checking those happen to see you know <unk> and you could say it was interesting with the c._d. you could see there was <unk> one layer we did see a rather large black area and the second <unk> another layer the next <unk> we've been the just a little bit of us are getting smaller and have you lived in c._d.s oh yeah they're pretty neat <unk> <unk> you know it's like detailed the i'll usually yeah yeah <unk> i don't know what the m._r._i. looks like it looks the same are different or whatever and i'm not quite sure what the differences between the two of them but <unk> mean <unk> those little miriam mentioned a bit of something this is just there and you haven't gotten any details okay i won't much write your mom but i figured there no plane getting mommy or does she mentioned that you <unk> <unk> what headaches or something you know well yeah that was <unk> and i'm and i didn't i think it was before i went to the states i seen the neurologist and carriage monday she pretty much just said it's you know it's it's in my head and you know i was you know just bad mood tension whatever and you know it'll go away and now <unk> and i was extremely <unk> you know bad sort of mood and the spring and it's possible something that that also leaving bring little joke on it on the street <unk> extremely tense and upset all the time and i think that that that some of them does when people you know sort of over we're <unk> you know so i don't know <unk> you know what what will be in the end <unk> listening to the blood thinner called <unk> <unk> or something my prescribe are there are concerned and they're like what it's called yes we will see him he didn't seem to see any <unk> any reason to to describe anything until we have the rest of testing so we'll see what <unk> what did you think they actually i know i have this i didn't even mentioned this to him i only saw the leader i've got this problem where i rules you know i get black and blue very very easily and i remember i was one <unk> tested at the hospital on them and they said that i have sort of a borderline problem with <unk> with <unk> sites or something like that and <unk> i'm not sure what i know what you mean but i can do about the blood sliding i guess where it said you know it's it's borderline that's why bruised so easily but you know <unk> it's not dangerous but that's just why it happens that from just the slightest little not <unk> i get very big black and blue <unk> and i'm trying to think how this would relate if this'll be the same direction as a stroke or the other direction if i'm not sure if they even related you know i'd be guess it'll be guessing they're how many people <unk> <unk> yeah also but actually when i go back next time i think i will actually mentioned that to them even though i didn't even think of it before the blood samples when you're there you know he had the time we just talk to me okay <unk> probably will next time i had well actually they did a lot of blood tests before and i think they were written down the letter <unk> did they sent <unk> ordered pretty <unk> you know they were obviously looking also the possibility of cancer or whatever you know them and they did pretty thorough i'm <unk> i'm thinking <unk> blood work i had my eyes tested let's see i had the c. g. done had anything <unk> <unk> no not e._k._g. e._e._g. is anything you know <unk> <unk> yeah well they hook all these like does your head yeah yeah i had that done and what else was there i think that's about <unk> and <unk> pretty thorough test <unk> suppose <unk> i'm <unk> i thought this has now is the guy already well according to a few minutes close <unk> close to warn you yeah well they do i number <unk> they warn you and you've got about one minute left to go yeah when they warn you didn't eat deal <unk> <unk> would marry him also range <unk> yeah you mean she can't do underground with him any more she's got probably not <unk> he's a different name for example <unk> windows how <unk> how <unk> outside yeah no here it's pretty nice weather not not real hot or any you know <unk> started with the rain i'm curious to see how <unk> your nice a nice winter non mhm mm mhm mhm <unk> when <unk> we will <unk> will probably be seeing a david in vietnam about a month from now <unk> got an invitation to thirty year reunion to his um army unit from when he he was in his basic training <unk> and it's being held her the keyboards that

see and then we'll have all day saturday that sort of came out nicely 'cause otherwise they're probably would've wouldn't bother to go even though <unk> last earning the had he was the only one that didn't show up [laughter] isn't that nice <unk> have you ever go to these things you get the reunion every year for the group <unk> no not at all there was some sort of reunion about a year to go i

you know i might not find out about a school until he's already got a job [noise] oh yeah [laughter] so you know i'm trying to think about where would i really don't want to live like we were thinking

be neat to go sightseeing well would you you said you would feel comfortable joan that's fine i don't get <unk> you back saying that i think she's kind of like insecure yeah and well i guess she's the one on one of the problem there yeah um well i i thought of that when i'm you know when my father came up to kind of work and he visited laurel it's definitely not well i'll tell you i'd be pissed myself [laughter] too [laughter] yeah [laughter] so well i was talking to him about <unk> having the wedding in june and he said well i could come <unk> joan couldn't come <unk> thought that was weird

feeling here people are sort of more conservative i uh i gathered that they're not that crazy the can fish <unk> you're not that crazy about english speaking people [noise] is that true or there's a lot of discrimination if you don't speak french and are you not french canadian or what's the other way around you know for for years <unk> that mean english have more power here they're a minority but they have more money and stuff there for years it was against the law to speak french at work even though there was <unk> majority oh really and all the signs in english in the fifties sixties and early seventies oh some of the gun on an an french which <unk> the french canadian <unk> called the white niggers are never treated like shit really yeah and that's that's where all the history of all the stealing or go oh is this is this kind of like northern ireland then like yeah like that oh wow you know eve grew up in that and and he refused to speak english because of that and <unk> moved to los angeles [noise] oh i'm sure there's been a referendum in the past and then um the french canadian see that they were too scared they voted now and they thought there would be always constitutional changes but then they got screwed by the government they they totally back down and all the changes they were going to make and made things even harder for <unk> french canadian so that's why they're the continuing with these referendum you know but still people are too scared but like overall like english infringe they get along i mean they're white <unk> each other <unk> the canadians are but there's <unk> like on the talk shows there's all this anger on both sides all kind of like the blacks and whites there well nothing on that but yeah <unk> and you know in face to face it's uh you know for white as a rule but but you know it's not as much violence years and us yeah so yeah there's all this stuff [laughter] behind it and um yeah i mean people are nice to me if i speak english <unk> i've never i've never gotten one bad thing happened to me oh well good yeah so anyway we gotta get back yeah like whenever i go to the u._s. could really [laughter] like i want to hear us news and i

honey and i'm going on when i hit her you know i think maybe i've got a problem here [laughter] so [noise] uh i've been trying to um act a little better and i thought i had been acting a little better [laughter] it's amazing how resentful <unk> my her when she wants to do something i was like wow you know and i usually do it but [noise] but uh she doesn't really ask for much she really doesn't and i could certainly be a lot nicer and still not break my back over anything so [noise] um that's been improving my my attitudes than improving there and then the thing <unk> you know with jerry he's um [noise] it's just it's it's it's it's over i mean it's it's really over we we can still go out i'm not looking for anybody else and i'm not looking to get out of my life and i'd still like to see 'em but i don't ever want to live within again and i i don't ever want to be involved in his miss finance just insanity this you know you just well i want to have a house like that and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that and i want to have this and i wouldn't buy new dodge pickup next year and <unk> it almost seems he wants to do the big plans and he and he he refuses to go to work [laughter] we're just it's just nuts and i'm one of my friends is and i was reading the thing i think it was newman are robert johnson they talk about the <unk> <unk> you are <unk> <unk> where yeah sounds like you said peter pan and your letter yeah well um and one of my friends <unk> she says that that comes from having a a consuming mother and i guess she was i don't know she looks doesn't look she looks alright but but the this is just you know he's fifty six years old and that's jerry [noise] so [noise] once and the last day or two i've just i've just started <unk> i'm ready for some stability and i thought oh what a concept <unk> i haven't really been in a market for it up till now um i i wouldn't know how to go about getting it either it's just that hey i think i'm ready for it just oh [laughter] interesting [laughter] and that sort of hit me too when i i told you about realizing that tutor tutoring is not very stable and i don't enjoy it that much anymore it's okay but that's why i think i i'm going to go back to school you're ready for stability too yeah i mean i want to have a profession that i can use and get a job and have a practice and that i would enjoy more and ah you know i think about marrying eve and if i wanted to i could just be a housewife and he's gonna make a lot of money and everything but that doesn't make me feel too comfortable [laughter] so um you know i want to go back to school and know that it's <unk> it's nice though to have a man who would allow you that option there are men out there who will not be happy until you're learning you know you're it's as if they don't if you know <unk> you know i'm trying to say yeah um yeah so i think that's neat but yeah i understand what you're saying it's yeah you need something for yourself right and it's not just a matter of money but having my own life too yeah but um one thing i was gonna ask you about was like you were getting all excited about doing financial planning and lieutenant have you thought about going to school right now well i haven't gotten too far on that i um [noise] took a little three session course at the local you know <unk> adult school on financial planning and <unk> a a financial planner did the class and i says how did you get to be that and he says well it took a class his basically says you there's a little outfit in denver where you can take a correspondence course and be one but he got a an undergraduate degree in finance i thought well that sounds interesting i don't know if i wanted to go that far but i'm just pointing and the direction of learning more about money and i've got a net worth statement now and it's i'm <unk> i just is i'm just surprised to learn my net worth his increasing every month you know because <unk> when i count the stuff up that like there's <unk> eight hundred and ten dollars every month increased equity in the the building wow yeah and a few years ago it was only two hundred a month and and there's that and then i'm you know saving money through my retirement see i don't have any income at the disposable income much now but there's future stuff this thing you know if i can manage to get the equity out of the building without giving at all to taxes yeah so that's going to be a big problem so um [noise] i'm just trying to learn about money and and it's it's not that hard i still don't know about price expense ratios with some of the stuff just doesn't compute like you should buy bonds when interest rates are coming down but not always and you know [laughter] why is that and <unk> and i've had <unk> numerous times that i still don't quite get it but i will <unk> you know it's just this life seems to be all about mastery right now just a learning computers and riding a bicycle and ring about money and stuff mhm [noise] so um i i feel pretty good this thing with jerry <unk> it's made me upset us i guess mostly are just beating myself <unk> here's another relationship but you know i never did taken seriously as a marriage partner after the first month or two and but i was comfortable and i enjoyed being with him for the most part although the circumstances have changed now he's just he's standing on a shrinking iceberg talking about his big plans you know he's probably going to end up living with his mother like me but [noise] you know <unk> raggedy asked and i'm <unk> <unk> does he like you say it's over but does he know that [noise] oh have you talked about it or is he like sort of assuming that you're just gonna always be there we can go out you know was indefinitely as far as i'm concerned but i have no plans to be with them for the future i don't have any plans not to be with him either but i don't know if he's gonna get bummed out by this for a he's said the other day and when <unk> and and kind of a crappy moody says he wants all or nothing in a relationship [noise] oh and the strong statement iffy presses it then i guess i'll have to say it'll be nothing uh-huh and i've never been <unk> terribly involved in his financial problems but i find i do things that i'm gonna try stopping white guy i'm afraid of being alone and so i asked him if he wanted to go to this aid banquet and i i don't my biased ticket you know not really <unk> buy his own damn tickets and there's no reason why i should buy it but i just want to make sure he'd go mhm so i'm going to stop doing stuff like that and he doesn't want to go and i'll go with somebody else well that's the thing the thing about being alone i mean it is hard it is hard i've been alone a lot yeah and i i kept meeting these men that i mean i was really wanting to meet somebody and i kept meeting these men and then trying them out and then it's more <unk> you know i'd like hope i keep hoping and i got pretty good at ending <unk> these things after about three months [laughter] you know they just kept meeting people will just ending them [noise] and ah yes it is hard to like i enjoy being alone too though yeah go less scary after a while yeah well i'm gonna have to come to terms with that 'cause i basically had men in my life <unk> pass thirty five years i figure the then july nineteen ninety one i was alone for three weeks [laughter] up till i've only had some man around mhm and maybe it's time to give that a look yeah because i don't know i i i really <unk> enjoy not meeting somebody mhm and uh i felt really good not meeting somebody not needing somebody <unk> somebody yeah and like i could just turn my attention to other things well some of my friends that <unk> don't need a man and i i know that but on some level i don't yeah yeah it's a real internal thing yeah [noise] so anyway i'm jerry's around and you know like when i was using my mother's recliner here i'm sitting in right now i can't get the damn foot rest down so i'm probably gonna have to call them up to get 'em to come and get it down for me if i don't want to break the damn thing you know stuff like that it's nice <unk> nice to have a man around well maybe you could look underneath it and see if you could yeah i don't know how the hell <unk> did you look <unk> yeah i'm kind of looking at a cheap plastic thing and <unk> yeah just turn it over that um [noise] <unk> sounds like one of the joints is not working well i don't know i just moved it out for <unk> uh-huh and uh oh there's a thing on the side oh hey i just [laughter] [laughter] is that handle i forgot about it no you don't have to call them just sucks [laughter] yeah and i don't have <unk> call him [laughter] that's nice <unk> too <unk> too low well grandma can fix that <unk> yeah oh they're back and oh i don't know how to fix that but she knows how to do that [noise] so <unk> oh there goes oh all right [laughter] now back in business [laughter] that's always exhilarating when you can do something yourself yeah yeah well even i got this big thing because [noise] the house has been a mess and then <unk> then the house has been really mess and then then he spent like hours putting up these shelves and i i was getting really pissed off because i was doing listed cleaning [noise] so i i started getting an argument with him and he got mad because he's been working on the show <unk> and i can't do show so i don't know how to do shows and so we finally agreed that he would teach me how to do these things so that i don't have to just clean [laughter] because that's all i know how to do [noise] you know do the shelves put the shelves up oh drill holes in the wall put these little things <unk> yeah well it's good to know that stuff you know not to really be dependent yeah i mean i'm so dumb about stuff and there's no reason i'm very bright you know but yeah i feel the remember that there was a handle on the right side of you know this <unk> thing and um so i was pushing down on the on the foot part and it looks cheap plastic and i could have broken without much trouble and jerry would've come over and <unk> and said something he's pretty good <unk> he's not <unk> not that condescending but jeeze you know like [laughter] as well i do have a masters degree well you know there's different types of intelligence or or ability it's like there's the sensation typing a photographer knows how to fix things there's uh intuitive try <unk> the ah these other different types of you know people um intuition since

dimensions but <unk> really smart that way he's the sensation type yeah yeah [noise] that's about my line of intelligence i tell you what we do is we start we we discount they're kind of intelligent

i've been looking for a new apartment but that's interesting business in japan yeah and so i really need a new place but it everyone like taking forever to make up their minds of those things and i can't explain it i mean i can but [laughter] i just woke up from like well how do i [laughter] but basically i'm still in my apartment with a dripping feelings and it's kind of interesting situation but um yeah things are going well yeah i heard he got hit by carmel and oh it's no big deal <unk> <unk> i mean i buy a car when i was totally fine really serious you know what <unk> i'm sure i heard that i got hit by a car [laughter] you didn't know how to sew bike yeah and i had a hell of it on that you know but it wasn't bad at all i can hit the back in the bike okay and so i just like <unk> over in the bike didn't work anymore but i was fine i was really fun too i thank god that was really scratched up and i looked like a mutant but <unk> it hailed so okay but more important things with what's his face <unk> david <unk> oh gosh yeah well he like called me this first or second they would hear something he's such a jerk on the phone i didn't understand why you sound like that for a while you know and so it was really really upset 'cause when i first got here originally said about him coming and about people coming and seeing me and blah blah blah and i just like her i finally like david what's going on why decently so says it's such a stranger on the phone you know i'm like you know if you're not happy with our relationship and we had to talk about it and like decide something 'cause i feel like horrible so he uh [laughter] so he like he's like well i didn't want to tell you this is having a little while ago whatever and he's like i cheated on you know and of course like i just couldn't believe it [laughter] it's like what <unk> there was like totally out of the blue it'd happened like a month ago [noise] and uh we're still in in new jersey over the summer them yes it was in um [noise] it was when um i got home from shelter island and he called like at a total desperation saying like he had to move he's living uh some psycho right there i remember that yeah and then i didn't hear from for like a whole week for his completely unlike him yeah so he chews neil cheated on me right after you off from me around that time with the psycho woman or who knows the psycho woman with this um woman like he'd been living with a three two guys and ugh woman yeah and his old apartment and um the woman was one of the guys boyfriend girlfriend right i remember that yeah and so he cheated with her oh yeah so he told me how like at that time um when he left the house he had health her move into her new place and she helped him move out of the house yeah and he said he was feeling really crappy and like i know i had written him a letter saying that like you know i should see other people and blah blah and so he was really upset about everything at that point and then she like told him that um she really really liked him alive and she's really you know had feelings for him and and then they had sex and i'm like well how he's like pretty upset [laughter] i'm sure yeah like i just really devastated me for like just so unexpected it totally devastated me i couldn't believe it i mean i can't and like especially to tell you this when you're you know fairly new and such a strange place and so probably going through a lot of shit anyways [noise] oh yeah oh and i first got here is a big party like happened because <unk> you know to be a real real jerk being paid right [laughter] there's nothing there <unk> when i got here and yeah everything you're already and i just went through major right so i don't know lots of things have happened and i'm just trying to look on the bright side when i was reading the letter <unk> because i mean i am happy here like i'm really happy with stuff i've been dating a lot since then and i got my life together and and my job is really easy you know <unk> you know [noise] hey ah have so much to learn here so that's exciting <unk> bored and i just like don't sleep enough gives you will because i'm <unk> excited about everything there is to do this new apartment problem if i could just move into a new apartment then i'd be all that [laughter] so what else mentally happened with that thing did i mean oh yeah i'm like you stay together for a while or some yeah we did like okay well i was completely and totally just horrified and like like crying for a while on the phone <unk> just couldn't believe i couldn't it was so bad because most is like i completely uh trusted him trusted him link and not feel like it's so bad because like his like that when he broke that trust straight he broke it in all people like not just in the guys yeah you know what i mean like for for a week i just hated everybody yeah and it was so bad 'cause there's right when he got here so it was like i didn't want to meet anybody new i couldn't like i'm so damn stands crying like constantly you know and it was just like i couldn't trust anybody because you know you if you decide to trust somebody so much and you just come <unk> completely never think that they could do that to you right right and then they do you mean it's just like [noise] i totally know how that feels <unk> yeah so i guess i drove trust anyone yeah and i guess they <unk> from too though and they don't mean that is cynical way because like i totally believe that you have to keep trusting people knew like for a while i was really angry but now i'm like you know you just have to keep trusting people and they screw up their human and things like that might keep happening and whatever i don't know if i could ever trust anyone and i don't know if he's not like that though like that i don't think i ever will dress anybody like that again the number of times i've heard a woman's day i know he would never do that i know him you would never do that i swear you said i swear i said i've always said to him and said oh i didn't want <unk> from now on it's just like well you know i trust him i i mean i would i i hope you could like that but it happened i i i could never see myself being that naive again mhm and that's probably healthier and good but it is that it's like you lost your innocence or something and you have to do that to you i mean if you could just live your whole life in this happy love trust faithful kind of thing imagine the kind of person who would beat this young romantic fool passionate and like just crazy and not bittered by the kids <unk> for me though like yeah i mean i don't want to see that we trusted the wrong people because i mean i really believe that david the good person right and like at first like when he first told me i'm just like david you know always love you whatever but i i'm going to go now and you made your decision and there's nothing else to talk about something in a way he was trying to tell you something by doing that you know he's totally like unhappy by what was going on because he basically he wanted to be the other right he wanted like he needed a sexual relationship yeah and he needed me to be there and you needed to like someone nurturing and all that crap and i just wasn't doing it and i know that that was really hard on them i was always telling him that we weren't like working out i was always saying i didn't want to be with him i mean [noise] and so like he did me the biggest favor though and that's why like i got over really quickly it's kind of funny because yeah because like at first it was really devastating right like it's so weird because the difference between josh and him like josh was devastating for a long time <unk> even though he wasn't as nearly as like i never had as many because deep feelings for him and it never like with the series many ways but with david it was like i think 'cause i'd been in pain for so long with like the problem with my parents and problems with him and all this pressure that by the time he finally cheated on me i just realized <unk> first they didn't say i had to and <unk> interesting so i told him goodbye and then he called me again day later to we talked things over and then he called me and we talked things over and they decided that i could forgive him right and we could still be going out 'cause they still loved him and i could understand how it happened because of the situation but i i told him i still thought it was shitty and horrible and whatever mhm that i could forgive him but it would take <unk> little rational view i can't believe you know but it was though and i really did like forgive him it was like you know i thought about the whole thing and and and besides many times i thought about cheating too 'cause i like i just couldn't understand that part of it really well you know and at the time when he called me i wasn't there for him and he really needed to talk to me and i was really cool i was like listen to my parents are here i can't talk to you by you know so then i had forgiven him but it's still like just heard it wasn't the same any more you know <unk> and he's so far away and there are other people here that were interesting to me and i didn't want him to come live with me it didn't want it and he wanted that yeah and they had a lot of pressure and they didn't want to promise you might come live with him when <unk> after a year and so finally we had another conversation awhile ago and [noise] and um [noise] it was actually a while ago i was in september or something there early september and i was just like you know we really need to talk and i think it's really over and blah blah blah and he's just like he was less like i was more like it's over and he's less like it's okay you know but he's like okay and then so that was it we're over and then i hadn't talked to him for weeks and weeks and i had a really bad cold <unk> sick and he called me up again it's just the worst that he had been drinking little bit yeah it's been so he's just like i really miss you really want to get back together and blah blah blah and i'm just like no i like you know he made me start crying though she started like reminiscing i hate when they do that or whatever they yeah so i started crying <unk> and i had been sick and like on medicine all week so i you know it's just like you're depressed anyway and so and so he's just like let's get back together and i wanna see you and all this stuff and i'm just like and then i like at the end the conversation i got myself together like no you know i'd like we're going he's like well where are you going i'm like i don't know but i like that [laughter] and i'm just like you know and i can't promise to see you again or whatever <unk> and it just like <unk> you <unk> <unk> <unk> it's all been <unk> explain it but you know it's just it's not right because all the pressure feelings started coming back and everything so and he's just and i'm like listen you know you never know we may get back together way the future but i just can't think about that now i want to be free and all this stuff so then he just got <unk> letter from him <unk> great and he's like you know i really miss you <unk> and he's like this big phone bill can you hardly pay no way and i'm right forget that we're not the thing is though is like i would help them <unk> because he paid for everything like more seriously this guy spent like twelve thousand dollars <unk> relationship or someplace thousands like to do to see me three times <unk> that's true you paid for all the phone bills you paid for <unk> <unk> last summer you pay for <unk> for the thing yeah and like do you ever come to japan no no okay and like the thing is is that i wanted to help him pay for <unk> the phone bill right i saw that pissed because i felt like listen if you hadn't screwed around we won't have talked too much and the phone but i know we would have talked to a lot and plus he <unk> he just i just feel so grateful that were like broken up i can't tell you how great flight away maids things simpler for you it's such a complicated situation it really right right so complicated and then you weren't <unk> i think sara lee ready for it i mean not <unk> i wasn't ready for it was just too young you just like he's a good person but like also after bring you might not be honest about certain things about how like he just wasn't responsible enough for me in many ways and yeah and i could depend on him away like i need to depend on somebody right like i really don't like as far as the phone bill like he just shouldn't have called so much i don't have that problem i didn't i hadn't phone bill but mine was like a hundred dollars that was like talks all the times that i call them right he says over a thousand oh my god yeah and like i just wouldn't do that 'cause i knew i couldn't handle that kind of phone bill you know what i mean so i mean that just makes me kinda mad because it's part of him and how easy responsible with money and whatever so i was going to help them pay for it but i can't yet because i'm going to move and it costs over three thousand dollars to move in japan yeah so i don't have that kinda money right now and <unk> what you're doing with dating and stuff <unk> especially you just like seeing a bunch of people a bunch of people are the ones who are teaching there as well or they happening uh it's like it's like kind of a mature there's this one guy <unk> who loves to dance and he's

mean he holds it between his middle <unk> for <unk> for finger huh and she doesn't like that i see and so she says you know she says it's okay but you know she thinks that he would be a better ryder if he put it between the dominant for finger yeah so we're trying to teach him over but it's hard to teach someone that's already got their way that <unk> that's right just let him do what year was easier for him you know but i mean he is doing so good i mean he rides complete words now good and and you out at my love him i will he can't wait to come home he's already talking about it yeah i'm

6033-0000000-0000369 are you on i'm there yeah okay <unk> do you tell me you know like who's doing the research or what it is okay let me just read this it's coming out of the university of pennsylvania and his uh-huh collecting telephone conversations in american english someone who's across or someone who's in a foreign country but american born so huh you qualify for that [laughter] [laughter] [noise] and um as part of this research um it's any place in the world uh-huh i'm i'll get ten dollars i think ten but it's going to the milwaukee cheaper here that's like a g._e._d. one of our sisters works there so somebody huh that money will you know go there and um you can talk to anyone for thirty minutes uh let's see what else <unk> the identities of the participants will be kept confidential <unk> will be released with the recorded <unk> <unk> ah data you the <unk> yeah we'll be asked to obtain consent than the call party before we hoarding begins and that i did mhm so it's i guess this research is um you know i don't know if it's the see the <unk> it's you know the <unk> weeks and then <unk> sticks you know the the pattern of how we talk [laughter] uh-huh so it is and what we talk about or whatever so how have you been well i've been doing pretty good <unk> <unk> and you know [laughter] [noise] it's like you know you go well that's a big question to answer but really you know i can tell that i'll be here a year in january that's right and you know <unk> i always say it takes me a year to get adjusted almost to wherever you go yeah but i mean here it's like there's so much to get adjusted to uh-huh but i think i can say that you know i i think i'm feeling better about everything okay okay and not learning chinese is getting better but [laughter] but that's extremely difficult i find it very very hard i just um [noise] oh you know you learn every lesson you for the last thing you do fair and then you go on there and then the next when you keep learning so much you can't remember i can't remember what i learned yeah you get i'm like that too [laughter] i mean it it really does get harder the older you get <unk> well i think i think people say that you know that you don't remember his well fifty six <unk> as you did <unk> you know you were in your twenties yeah one of my fellow the <unk> the sister i'm living with there's five of us that live together and um one let's see she's got thirty five and she keeps the whole age doesn't make any difference i think yes it does because they just don't think you'd do remember as well yeah yeah well and i think too if a person has been well you know we keep ourselves learning okay but i think in that intensity you know like some people are working at like research or whatever i think their minds are more stimulated or or something i don't know you know when they're <unk> letting all the time <unk> see i mean we after schooling i mean we all four courses and you know things like that but i i don't know what it is mhm but then i i don't know if i could have learned that even at twenty five or thirty five you know oh i don't know if if i [laughter] like twenty minutes or how well you know i would have gone to be truthful i'm concentrate mainly on trying to learn to speak and to understand [noise] um i'm not trying to learn to write you know <unk> it's just 'cause i figured i'd just i don't think i'm gonna have to write that much in my day to day work at the hospital uh-huh because you can chart i'm in the healthcare field apparently in english and or chinese oh so um you know for that reason and i said you know you go to school for two years it'll take a year to get oriented and i don't know what i'm going to be doing [laughter] yeah so i i will i will not be literate i'm afraid by the time i leave you know as far as being able to write well i'll be able to write basic but uh you know [noise] i just hope i said i find it so hard to understand what people say 'cause it's like an english you know new people who are learning our language yes you know they say we talk so fast yeah mhm yeah of course i say the same thing about the people here they talked so fast yeah i'm that it's just it's very hard to not do to learn it do they have um like tone yeah <unk> where you if you started higher or lower medium or whatever you know what <unk> well there's yeah there's four different tone okay and um every word is you know one tone or another yeah and they have so many words that are the same thing yeah <unk> you know like i keep saying you can say ma ma yeah la la you know and everyone means something different yeah and then sometimes you have two that are the same <unk> said mom law but they're different characters when you speak it you know you only know supposedly from the contacts which one of those it is wow wow and there's some words like sure that oh they've so make characters i don't know how you get it altogether [laughter] yeah [laughter] well uh but you know <unk> they say that the first year is hard i guess the second year gets harder harder and harder yeah [laughter] and my teacher says you know you do you learn all this <unk> pain you learn patterns for two years then you sort of go to where you're going you know and then you spend a year sort of almost i'm really learning the words that you use frequently oh you know and you <unk> you start learning those and high you know how you say <unk> i'm sure like and healthcare um i'll you know get familiar with certainly saying you know how you feeling today where is your pain you know are you sick to your stomach or how long has it been you know how long have you had you know there's this routine things sure that in that environment you will you know concentrate on yeah so after i finish the book i 'cause i have you have two two major books that you learn basic vocabulary learned over a thousand characters own and i'm going i'm going to try and spend several months four months maybe at least be a little bit more learning healthcare terminology oh because then i hope you know that um that will be more practical uh-huh you know you could <unk> you could learn business terminology you could learn a lot of um take moral tails the different things like that but i keep thinking well you know i'm going to be working with people yeah so i need to learn how to talk to them right up my my that is some yeah i figured it was like that see when i was on guam the vietnamese uh came <unk> and i um we took in uh some sisters and so each day yeah each evening after supper i would go over and try to teach them english you know and uh so i could feel the frustration of train dinner and i asked them to teach me you know um you know just a word or or you know things like that and then i got a book you know but nothing on a regular basis for myself it was just you know like just to give back to me that frustration that they were feeling <unk> you know the language and it was so complicated and they had five <unk> nation i mean mhm and um and i cannot hear the difference you know because i remember one thing i remember like arm was <unk> and and string was <unk> he <unk> when the different different ways you know <unk> down over or whatever and it's like i could not i could not here and they would keep seen it and i would listen and i could not get that [noise] mhm so but look at isn't that amazing how we learn as we grow as a baby mhm mhm you know that really is a miracle when you think about <unk> it is because um you know when we look back and i have to be truthful i've <unk> i've become so much more cognizant about how we use grammer and you know how we express themselves because i help um i've i've done some volunteering with helping the local um chinese people to work with their english oh and you know you sort of laugh at the mistakes they make uh-huh and they said oh my god you know i'm making a mistake so much worse because here the kids start studying english in there a freshman year in high school some of 'em in junior high so by the time they get to college you know they have at least four to six years of learning about can be larry wow okay now what they don't get to do is to talk a lot um so i mean it's like me i i find it so hard to speak because i have to think oh let's see i wanna say like i was just thinking i could stay too you know i could say what we're doing is very interesting <unk> you know and i have to think now let's see what and then we and then doing you thinking about <unk> then it's the grammar order because what's the grammar is the opposite of what we have an english wow isn't that you know 'cause if i say you know i like you i can say <unk> i neat now that's the same order or they see me why you i like uh you know there's so many things i'm utopia say that children are i'm buying candy you didn't go heights and then my tongue wearing <unk> tang heights them in my or you know there's there's so many different ways of saying it and you go now which way do i use now [laughter] [laughter] oh oh oh yeah so and um now are you living with a chinese sisters or are they from all different cultures new you know when i first came here i live um [noise] really in a residence for girls and there was one part of florida they had six sisters on and there were two of us tour americans one was from the philippines one was to or from korea and one was from here and taiwan [noise] so there were six of us know each we did our own cooking and you know so you didn't have a lot in common oh yeah um but we just found that environment so hard because with no cooking facilities and know you <unk> you know no place wash dishes and the noise level was awful so we have moved in as of october first with the sisters are providence from terre haute indiana oh okay they <unk> they have a mission over here i call it and um they're three sisters from their order that we live with two of us another american myself into the three sisters one is another american and then the other two are native i'm taiwanese people oh all right so at this point um my other two companions speak much better chinese than i do one will be finishing next may the other is just a gifted person and you know just picks up real well it all along you know like she'd been here <unk> the one <unk> gets that means <unk> she's she started when i did and last march had studied for two months in the states <unk> <unk> oh she went back and studied again and the way they study um they concentrate i'm speaking and vocabulary so she's done extremely well wow mine but she's she's also about thirty five years old [laughter] but <unk> teacher <unk> there is something about um you know you have it or you don't you know i think that's true <unk> <unk> it's a gift because um my niece suzy you know she had learned german in a high school and then she got a scholarship to germany so her first year of college was in germany and then when she came back um she continued at um u. w. madison and while she was there she meets the guy from holland well they're married now you know but they went together for a couple of years you know while he was here and then his time was up and he he went back and then he came here and and within um i would say about a half a year or something like that maybe a year then she took dutch you know like gosh and speaks that very fluently and i thought well gee i didn't get that [laughter] sounds <unk> german and and <unk> i'm <unk> and it just flows she just flows you know i think there's some relationship between german and dutch you know i think if you learn german i i just have a feeling you can probably pick up a <unk> i had asked her about that but there are no <unk> to some extent but then you have to know which is which oh i see you know maybe maybe lamp the lamp and one and <unk> and the other uh-huh you know i think <unk> she said there were some words like that but it is it's going to say like a different language yeah <unk> yeah i'm you know tell me yeah how how leaving us how's your mother 'cause i just i just wrote you a
