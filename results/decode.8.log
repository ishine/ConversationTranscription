whatever increments well the the bad part about that is is that my last year's insurance would've covered it off unless it was never covered by insurance anyway um if it doesn't have to do was shots but <unk> can you tell 'em immune immunizations it's lori lori john john one says i. n. g. injection yeah that's it yeah that doesn't surprise me that doesn't surprise me i thought we were getting off a little bit easy on those injection one for <unk> an injection and one for john has an injection right on the other just says non allowable by insurance that's all right <unk> <unk> sections that we had to have to come over here um and ah our work has already hate us for it and i was wondering i i thought that maybe they weren't supposed to um so in other words we can pay it in any terms we want to write <unk> federal pay twenty five dollars a month until it's gone okay twenty five now they might after ninety days start giving you finance 'cause they do for me and i go to the same clinic no this is their mistake tell dad and i won't be alright answer either seventy five a month you know <unk> real good about that yeah and you know i could i could see the whole thing right up front but if they're willing to finance me i'm not gonna that's right when my boring after okay then secondly i'm <unk> jemilla <unk> do fifty if i have two but i'd rather twenty five well we'll try twenty five right okay i'll tell you if you have to do all right and then <unk> then <unk> dad to take it out the same day he takes up the memorials stone that's what <unk> that's what else i'm supposed to ask you about <unk> what how do you want that done i guess you almost three hundred yet just the same way a hundred a month old gone is that what is that what you been doing yeah then how come you didn't know that <unk> maybe because of this bill he's wondering if that was going to change things okay so hundred a month and <unk> knew the hundred a month on the on the memorial until it's done okay and i think it cording to dad you only have three hundred left <unk> right so then <unk> then <unk> but starting thirty the next time it takes it a memorial yeah also take out twenty five per <unk> under twenty five a month on beaumont until it's done all right so the beaumont is not going to affect the memorial okay that my dad was probably thinking but it's just not play the memorial for a couple of months <unk> <unk> yeah maybe but they're the ones that made a mistake so yeah that's right as long as your regular with <unk> they're real good about that i i told that i said you ought to call them i said that was over a year ago yeah almost a year that you're right about a year yeah yeah we got injected right before we yes and i said that's not right that they should have to pee that oh

<unk> oh this is an important one um [noise] maybe <unk> did <unk> tell you that i'm i'm selling raffle tickets no oh i'm from my rotary yeah <unk> yeah <unk> yeah um the the the proceeds <unk> boy's town local yet i know our local version <unk> it's a local version <unk> the the <unk> okay anyway the tickets there's eleven tickets in one booklet <unk> sell yourself ten and you get one free okay but the tickets cost hundred pesos which works out the four dollars okay her ticket so you tell yourself tan and you get one free so it's forty dollars per booklet okay would you sell a couple of books for me if i sent in books yeah and they're forty dollars the book yeah i mean don't buy 'em i mean rome right at four at four dollars a ticket you think it would be hard to sell tickets or not i'm just asking <unk> <unk> <unk> what did they get one of the prizes i'm the <unk> hear the first prize is a car second prize is a trip to hong kong and third prizes uh t._v. for <unk> there's <unk> there's twenty four prizes and those are um facts of rice so we would converting the cash oh i know i was thinking i was thinking two things either we could just send the cash or i could um use some of the cash money to send a gift and i would buy a gift and then use the remaining cash money you know for the postage right and some something kinda native right from here right now so anyway first prize uh gosh i have it in the letter it's first prize about fifteen thousand dollars oh boy yeah okay yeah and second prize is eight hundred dollars third prizes two hundred dollars and um [noise] the fourth prizes are about between thirty thirty five dollars a piece <unk> okay so that's what it would be okay are you going <unk> should i just to adrienne do lakers are just like like i would be able to sell to the family members and no you'd be able to sell to family ma'am okay so you're not see i i asked i told mom i was going to send a couple of books home to dad to make that send them she said no we'll just <unk> walk <unk> [laughter] okay she said well just buy a book okay so if you saw the family members <unk> for just one block or two books are just why don't you send to okay 'cause we're always doing fundraisers yeah always eating people up for money i mean constantly we just got done with one and i know we're coming up on another one and <unk> i know but this way you can say it's john's that's this is the say this <unk> this is because you don't have to buy magazines john and you don't have <unk> buy candy determined kids and then i send you the money back yeah or just give it to mom and dad and i put in my checking account well that's a good idea no should i should i send the whole ticket or do you want me just to send the tickets stops and then you send me back the filled up portion <unk> yeah i would think well yeah the people aren't gonna want to just fell on a job i think they're gonna want to see what the prizes their cars don't they just keep the ticket or you need the ticket no no no they keep the ticket and you send back to stop i was just thinking you know we wanna make sure stuff gets back <unk> if i assume to you now you'll get them within a week okay and then why don't you send them you know we'll give each other you know why don't you send them send them back okay bye bye mail let's say the third of january okay and then i'm sure to get 'em in time okay that sounds good is that okay yep yep so two books <unk> yep okay [noise] um let me see i forgot what the other thing was definitely wants to know is lee liked to be attitude books lead you like to be audited book do you like to be attitude book which book is that we sent how many <unk> reasons all it was all those books that they sent the other time yeah she loves it good she's going she's <unk> she's gone through almost every book we have in the house they believe that <unk> to go through the <unk> the bookstore i believe that that's the way yeah that's the way stephanie <unk> yeah she like she had those were nice and they were not too hard books and they were christian based books <unk> wish we could send you this other series that she's reading but hey we're almost all the time i remember the other thing what i'm <unk> what happens <unk> thirty minutes they come on and tell us i guess so that's what they said they do okay um anyway [noise] thank you for everybody who moved her stuff downstairs for mom and dad's [laughter] no was it really that big of a deal all with everybody just teasing that big of a deal it well you know who was teasing you learn <unk> right so but i mean is it is it because is it because the cedar chess was heavy and the germans heavy i was only gone to reno did larry declean really perceive that there's that much stuff yes there's not that much stuff yeah i mean when you think when you think that everything most precious to us we left home in case we ever had to leave here in a hurry right you know the things so i mean we i would like to see him move out of a house in store his things for four years i'd like to see how big of the room he wanted a half right you know so really i mean nobody else think bottle too much or anything well we just all kind of put up with him you know oh that's right that's right you recorded isn't it [laughter] and it could be probably [laughter] glad you've at it [laughter] no anyway the question was did everybody perceive it was a bunch of stuff or just lay it was just kind of thing and i didn't even as a bunch of stuff but <unk> the one that moved it all oh yeah i didn't really know how much <unk> as well you may get the opportunity to know my dad move again [laughter] no um i was gonna watch the tape again before i talked to dad so i will but i was wondering like against that you know the room that they created the spare bedroom yeah i was wondering if against that pack room or something they could build some shelf like larry and bar built in their basement i think so or like used to be built like we would give that a couple of hundred dollars right to have <unk> hey you know build the shelf and then i feel really really selfish about this but i've got <unk> those those blonde there's there's there's a blond cheer armchair for kids yeah and the little doll cradle and then a little park bench and the park benches real week it's about to break anyway about him blond cheer and adopting somebody made that for <unk> and the man is very very old what's adele what it's a park bench in a blond cheer and what else <unk> cradle cradle okay yeah yeah definitely the dog and you don't want all the kids playing with it right <unk> i don't i don't blame ya well it's just that the the park benches week and and someone would probably wanna toss it out but the man who made it is a is a close friend had a very already <unk> no we saw the bench <unk> okay <unk> okay <unk> during the phone and <unk> <unk> if it's tossed out he can make us another one 'cause he still has a little strenke left but something i'm serious <unk> something that this older man has done for all the kids and <unk> he does it probably given the church and <unk> <unk> it's just something that we would like the kids to have a long time so if you could kinda tucked pose away well that's <unk> yeah and if somebody could build from shelves i just think that stuff wouldn't get rummaged through as much i did that anybody go through the barrel i don't think so because when you were there when you were <unk> doing <unk> said oh and this one used to have closing it oh yeah and then this year <unk> i thought is that a slip with a tyrant does she joking [laughter] like the guy was joking because i know <unk> when you're <unk> you're kept a straight face kept <unk> it gets a straight voice and lori said i hope they didn't throughout the whole you know either i honestly don't know i know leery in uh i mean we feel that dumpster plus <unk> i know but looking looking at all the boxes that's about all their was okay i mean we really didn't have that much stuff and we were so careful with what we had

week like riding my psychologist serious <unk> yeah i just i don't really want to talk about it now but i don't even have to because <unk> whatever you don't have to you know the chance to it's just i don't know if you don't if you want to wait till the letter <unk> i'm sure like since you know we said well you could figure all that out but like i just wanted to go away ready like talking about is just you know <unk> mean uh-huh facts friends <unk> yeah mhm [noise] well like one more myself stuffed and <unk> you know uh-huh right so like i don't know <unk> stupid <unk> like self destructive and stuff like that <unk> i just learned little lessons today yeah scott's hard now i'm just kidding i'm i'm i i was when i got home yesterday from the concert i had a really nice time with mike evitt like half of the group is really strange and the other half like i like an even ashamed with her funny you know what i mean okay and i got back and i was really <unk> not excited to come back 'cause like i came home and i just like <unk> looked around my entry on my floor and i was just like i don't like the people are not friends with them and i have no friends here you know and <unk> was that's one of the things that i wanted to address uh but i don't ever want to talk about it anyway and <unk> like you know all depressed and like i sat in front of my psych looks like three hours and i like i couldn't read it because obviously it was like thinking you know and like whenever david has this theory and i think it makes a lot of sand i'm really mad at him by the way <unk> because the other <unk> haven't <unk> i mean he didn't call <unk> pay the trick is okay i'll tell him some and um he and he's like either <unk> but you have <unk> like you know you've <unk> you've never been so so so sad right i'm like that 'cause they don't do the extreme you know so so so happy so so so sad you know and he's like it's like a borderline extreme or you or me like oh this looks like <unk> <unk> what can you continue so i was like so then he he's like but i think one of the reasons is because leeza like you have emotionally like you're content because you have your close friends from before and at home you're not you don't have this emotional void you know and that's why like you're still fine i think it makes kind of like it makes sense that you could <unk> people around here like emotionally like i'm like i'm okay like you know <unk> that's like it's almost like i feel like whenever i do i like i feel like that weird like i feel like a wheel weird pull because because of that you know because deep down like i have that but still like it feels like there's <unk> you know mhm mhm so then i was like <unk> whatever i just thought about i think that it a lot a lot you know what can i do and all this stuff and like maybe i really can't relate to non jews maybe that's what it is maybe she said i'm i'm lucky with the people that around me i don't like they're not awful i just don't click within maybe it's because i'm a year older but i doubt that you know it's like the acting too much so quickly it's not so quickly any more you know and and it's the it's come to the extent like whenever anyone talks about their their their having friends like i don't understand you know for i get jealous or like like it's not gonna casual thing when someone else said yeah i went out with my friends i'm nice like you know same with me it's totally <unk> like there's like this little like little when that word like comes up this little like cringe or something you know like <unk> what i'm gonna say that <unk> what about like that and <unk> well yeah but i don't like their okay hang out with them other than <unk> like <unk> i kinda little i can i help just aren't you know after tour we will well i don't know like the normal people like i really like <unk> of course you know but whatever <unk> good i know she's going to call you <unk> yeah yeah and <unk> and um interview other but they're like a little too like girly for me you know <unk> in a sorority you know but like i like you know what i mean right anyway so still like we'll see what happens is that like <unk> you know the right sometimes you have to be more because i was trying to convince me to join the <unk> the girls' sorority like <unk> <unk> he didn't realize he was an a pie but um with this guy <unk> um you should join are you <unk> are you being serious and see what i was the extent like on friday night that i like says that people like <unk> make lots of friends that i i i don't want to do it i can't like just principally edges <unk> i could not be the sorority like somebody that's like there was just remember that i was like going to be what's it called rushing it i was like we're that come from it's like i don't know like what was your reaction when they told you that he's like a reason as good anyway point is um fudge all these feelings like nathan there and <unk> yeah <unk> i love nathan like but it's really good like we like we were talking like we we ate lunch either last week and that really really <unk> the same as you so much don't feel bad <unk> i'll let you talk <unk> okay let me finish though i mean i was like and i had to worry about all these things again like you know <unk> get her in the dean college we go to the hills you go yeah isn't that <unk> would ever look at when i go to the hill and <unk> like i don't care like you know i know everyone and like it's fine but um anyway <unk> today like once again like i when i went to eat with this guy <unk> feel like you guys <unk> the christian guy from english class and like i had like a nice conversation with him and like later and i had this other nice conversation with him and i and my entry way and tonight we had like a study break in my in my college like i was talking to people and meeting speed little sisters things and i wasn't what do you just miss those things no no so my point is and then i wasn't depressed as much anymore and like <unk> was it worth it to me so depressed last night you know what that means <unk> that happens name and things like switch really quickly isn't that you know but then it'll come right that like <unk> come back so quickly i think january she said to me i mean whatever i don't really talk too much anymore but like he's like has corny this sounds it's it's a good thing to be reminded like it's just not worth it to get depressed over things it's just not worth it you know what i mean that's such a stupid thing to say if you feel something you can't help like right but like yes but there's like wallowing in it and not you know there's like moving on are <unk> you can't <unk> that's the way that we'll go talk to me what about <unk> what's up with

like no i know i have one son i said so many people came last night but like <unk> it's still still felt like <unk> you have friends with you and then they'll do anything you're meeting and like of

feel more independent about yourself and more like even handle his own own right but you have to build that up i don't know how to do that especially since i like like you're a person and there are things that you want to do a dependent dependent of course but you know you're dependent on them for motion lee and everything like that but still you are you're a person like that i'll go off by yourself or if you're you can go right in your general you can go to that you can do that and you don't have to have so many things and that was actually like either i'm missing something i like you're not missing something 'cause you're doing something else that makes you happy you don't have to always be with the <unk> but that's the thing and people are going to like bonding like be friends leave you out forever you know like you'll end up i hate that i can see you know what i mean i can then i find myself like comparing you know i i can't do it any cats because people do like

said she would do it again she wouldn't have three she would have for uh we are having four oh you were going to matter of when my sanity will [laughter] wait a few more months [laughter] why why did she say that because [noise] three just doesn't work she said no i know if you're going to have three <unk> four well let's face it to look at rachel is five and a half years younger than <unk> right and seven and a half younger than sarah yeah and it's just too much of an age spread yeah so and i don't want her growing up in the only right so i probably will bad i did this is true but you know it's [noise] i know i know he goes pregnancy again i don't wanna oh my gosh yeah i do and i don't i you know i had a really she was wonderful i had a good pregnancy with her and everything and it was wonderful but <unk> mean having a baby again and i run around stuff i was out of that <unk> was [laughter] you know i'm into [noise] you know mom i want to have my friends over right and i want to do this it's just really isn't <unk> different yeah well she she had this cute age now too oh yeah she's real cute age i can imagine <unk> another one younger yeah some cookies on friday i babysat for eight <unk> they were one you know rachel and then one years old and two years old oh my gosh oh but the one year old and a two year old get along real well so it wasn't too bad yeah good but yeah i'm gonna start looking and doing something after the first year i need to get some money coming in here for myself <unk> i'm going crazy well yeah that's what helps with the babysitting you know they're gonna do babysitting here at home or there's a school that i know of um like a block and a half away and i called up because one the teachers there and went to kelvin oh yeah yeah and i used to sing with her over it um one of the churches i was at but anyway so i called their and anyway the principal call me back and he said they have an opening after the first year one day a week in the afternoon and i said well i have kids in my own w. problem you know that's not a problem for after school care yeah school for ten to fifteen kids <unk> just stay after school you know they play for a little bit and then they come inside and do their homework yeah it's gonna happen away and uh for three hours and then he says you know sometimes people call out sick yeah so but and then i thought you know i said the tone this with the school i was thinking about for jacob <unk> yeah so it's a private school it's a private christian school well [noise] i don't know if i want him going there or not it's a very fundamental school which is fine that i don't have a problem with but one of the philosophies or whatever it is about punishment uh-huh and they have a statement and they're saying that that we agree that it's okay for them for corporal punishment as long as there's one other adult you know <unk> room i don't i don't believe in that in time and i both teacher no excuses <unk> will leave the spanking off [laughter] but the thing <unk> what what you need to evaluate then is you know you know your child i mean like i don't believe that my children would ever do anything that would require them to be round car all there may be a time but you never know you you don't know and and i just um i like the same time i do like discipline but i don't think they need you know you're oh god yeah <unk> you're right <unk> so i don't have a hard time i would have a hard time <unk> but if you were there after school you kinda get an i know so i thought you know let me see there and see what it's like you know doesn't he's not going to be going to school for a few more years anyway but yeah you know it's a way to get your foot in the door maybe <unk> their philosophy will change <unk> did they tell you that our school system because they change the buses that used to be <unk> um first grade to eighth grade i went on the same bus and now they split it up now it's first before things weren't <unk> through eight oh that makes sense well so now the little kids start an hour later so they have free before school here you can drop your child off at seven o'clock in the morning cost a dollar for them to have cereal milk orange juice in many nothing no that's great and and it's free to our town so i've been having we've been having to go to meetings for sarah at school at at um at at seven thirty in the morning so a couple of times i've taken the kids there i can't believe now they have after school here as well but you have to pay for it right but that's a bargain [noise] well how many towns these i mean it's just and i'm surprised because not a ton of people use it mhm so just surprises me yeah but yeah <unk> that is a problem i think with a private school you really have to look at their philosophy and yeah and see there's only like one teacher per grade so i mean it's a small school yeah you know i figure if i go there and help out after school at least i can get a sense of the kids <unk> ten years and yeah you know i i would go i would take up you know so i have the application here and they got to do a criminal trials i don't care so yeah and um you know that's a good way to find out about <unk> teachers and yeah now that we've been fortunate we've i've been pretty happy with the public school here <unk> he would go to a public school around here but molly let me tell you they but they do pick up some interesting things have you ever heard of that book alexander's a horrible smell good very bad day low anyway there's a book out <unk> book <unk> and i was reading it to carl one night and he goes mom we visit me when i'm sarah's aged school and i said yeah and he went through the whole neighborhood you know all the way up to eighth grade i'm thinking yeah like you're gonna want me to visit you but yes i'll be there [laughter] then he goes to the <unk> the first day kindergarten when i first when i didn't know if i'd ever see you again and that was very horrible day i'm like oh my gosh [laughter] i mean that's what he got out of this one [laughter] it's a really cute buck about how kid has <unk> you know and he says i think i'll go to australia it's cute but but um that's what <unk> guy that book my oh my goodness you know you don't you don't know what kids thinking right and and i didn't know that that was that stress well you know yeah and i guess it is for a kid but you know and you <unk> but you don't know what goes through their heads carl is very vocal about things but sarah would never tell me she would she didn't talk did she she holds it all in yeah so but she's doing really um you know she's been <unk> for a learning disability at school and everything and um we've had her at a neurologist and and all that and she's really doing she's doing so much better and this summer she went for a oats occupational therapy called sensory integration and right now the know about that yeah yeah i learned a lot about that this summer and there are some kids <unk> freak out would well different sensory problems <unk> <unk> in this kid my child likes to bounce since then she's she's <unk> she's also been <unk> um the neurologist to um she's attention deficit but not the attention deficit where she runs around learned that that is not socially acceptable but she hasn't stopped running around inside her head [laughter] and um so so anyway the sensory integration has been i can't tell you how much i've learned about her would be you know like that <unk> would say to me your daughter's the type of child that does this and i would say i remember when she did that when she was two years old and and <unk> you know it really it's like i wasn't such a bad parent it was because of you know and she's um this neurologist it's been really good and <unk> you know she says there's gonna be fine when she goes up but we need to make it as easy as possible for her yeah and um the teacher was saying how well sara plans at school and she organized theirself and that's part of her goals is organization and <unk> planning and everything and i said but you chase the plane and she will not get it at first it will take her a long time and then they're all just said to us that's because they're smart enough to know that she has to organize herself in order to survive good and um well it sounds like she learned some coping skills already oh she has <unk> lot <unk> matter of fact they just pushed <unk> hadn't reading good because she's doing real well but um i just learned a lot about her and i just had carl evaluate about a neurologist because she said she would let us know and she said he has none of the motor problems that she had huh [noise] so it was just you know it's been nice this woman has really been on target for us we've i've learned a lot and of course their insurance won't let him go for o. t. anymore but she gets it at school but <unk> it's not as nice as the one that we were seeing down in massachusetts [laughter] so come this summer <unk> oregon and doing <unk> [laughter] so we have this bungee swinging our and our basement and i'm sure you're i'm sure jacob <unk> just love it begins and <unk> um bounces up and down and you can swing and um [noise] it's it's really it's like a huge for an older child it's like a a a deli jumper right and the kids love it they play down there my dad helped me both <unk> the ceiling of our basement that's a neat idea it's i'm going <unk> swinging our basement yeah and he put he figured out how to put a swim all because they use this <unk> climbing equipment to hang things at this <unk> place right but my dad's <unk> figure out a way and it cost us like fifty cents yeah and um it does just what it does at the place down in massachusetts where we would go so i'm i'm a big believer now in sensory integration i didn't know very much about it and i've learned quite a bit [noise] good so um but i am very hooked on believing that children really need to do [noise] you know i now i can see where you know when i kids that i take care of or whatever i <unk> sensory integration but [laughter] well then <unk> [noise] being in the field of em are too you know i you know <unk> you look at all these kids in the store or whatever you go oh gee i wonder if that person is registered here or there you know what are they getting speech therapy or or you know exactly my next door neighbor she's the only the kid <unk> he's got sensory integration up and down and then her daughter she has <unk> every morning getting dressed because she doesn't like <unk> the putting on clothes attacked she doesn't like tag she doesn't like snow pants 'cause they you know this and that and you cannot touched that kid lightly because she's ready to punch you out but you know and it's like <unk> this is so clear to me [laughter] yeah well <unk> oh i wish time would take some developmental classes in it which helps so much for jacob i mean yesterday oh we went to he wanted to go play tennis uh-huh fine well we're driving down there and there was nobody play tennis well that was bad so i said why don't you come with us we're going to go to the factory outlet to buy christmas decorations yet i had heard about yeah since i had on can you tell her to put a hat on please sorry [laughter] i said let's go so we went well one we

i <unk> 'cause sometimes i perceive especially when we first started talking that you're sort of struggling just speak english <unk> yeah i i am but but that's only because i just spent the weekend with four people and i would they only know spanish so where where were you this weekend in santa monica oh my gosh man you're i think i told you did i tell you i guess maybe did say you were going to

troops yeah do you ah actually know your new address i'm i'm i'm going to go there tonight to to settle things i know the street but i don't know the zip code so i'm i'm <unk> i'm going to do is is the only problem with this place and it's a big one is that there's no phone but i figured that i figured out how to work that the thing is is most all all it's going to change is is the number <unk> i wrote all this and the letter <unk> okay <unk> i'll just tell you <unk> <unk> i'm going to give you a new number and then i'll just go they have these stores are phones where people use the phone because a lot of people don't have phone yeah i read that in the in the book yeah and so all our dinners at nine o'clock i'll go there and then <unk> and i'm so much closer to the this old city <unk> any itself i'm not like off in the boondocks anymore and this <unk> so it it'll be like a two minute walk and i'll just go there at nine you know yeah are these girls students or how they're students and and they're <unk> they're studious and then they're really i like um yeah so good yeah i think i think i know it'll be better <unk> and you're taking credit no i mean i couldn't pass the test to save my life you know even if you could <unk> you would you probably get some <unk> book your we're <unk> i'm not <unk> the problem is i'm not in in an in an american university right now <unk> i maybe i mean we're going to go she gets <unk> and and and it wouldn't be worth the fight though probably here yeah and and getting everything signed here and getting them to take it officially little are you getting <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> should <unk> <unk> yeah i will <unk> somebody's little <unk> six <unk> actually i've had to send all that to the rotary because they they've had to had to have a lot of papers for the next <unk> thing for the <unk> yeah you know <unk> resources in what's going on with greg and susan oh well we have um you know friday was susan's birthday but we haven't um we didn't have never have she caught her life phone hoping somebody but also there's <unk> there's <unk> book into town what does that mean back in california los angeles yeah he's been gone all the time yeah he's been in atlanta ever since you know oh my god [laughter] [noise] <unk> chicago <unk> drinking gigs little money he's about to barrio cuter through the oh good he's been wanting to move that into that direction yeah yeah and i said well i think he's just now finally getting enough information about what the get like probably just now feeling like maybe <unk> something he'd produce would be we're <unk> we're doing it on yeah she's <unk> nothing's been heard about that too spaniards that are over there no okay and i forgot you know we did we have talked to him since he went back and i he was only hear weaker week and a half so he shouldn't have missed them or anything but yeah the asking my doubt that he heard from we haven't heard from <unk> month <unk> <unk> oh oh is that when i hit <unk> forgot oh you're so they talk about it and he said anything about any and read it up i didn't read it because i have some other <unk> oh okay and uh no i just remembered [laughter] i guess greg is pretty much decided he's gonna just stay at depaul and and ah you know finally now that he's had the back seat to this forty year old piano player that guy's moving on so they said <unk> could be there may may end [laughter] oh my god that is wonderful well yeah i think he's <unk> <unk> you know <unk> slipped and and you know <unk> you're right i think he likes it and uh there really isn't any greek reasons for him <unk> well yeah you still have people there to work with <unk> you'll probably good too <unk> <unk> if he's the main man there he's gonna do well i think so i do yeah and you think you should move on <unk> no not really yeah the only other way would move worn would be to go out to california though <unk> it gets a little scary i think he needs a couple more years yeah well and one of his teachers has told him that will do you think you oughta go on for <unk> masters yeah i mean he's if he's going to be there for two years you might as well get the paper <unk> his reasoning and meanwhile we watch the turnover fresh food yeah oh he's feels at home there now and and <unk> that's good yeah you know <unk> think its positive that she have a experiences <unk> she looks back or positively right for the critical yeah yeah yeah it's <unk> it's it's fun to challenge yourself but you don't want to be in a constant state of challenges you probably are for this year [laughter] yeah there's times i tell you that that i i understand what it is to miss people now <unk> really good do you miss us i mean i used to miss people before <unk> but it wasn't like we go far that there was nothing anybody could ever do right right and so you get to dreaming don't dream but <unk> it is definitely a different feeling you know i mean i always knew that if if i needed to i could <unk> right yeah <unk> i could always remember back some times would be a way for a long time dream of saddam's rule home clue [laughter] oh yeah yeah well <unk> anyway when you get if it gets too too bad <unk> <unk> for a little world using <unk> because it's <unk> good for <unk> food <unk> [laughter] yeah i mean there's beautiful things about this place and and i mean you can go to the market and buy amazing food [laughter] you know it'll be missing <unk> yeah you will i'm sure yeah i know it's really kind of terrible what's worse 'cause you're in between <unk> two places <unk> yeah those places or something else <unk> may work with you <unk> after about six months you may become amazingly well see that's <unk> some point i i felt i felt i felt that already <unk> <unk> i mean not completely but a little bit and that's what i'm saying is is a little bit <unk> not not as little unsettling can you really really miss that <unk> home <unk> new york to go in and out the music colleges where you could go jokes <unk> [laughter] yeah really that's what it opens right i mean when there's such great things in in all the places you go to you know i mean but but you don't really belong anywhere except one place that yeah but when you start to belong one <unk> into into the other places then it it's scary well the interesting thing is in recent years walter has has i mean you're i'm i don't know whether your dad gets the same age or not but i always felt like he sort of seem to belong everywhere but now he self perceives that he doesn't really really feel like he belongs all these other places where he can survive you always <unk> feels like he's with american right i'm <unk> i'm completely american i really do believe that and i know that as i get older i'm gonna want to be in the united states you know <unk> <unk> it's <unk> it's home [laughter] yeah exactly yeah i saw missy and her mother at the mall and it just got to say hi to them what's she doing she married <unk> she's still managing the store and all and <unk> one is getting married [laughter] oh i figured the same short yeah i met somebody yeah yeah <unk> in august and michael off short guy

apartment <unk> i mean <unk> working for the medical exam moved but but <unk> really he's only gonna be here one of my mind and at this point he's studying constantly <unk> so i i just prefer to have more contact with people sure yeah so you you just <unk> taking the place of the girl of your friend no <unk> i forgot to finish his <unk> she just told me about it because she had looked at it but it wasn't for what she needed because she needed something <unk> you <unk> your <unk> your <unk> are you playing still no i don't i don't have access to one <unk> would you be when you're <unk> oh no no i'm moving to our worst price better location and the better situation but <unk> wouldn't <unk> were worse in the sense i mean it's not nice it's not big it's not it's more what you think of at the place i live right now it's like <unk> i mean it's like a house well well it's not a a safety on the streets oh it's fine they were who through <unk> yeah and you don't know whether it be a few out over the neighborhood or <unk> florida <unk> and and things and they don't have <unk> really i mean unless you're you have a big house and it's it's a luxury here yeah so the piano the music stores situation than that <unk> it can work i mean but you have to i <unk> i have to it takes more like three <unk> three hours to get one hour oh because you have to walk there you have to make the reservation them um and times or you can't get in and and then you have <unk> worry a little bit about losing your technique and so yeah it's it's not that great of a situation for that for all that probably would have to build you didn't take the little we're <unk> we're <unk> we're not this thing <unk> technique so now it's completely different but i don't know i don't know exactly what to do about that <unk> there are so the the university itself for truly doesn't have any like i mean there's nobody there is a piano major apparently know yeah it's more i read the book and yeah so even

speakers <unk> while they're on the phone huh [laughter] i have like twinkies principals and shit on my desk <unk> oh <unk> oh my god enough canada sinking ship [laughter] and so i guess it's um u. penn is doing this linguistic thing so they were like surface you've been chosen [laughter] i saw an ad and like it's a you get paid by like okay [laughter] well i should do that [laughter] yeah [laughter] i know it's so cool now like whenever i'm looking at research stuff from all like okay how are they doing this techniques [laughter] every time i've done this like department experiments or whatever we don't get paid for those here we get credit for <unk> psych class oh yeah they do like that here but also like other subjects uh oh that sucks well here's like extra source of income [laughter] planet right because <unk> pigs liver and and <unk> special wasn't that <unk> become a guinea pig and yeah there's like <unk> the experiment all the time and they got tired of it's they went back to after [laughter] i don't know but [laughter] it was [noise] although i think i was like probably sick at home watching delirious maybe i'm still recovering lemonade that's all i know in the sure it's gonna be really gross [laughter] yeah probably oh i'm so tired and they oh huh <unk> no oh speaking of pennsylvania i picked up like this uh [noise] well i was that was one place that i was thinking of transferring to but since i haven't filled <unk> transfer applications i'm assuming it won't be doing this but [laughter] but i'm looking at grad school should english and they were like ranking than the u._s. news and world report thing in berkeley it was number one but i'm a penn was up there in columbia was there too but i want to go to columbia i'll probably apply to pen maybe but i would rather <unk> mean <unk> in philadelphia but i'd rather go to new york mm so i just thought that was interesting 'cause i'm like oh my god my friends are i would love it if i went to grad school in berkeley but [laughter] i would i'd probably won't be your the yeah you're not going to stay rolling up well okay um well because starting like next semester i basically be living on campus and i figure by the time i hit senior year whether i stay that last semester and mhm i will have like met everyone within the department i will has participate in a budget experiment elvis they know the apartment really well and i want to get a chance to like know other places well too you know so i mean i might come back here for like a p._h._d. thing if they ever accept me [noise] but yeah plus that the other thing i don't think that except for grad school why um because i don't know i don't have a four point oh and they also don't particularly like to bring back their own um and it's like department oh um and so i wouldn't like to see what other people that <unk> you know so if my grades improved maybe mit are you chicago if not maybe u._c._s._d. chicago's nice <unk> cold yeah no [laughter] my cousin teaches at davis i think and like <unk> genetics or something i'm not even sure yeah you mentioned that yeah <unk> it's really pretty now that for the first time this um this fall it is really pretty well he's lucky then [laughter] why am i so tired oh my god [laughter] it's like we have a i just studied i think didn't really get much done [laughter] same here but i just didn't even bother studying [laughter] about it i don't do much but that's okay it was all snowing it's like a big blizzard like i didn't leave the room wanted <unk> one of the days well i went down to give the delivery guy his money but like other than that i did not leave the room except to go to the bathroom i think sorry one should be but [laughter] she didn't think it was healthy i don't know why but [laughter] i was like if i were at home i can do this for weeks it's not even leave the house like during summer i'll realize i'm like wow it's been like seven days i haven't even been outside [laughter] except to go to work maybe but <unk> that's what you were getting out okay we're going to go up to boston huh we're definitely going over to providence i want to even check out new york i wanna go to maybe like um one of the art museum <unk> not a day trip yeah something new york it's so expensive yeah like i probably won't have the money [laughter] that kind <unk> like good <unk> i haven't been to new york in a long time i'm not going to be able to go for like a long time so that would be able to maybe my mother will go with us and she'll <unk> she'll take a shopping [laughter] now see i don't think i have money for that actually <unk> ah not that my mother has my like my parents are going for one day with our neighbors cool and then i don't see why we can't go to boston that's no problem no yes and then they basically take for granted we're going to boston katie [laughter] and i have a friend in rockport that she transfer to connect college and i told her i going to go see her but <unk> through the new year's eve when i was like i don't know if i'll be able to do that but <unk> it's near gloucester when my roommate was actually a live north of boston she's awesome liz she transfer to college and <unk> well she was actually <unk> girlfriend last semester [laughter] so we've been having a conversation [laughter] been around huh <unk> been around yeah i don't know i wouldn't say that <unk> was and i are very much alike only been through never mind that you're talking about somebody else no no no but listen i ever actually a lot of the guys that have like all <unk> all the guys at school like who have like this or like the same people it's really strange were very much alike and like we're becoming really good friends <unk> last semester but then she liked transfer so [laughter] so it was just weird but we've covered been really good friends such you not left i transferred probably not <unk> i haven't done anything about it or you kind <unk> like where you are now huh i'm just whatever [laughter] now actively <unk> you know i'd probably be better if i were junk but [laughter] you know that's <unk> a lot of students that <unk> i don't know how you know <unk> i probably won't 'cause i haven't done it so <unk> who flew overlook the semester and then we'll be kicking myself for not having transferred to boot [laughter] is it possible to transfer just like the last year or does anybody <unk> is it really worth it [laughter] i'd probably take like six you got to college and [laughter] you can try graduate <unk> <unk> i don't know if i'd be able to i mean actually i have a ton of credits but like <unk> i haven't like fulfilled many how many minutes from my major how many classes life <unk> okay let's see one to to [laughter] to basically filled <unk> know two three two <unk> three i think yeah saturday <unk> says to me i haven't done any requirements i have two majors [laughter] i'm like well the thing that sucks that i could have declared english major my freshman year and that would <unk> cool i would've been all set except i decided not to declare yet i was i mean i should just declared and if i wanted to change just change yeah 'cause then they implemented this requirement called the classical one ninety k. that it's called introduction to literary studies <unk> not what i'm looking for men okay so i have to take this class and if i had declared as a freshman wish i could have because i came in for selling all my like requirements for <unk> for the <unk> like you had your <unk> you have to keep take college writing and i got out of it with the test over like break over the uh orientation i mean so i would have been all set but no i was stupid [laughter] oh why [laughter] so i have to take that next semester and which means i can't take a lot of other classes until it's filled <unk> <unk> yeah so like i was signing up last semester for all these classes and they're like sorry you're not eligible and like [laughter] like i don't think so okay like i'm for porno you should make allowances or [laughter] that'll never happen [noise] it'd be nice though i would be nice yeah her you know i'm sure like if i really i don't know like what everyone takes <unk> writing class and but <unk> but like if i had gone like say i'd gone the first day and was like hey if you don't have if not enough people find out can i come in but i'm sure like that's completely filled you know yeah so um so i'm taking a writing workshop next semester it's it's like it's actually i <unk> i <unk> i didn't even know it was in the course booklet it is it just made by arrangement i saw a sign language <unk> for like five different possible workshops so i signed up for one it's on thursdays from like four to six which means all being <unk> from like noon to eight thirty on thursdays next semester which is not [noise] but um so i signed up for that and it's only once a week and it's tough fail so i have four english classes in six credit japanese cost that means that one day <unk> so but the <unk> thing it's just like i'm not even worried about it like that's like my own personal enjoyment so [laughter] that's like an extra curricular activity in mine [laughter] yeah pretty much look out for a tendency to make up a weight training class because i didn't go to like one more than we are allowed to like i didn't go to for <unk> you can only go to three that making <unk> that was going <unk> i didn't make <unk> tried to go they were going <unk> all those years a pass fail <unk> oh see i i might drink last ended today and i've missed five and like that's you're only allowed three but then like i'm somehow i was allowed five i don't know how that <unk> figured out and i swear i didn't miss five classes but they're telling me i didn't i don't have a record so i'm like okay but i guess we get extra points if we've improved are technique or weight training [laughter] so i'm all set like today was my last class funny so like yeah but i i get we get grades like you get <unk> some people <unk> brought down because they like skip like field hockey or something [laughter] i know a girl could have had a four point oh like last semester she got a three point eight because she's skip like ten <unk> oh like was it worth it [laughter] as far as you can say like either pass fail a grade but i just said forget it i'm not going to like bring down because i was i don't want to go to this i don't want to do this assignment i passengers like do some weight training stuff you know <unk> option yeah glad i did like a c._n._n. yogurt weeks [laughter] i was just funny 'cause she's like you have <unk> five i'm like half the people that are in the class i see like every three weeks and i'm here all the time [laughter] i can't have missed all these classes i mean like three i was definitely syrup i'd miss maybe four i'm like but not five [laughter] i'm so like no i don't think so but i couldn't really argue 'cause i didn't really have like alibis girl [laughter] i missed so i don't know but i'm glad it's over i'm just like trudging the snow likes wet and i'm like gross and i'm just a big hassle especially i live on this big hill and it's like directly like this far away as possibly possibly could be [laughter] that's terribly convenient [laughter] i'm on campus like i mean

nature so he recommended travelling beforehand that would be they they said because we had to hire since <unk> substitute you're lucky you know i thought i i actually didn't believe in providence at that time but <unk> but <unk> coincidence would have it at that time or now i look back on it and i see that providence would would have it that um that i had the time i had a few months to travel so i didn't have time to go round the world so i decided to come to israel and and go through the middle east i started in greece and cypress <unk> came to israel and i'm down <unk> ahead of time with your real purpose was or were you just know through the <unk> yeah i was just <unk> i had spent six weeks on the road <unk> by the time i came to jerusalem i'd been through <unk> and then and cypress and i was traveling i began the travels with my mother um and <unk> and i uh went on all alone and i visited a cousin in tel aviv and they came to jerusalem and um they're in jerusalem i i happen to meet a guy who i had a a non jew who i had met um earlier <unk> traveled living cypress and i was staying he showed me his utah stolen uh by the damascus gate if i sell utah stone wherever staying and then um that day providence would have it that i that i went to um the <unk> the western wall and they're at the war i was met by a a buy a jew who asked me if i would put on just stay i'm <unk> out of out of courtesy and i i apologize i said i'm sorry i didn't realize that um you know that that that should be done and he said would you like two <unk> would you like to go for a shop <unk> meal and then they had a um jewish family and i said okay and um and he introduced me to someone and he introduced me to a rabbi who set me up for a shabbas meal at a um at a religious family eye <unk> eye <unk> your name is <unk> i'm sorry i'm my name is rick i'm sorry <unk> rick rick yes cave and uh yes do you have a brother in jerusalem uh no i don't i only have a sister she lives in seattle she with <unk> with the adult i'm sorry another rabbi is asking me questions so and um [noise] so um so i asked myself when i was asked would i like to go for i i at first i was quite weary i'll tell you i was quite wary of like brainwashing of coats you know <unk> like you know my i grew up in a secular humanist background i grew up in a semi cooperative community and i went to oberlin college which was very liberal college right and very openminded person yeah that was a very open minded person i was i was i was seeking truth not religion [laughter] um but i thought to myself when i was offered this opportunity to go for a a shabbas meal at a religious family i said why not you know i said i'm i'm traveling to learn about myself in the world and when <unk> and which i live not to just sit on beaches and go to discotheques from different countries so why not you know i mean we're in a little bit i was a little frustrated in six weeks i've been traveling i just met tourists idea i didn't know greek i didn't know turkish so you know i met tourists and what's the point of it all anyways right you know going from one beach and having you know basking in the sunshine what's the point of it all that's right <unk> higher purpose that's right you weren't born just to soak up son that's right exactly so i i um i said here's an opportunity to see how a jewish family lives why not and providence would habits that they were with a june night there was <unk> that friday night there were some over a hundred people who were going on a tour and who were set up for <unk> hospitality and this rabbi rabbi boruch within sent me to um a rabbi simcha wasserman the corner <unk> rest in peace he was a a great rabbi whose father was one of the greatest rabbis in europe who um [noise] and he himself was very knowledgeable rabbi and i was told that i i i um was was gonna i was going with three other boys to a a a rabbi's home rabbi who you know who had lived in europe and lived in america so i i don't remember exactly what <unk> thought thirteen years ago but i can can conjure up some what an image of like a little bit of what i might have thought i was afraid that down and [laughter] that you know i'm going to this rabbi's house and he's gonna chastize <unk> santa fe you jewish boy what are you doing with your life you say you should do something with your life for a change you should learn some torah what are you <unk> what is that you just you just um <unk> your fifth in university what is this you know why don't you something for <unk> yeah <unk> so when i got there it was i was pleasantly surprised to see nothing off the sort <unk> that was president surprised to see an older rabbi and his wife who bantered with each other playfully you know it's clearly deeply in love 'em and i can't remember exactly what the rabbis that but i remember the impression that i had that had as i said i was like a little bit on the defensive a little bit afraid of you know being dragged into some cold i didn't know anything about <unk> traditional judaism [noise] um and so how did he approached me like <unk> offensively i think i would have been on the defensive i would've retracted but because he just was interested you know he was he just opened himself up he opened up his home it was beautiful it's beautiful meal and the beautiful environment and he just opened up his his life to us yeah um i you know he and he i could tell he felt like a little bit <unk> almost he felt sorry for <unk> yes and i i thought to myself you know i i i can express some of the thoughts that i might have felt that that time that you know you feel sorry for me rabbi i'm private <unk> honors going for a doctorate and [laughter] and one of the top universities in clinical psychology you know i'm i i have a future ahead of me and you live in a small apartment in jerusalem you know you're you're an older rabbi and you feel sorry for me so but he made me feel as if he's got a jew or not i don't think he was trying to do it you know in any um subversive manner he he just made me feel that that that he he wishes he could share something with me but it's unfortunate that he really can't because of my lack of education so i was looking like i was trying to get a glimpse like what he's what he's holding there what kind of pearl he's holding there which really that pearl was was judaism you know he he was he was holding a very meaningful life you know he he um i i was looking i was a person who was looking for spirituality as a person for who was looking for teachers in my travels in life and i'd met some you know um some friends and some older people in my travels that that i considered wise people who <unk> could learn from this was the person who i right away identified as as a truly wise person he like you had windows which <unk> you know his eyes were like windows to his heart which just spoke there it just spoke <unk> a deeper meaning in life yes i didn't even know what the time that unfortunately he lost his entire family and the holocaust and then he didn't have children and his name <unk> simcha wasserman <unk> joy hebrew and he was truly a joyful person he he told me i return many many times too it's home after that first night and then i make much sense help with someone who had experience such tragedy and heartache the full of joy because he believed deeply and how <unk> in in god leading the universe and he told me that although he doesn't have children of his own he's got children all over the world and he he said that he has children who send him you know his students that says and the <unk> the helmet that your your students are like your children yeah and she has <unk> students who would send them <unk> wedding invitations because they considered him like <unk> their father and and i considered him in many ways like my father i i considered him he he was such a beautiful man he passed away a few years ago but he he he was a man who was able to touch many many people in the very delicate way in a very <unk> offensive on obtrusive manner <unk> and i'm just the way i said that that you know just by educating them that that you know just telling them this is torah and and not not trying to convince them not trying to convert them you know <unk> i mean a jew with a jew whether he knows it or not but but anyway not you know not trying to get a person to do something against their will or um you know um the way that i that i that i look at that as it someone who's truly connected to god wouldn't eat the same other people because you know as you know from psychology to me that comes from from the ego needing to be right and when you're connected with god you can be um a channel of vehicle for god's you know for the essence of god and that light becomes visible to the person that you're a connecting with and just as the um rabbi open up their hearts in their home to you and you thought that they might shame you know into doing better <unk> whatever they were really expressing the light of god through them and it's it's very difficult you know to not open up to that kind of of of energy and and and light right i mean it's <unk> um again like i i know that the <unk> there is a view of these type <unk> all the other line um it could be i don't know i think <unk> <unk> we can just ignore it okay [noise] um [noise] i think there's a view of of this type of um yeshiva or you know these type of settings as as something that's trying to um brainwashed or something you know <unk> a person and i really don't see it that way i i as a i i see it as just i'm a person you know that <unk> rabbi did to me he sort of opened up his life to me sure well i you know i i don't um you know when <unk> when i first went to the you see them it was a very different setting than i was used to when i you know perhaps i didn't look upon it as a cult but i looked upon it is um something very intense and now i look at it and you know as a perhaps a form of brainwashing and that it washes your your your brain your <unk> your soul clean so that you can see the the truth of god more quick really because it's you know when you were brought up in in traditional culture i mean i think that as a cold i mean you know you're brainwashed to believe certain things you believe to um live a certain life you're <unk> you're you're you're you're given certain beliefs that you think give your life meaning you know buying more things believing certain things when in fact you can live a very meaningful life contributing to other people's lives without having much material goods and um you know those are different values than most of the world teachers <unk> as you know i mean i i myself ah you know have <unk> have looked at different paths and i find that each pat has given me some very valuable for <unk> sure one minute they're sure the other ones are okay hello <unk> yes i'm still here yes there there's a pause rabbis talking to someone else on the other one [noise] [noise] yes i'm still here or there should only be a minutes away and we'll get back to speaking hopefully very i'm sorry okay yeah so i'm one of the things that i um you know i i i spent um well actually three months at the <unk> when <unk> when <unk> was there rabbi ah no wind <unk> yes yeah that was like quite a number of years ago yeah he's been before i came right yes and also there was another rabbi there i don't know if he's still there he um he had a clinical psychology background rub after lunch check monday or it could be um he was more um i think he was the only rabbi there with a psychological the psychology background but i believe his first name was fill fill up rubber philip and perhaps that was his name is he's still there um no i don't think <unk> i'm not sure if that's the one you know and then they would have <unk> and you know you you you you were mentioning that um you know through providence you met certain people right and i'm in my travels i don't know if you're <unk> if you're familiar at all with the um city yoga people at all of 'em was rami bob uh moved to non <unk> know okay well um i find a lot of common things between certain practices and <unk> and <unk> and believe it or not um i mean and also there's a lot of misunderstandings between what certain religions truly are about even people's understanding of what judaism is truly about <unk> because it's you know it's so easy to i'm confused the forum for the essence mhm and what i uh what i believe now is that most of us think we know the reasons why we do certain things when in fact <unk> directing the show and i had the experience of truly experiencing that i was not in control of my life that that i believe that i knew why why i was doing certain things when in fact i was being directed for a higher purpose mhm and um do you know the word cohen uh not the jewish were cohen but the japanese were cone k. o. a. n. or a question that you're rational mind cannot answer or they have a question that your mind cannot answer rationally that the answer does not lie in the rational domain do you know that word cone no i don't know the word i i understand the concept you're saying but they like what is the sound of one hand clapping you know those kinds of quest uh-huh uh-huh so the question that i was left with recently and and no matter where i go i'm always looking at you know what is you know what does the higher purpose of what's going on here the question that i was left with uh when my car recently had a flat tire and so i was sitting in a waiting room and i was very tired so i put myself into very contemplate of state and i said to myself you know it looks like things are going against me right now you know why is this happening wise that happening and the question that i asked myself as how <unk> all these things be happening and yet in another way everything is perfect from god's perspective <unk> and so i was sitting there thinking from my perspective things to not look right it looks like i'm like life is not fair <unk> god's perspective how is it you know what is going on here that um i am where i need to be mhm and if i were to look from a higher perspective that things would make sense and spiritual way and sometimes i think in perhaps you've thought of is that when what looks to be a bad thing happening to you do you ever think you know if i was in another place perhaps things would be even worse than this was god's compassion that he's showing it on me mhm by you know let's say giving me a flat tire and putting the in a fire <unk> right <unk> <unk> think of those things sure sure i've had um actually one of the <unk> i'm i'm teaching now <unk> after you know after many years of studying uh i i guess i could just briefly <unk> finish my uh sorry my my story [laughter] after that night like um after that night uh at that rabbi's house i just you know i i was in deeply impressed then i gradually um [noise] i heard about that <unk> <unk> and i came to hear a philosophy professor there was a a professor here a doctor <unk> <unk> <unk> got labor former festival philosophy from john's hopkins university yes and um and i decided i had enjoyed <unk> many philosophy lectures and that <unk> oberlin and i wouldn't be interested in hearing the jewish philosophy a class and he gave they are very stimulating class <unk> actually i even remember the subject it was on the individual it's <unk> versus a community is a person in adam who lives in and out of my world you know <unk> they're they're just <unk> everyone has an individual who binds together for certain purposes or as a person part of a team yeah he's a person part of a community does the person <unk> they're they're <unk> they're essence by being part of a team i'm being like an orchestra so i asked him afterwards well you know maybe i'm i was a very strong individual less than i am so so the states [laughter] um i believe that a person can't really experienced the deepest pleasures uh of another person or the pain you know even the husband <unk> semi the father of ah children and although i can empathize with my wife i can't really go through childbirth with her completely she has to go through the physical pain and she <unk> she experiences much more joy that my experience but um [noise] i i asked them afterwards he gave <unk> very strong argument that a person is although they retain a strong individual component they're part of a team they're <unk> they're part of community they have they have a responsibility to to the greater community like they they're not <unk> they're not an ivory tower person living like alone and you know ah independent from the community they they they <unk> as you said even in a secular society they're very much affected by the world around them and they oh things to that world [noise] so um i asked him afterwards let's say you know it's given example of young beethoven who comes to his parents and say i want to be yeah i want to be you know they they knew he had talented music and he wants to be another mozart you know he says i want to be the next <unk> laughing they say that's ridiculous you can't be another mozart you know he was a genius he was he he was brilliant you you want to be a musician too but <unk> the orchestra needed to play or do something practical so think of the tragedy had beethoven become <unk> play rather than <unk> than than a pianist and composer yeah so he said well there are some times where the community doesn't understand what's what's best for it but he's but beethoven as <unk> even if he if he rebelled against his parents and became a pianist rather than an impractical <unk> rather than a than a practical to player would be serving the community he would be helping the musical community and helping the world and creating his in in bringing out his strengths to the dust ability [noise] so i heard that class and i was you know deeply impressed by the level um which was taught and then afterwards student asked me what some <unk> you know <unk> came up to me and said what's my name and where am i going to they're going to the galley the golan egypt turkey my doctorate my internship [laughter] professor you've got the wrong guy probably not going to rent <unk> too don't waste your breath so then um it happened afterwards he said i'm sorry you know i mean [laughter] brushing nothing you know i'm so afterwards i just came back and i i you know i kept on thinking about the place like the next day i was thinking about leaving jerusalem and but i kept on thinking about this place you know it was really interesting class maybe i should go back for another class and um and i said why not you know like <unk> <unk> after own travel i'm torn about myself and learn about the road <unk> caught myself that i was afraid of the place i was afraid of something there and so i said you know look i have to be a little wary of brainwashing but but except for that you know i i i'm a guy who can handle myself and um and maybe i'll learn something so i came back and i <unk> i i sat in on a few more classes and each one was very very satisfying very stimulating and then um you know i decided that <unk> you know after all i'm traveling to earn so why don't they spend a few days here and learn and then i started going through like ups and downs like this is this the truth or is this the truth if this is the truth then i should you know i should start to study it i should i should learn about it and it's answering more questions than all my studies the philosophy and literature and psychology and different thoughts in the world than anything i'd seen but i said but then there was this voice saying that but what about you know the chinese restaurant i won't be able to get a chinese restaurant when my family [laughter] and it's ridiculous that sounds like i just was afraid of what <unk> what the implications of studying too much with me and on my lifestyle yeah and i decided well i'm going to be brave and take it day by day and see you know i i really think that i i was a person who was searching and i was a person who was not going to accept something blindly [noise] i i was i wanted to debate i i did debate with people quite actively and um so i took it day by day and i went through my ups and downs you know <unk> like one day i would walk out of class and say <unk> you know i never believed in truth <unk> had resolve myself to be an existential left because the truth <unk> didn't make sense to me truth like was anti intellectual <unk> anti rational right irrational truth weaving an absolute truth was something that just didn't make sense to me and my education up to that point [noise] and so i'd resolve myself to be an existential <unk> you know we live in a world where we have to create our own truth mhm because because truth just didn't <unk> there was nothing that suggested itself of an absolute truth <unk> made any sense to me and all of a sudden i was confronted with a question <unk> that maybe absolute truth does make sense yes and so i um so i went through quite a a you know i i went through my ups and down there at the beginning and then i just decided that look i'm not going to i see these questions are very very deep um these are questions which have been debated for centuries and maybe i'm not it's bright as i think i am and maybe i'm not going to resolve all over the world's deepest philosophical questions on one foot so you know just the <unk> i think we have about two or three more minutes or two or three more they'll try to sum it up yeah do you have any more questions <unk> so let me just try to summer so then then i'm that i'm that point i i just decided

things and doing surgery is opposite caught but wow touching though for oh he sure been through it hasn't and i'm like oh well you know it's just amazing that he's come back it's been about a year oh there's a a real will to live after <unk> before you know i'm not sure how it was such a shock and awe will sometimes people don't really have a warning for these things and i have on my refrigerator this scripture about teaching us to number our days it's from some ninety i don't know if you can remember that but you know ninety i always thought gee <unk> <unk> yeah if we could live to be ninety that's old that my poor mom was only sixty five i thought wow you know i'm going to inherit half of her genetic own background so that made me um effective the fifteenth i'm no longer in active reserves the room or in my unit was we were going to get called up on the eighteenth anyway and i thought oh i can't live with that guy <unk> <unk> i don't believe in what they're doing over there i think it's wonderful if the people would like to try to um have peace with each other but sure you know my father in law's told me all these stories about world war two and he said even the nazis didn't like the serbians they wouldn't get along and i thought oh gracious you know <unk> our country we have so many problems here with our schools and the way our older people are treated him oh i know i don't think our country should spin what did they say no six billion over there and <unk> only oh maybe it's just two billion i get the billions confused with the number of land mines and how much money weren't an offensive but um i'll still be on a like a call up list if they need a dietitian but oh my goodness you know <unk> i'm not gonna you know <unk> my responsibility <unk> certainly not going to go really i thought too many body bags coming back when i was in high school twenty years ago and you know it is a cycle the world is on cycles <unk> the yeah cycling yeah i don't want to get off the topic but i'll tell your husband i said you know high and gosh oh i'm sure when you have <unk> so well oh yeah yeah she does she look <unk> words and read things <unk> love <unk> yeah loves the cat in the hat and i'm the lifetime handle this morning there was this special with <unk> leach about toddler play time [noise] water okay <unk> i'm <unk> you don't let them <unk> time don't fit the children into your idea of play they have more fun with just you know the boxes and so really i i've been <unk> adjusting pretty well the all of this but i tell you i don't know how people do that years and years ago when they had like seven or eight of 'em and oh i had three at well yeah i know at home you know but <unk> but i enjoyed it looking back on it was very frustrating in a way if there was anything else you wanted to do like even if you want to go into the library saying that it was their address three children off you know to my mom even has a friend that came to visit her that was part of a family of she said either twenty or twenty one i said mom you gotta be kidding she said no that honest to goodness they have that many children back you know those years and i said how would you keep your mind you and i remember when i first met you though and you were real positive about the whole thing and i thought she wants to be a dietitian she's crazy there's so many other things you could do but i'm really glad you around the administrative side now 'cause that's where the money is at and you'll learn a lot more i don't know about the money and that's <unk> good <unk> and the only handling the budget <unk> knowing how much yeah <unk> <unk> it's a little more <unk> it's a lot more analytical yeah i think like dealing with the average person with their distress over what they're getting on their trays i mean a lot of times you know even after i have a thing on quito genet died i mean to send you to them and even after all these years that's pretty much what we were still doing and that's why i decided to cash in my chips when i had colleen because i thought oh this is not gonna change i can come back in ten years it'll be the same thing [laughter] and she had never been so cute again you know i know oh i think you you this will be the happiest time with the children in my opinion you know and you'll look back very glad <unk> truly the damage generation though 'cause like each day she learn something new and now my mom has pretty much so limited and it's so hard to see this but i can see the joy she brings her so that makes me feel heavy but <unk> really hard to see one person that you love so much check out and then you know starting to learn how to love this other one that gosh i have such a responsibility now how's your husband adjusting to owe him this you know how men are their lives don't change all that much <unk> it'll doing his volunteer firefighter thing and he's having a lot of carbon monoxide alarm's going off <unk> oh he's making all kinds of extra runs and he's all happy about that but [noise] and of course he has all the relatives here in town so there's that all the things going on but um i think okay and that he um is you know catholic and a lot more schedule than i am i more inner denominational and [laughter] i don't remember all these special days i mean he goes ensures all the time now this let's see what was it on friday it was something and i thought oh you gotta be kidding me starting already you know it's terrible i i do i'm catholic but for god and it was december eighth is something special for me and my mother in law she never <unk> forgot i keep thinking to use the eldest son so someday we're going to be responsible for all the graves blankets and i know this is long distance but sometimes you got to tell me tell you my grave blanket story but i mean there is so cute he he buys all these graves blankets you know for all the different relatives that are here and then he takes them all around well then the whoever the cemetery official says oh you can't do that yet it's not you know officially the time and it was in the catholic weekly or something well mister correctly you know this is the guy that was the nazis for eleven months healing what do you mean i can't put my son and i could put a prisoner of war yeah yeah and he said the thing that gave him home a little too but you can stick back in your mind when i remember him telling you doesn't talk a lot about it but he said that when they brought in one of the other americans uh he had sixty six little ban it pokes over his head so then <unk> and the other prisoners knew the nazi's were never going to kill 'em they were just gonna make 'em feel uncomfortable sure yes well the guy made it so he said that the human <unk> look <unk> slipped children's television network seat and it says loud as i can see an colleen [laughter] she loves the show and i this guy's she kinda got one of those funny voices you know i think i hope this is really positive for childhood said he certainly is no captain kangaroo you know <unk> don't even have dinosaurs and you know well my grandchildren went through the barney phase will the too old i have three grandchildren uh-huh and uh after a time i couldn't stand to see anything purple that <unk> thought oh well i got her <unk> christmas and a little baby by you know it's a phase goes through and then <unk> it's kinda cute keeps them occupied yeah grow out of it take hide their imagination that there was something else your grandkids in pennsylvania there were no

was with daniel and <unk> he's always like like i said that to jeanie and she was just like well daniel is she's like well she does he does more with the with david now than <unk> than than he then he does daniel now i'm like that's because <unk> older and he's like not around as much because he's out with his friends right unlike he took daniel to disney world <unk> and i'm like yes he did a lot of this stuff because daniel was older but on the other hand he never did anything to compensate for the fact that he was standing doing stuff with daniel you know he never did anything <unk> <unk> david okay you can't take 'em didn't land but it's been a whole day at the park with him exactly and the thing is the one nice thing about carol is i think she totally recognize that like when daniel went to disneyland with eugene because you had to go to a conference stomach <unk> david <unk> david was too little to like sit quietly for the day right a conference so carol took <unk> david dutch wonderland which is like you know for <unk> little kids right and i'm like you gene should've done that you know <unk> should have come back and taken david dutch wonderland right and like it's always been obvious and david hits yeah eugene all the time and it's always like kind of mean too and <unk> and you just kind of wines and goes to and my dad 'cause you know that's <unk> he sounds exactly the way he did when i used to it um we were little kids really handy because he does he doesn't have anything <unk> spain and it's like his father [noise] so i just poor david i feel so bad for him he's such a nice cat he's really bright and he's just like i think the reason that like <unk> see i try to tell stuff to jeannie cause i'm hoping that she might catch on and try and do something in the situation right my mom's like you can't be managing it's not <unk> i'm like i know but she's <unk> she's closer to the situation <unk> anybody else and maybe she could do something right and it's like i said the genie i think david it's really affected badly by what goes on between his parents more than daniel is because david really a lot more sensitive than daniel is and she goes <unk> was becoming a very sensitive young man and blah blah blah <unk> talking about like sensitive like i'm a sensitive guy right i'm talking about david isn't very sensitive to like his parents emotions and it really like he he notices them or and cares about them a lot more <unk> it's not like you're you're trying to say that daniels in insensitive three [laughter] i know i mean he's fourteen [noise] ah what to do it you know what i mean and i'm just like okay <unk> like you're <unk> <unk> sometimes i mean what i mean i'm just like the poor poor david like see daniel always had a real sense of humor about his mother's <unk> yeah like even like i remember once at um we went over there for hanukkah and we're like standing around waiting and waiting for dinner waiting for dinner waiting for dinner and daniel was just like a daniel was like six years old and he just like the more <unk> it's going to be a while we i i don't know what <unk> you know and like you know i got i didn't say <unk> yeah and but david has really sensitive like he totally prize or protect his mother <unk> feelings he totally like tries to watch out for her last like she's been very attentive to him yeah so he's going to going on her and that's just the way it is but it's like it's such like and so he's totally <unk> her craziness when she says crazy things to him he totally just like damn he listens to what she does because he's so worried about her feelings getting her which i mean i'm sure she likes huge guilt trips on them yeah it's just a shame this is a bad team so i don't know i sort of feel like they should have just picked one parent you know <unk> well yeah i mean [noise] they're pros and cons to both ways but in that case i mean i think they need a stronger father to be honest yeah anything <unk> kind of hard to change personality yeah but <unk> changed subjects i guess my brother staying at u._s._c. oh yes yeah what brought all this well i don't i can't remember i told you this or not because you're thinking about leaving right i know that <unk> think talking about dropping out of school together with our race car driver oh no i didn't hear that was a race car driving like school now [laughter] anyway [laughter] [noise] well i mean okay this is how i feel if he wants to be raised <unk> that's great [laughter] neither fall back plant you know i mean good idea to go somewhere and get your <unk> [laughter] that's a good idea to have that bachelors but if you you don't want to u._b._a. transferred back to iowa get it there where it's a hell of a lot cheaper looking into like spending summer's on the research <unk> right is he doing that no you know he he was talking about well i don't really know what i want to do and isn't that you know and he's still interested in photography i'm like i went and got him <unk> you know names and emails that people <unk> contact people who are individual people who are now photographers who are perfectly willing to like talk to him <unk> and to be honest with you i don't think <unk> ever contact with them <unk> you know it's like hello it's kinda hard to feel sorry for all the time that you feel like you're not going anywhere 'cause you're not doing anything for yourself right so a b. he said he wants to u._s._c. uh-huh the big problem with that with it i've got a job right they tell you that yeah you did okay <unk> he loves his new job cool loves his new job the happiest i've heard him about a job in a long time well that's good yeah i really love his new job actually had thanksgiving and the day after off [noise] oh nice very nice [laughter] so we did that and he has a little spa like oh hot tub worley bubbly jet spot thing <unk> <unk> like sitting there night and like during champagne [laughter] whoa [laughter] i could dig that anyway <unk> the <unk> the which means that since he's been working there there's no more u._s._c. sponsored tuition remission right which means there's an extra like some ten thousand or something dollar gap every year right that somebody has to come up with the fun [laughter] you know like <unk> not really having a hard to hurt with that you know <unk> just sort of expect that <unk> the money part of that field by mom who didn't you know assumes that that <unk> wants to do and and so [laughter] you know <unk> assumed that will give him whatever she gave me for college right well i mean i actually disgusted with my father funding you worked with you work on your dad i mean i remember you working on your dad even senior year you're like i had only get some money right and but i like i i put time into the relationship right <unk> i would call him i would write 'em letters and know what i was doing my butt off you know <unk> every summer all through school you know right and all the money head that i could contribute i contributed right in fact i have a steady job and he does work during the summer but i don't think he's necessarily saving money from the summer for school <unk> and you like they had another settlement with my dad <unk> any use that money to buy a car [laughter] like a few years ago <unk> okay like right before we went to college and it's like okay let's see let's look at our priorities here really you know and he liked doesn't yeah sex there's like a lot of family members that are getting really fed up with my brother really and i really can't blame them <unk> and he's always been very obnoxious but he's just beginning to be more and more of a selfish brag and going over the line i mean the thing is he's he's mature and the last year <unk> sell the long way to go [noise] he's just like it seems everything's going to be handed to him and like nothing's his fault and you know you need to take no responsibility <unk> anything right and people are like hello you almost twenty you should be able to clean up your message your mother should not have to go up behind you right <unk> and she does he's like this little prodigal son or something first strange when i was in i'm in chicago <unk> couple of weekends ago oh cool for um well i had an interview northwestern you told me about <unk> and i think i'm pretty well <unk> was very impressed with the school it's very expensive [noise] well my sister is applying to north western <unk> chicago probably maybe it'll be in <unk> in med school the same city my sister's in college chicago's like such a great town yeah she liked it i mean really great place to be um she definitely wants to be in a city yeah well i mean northwestern undergrad actually in evanston which is a suburb but yeah it's real <unk> like it's hard to get to chicago from there [laughter] she looked at both 'cause my dad one of his former students teaches at north western and so abby went up like spring break last year and stayed with the <unk> the school and went and looked at north western <unk> chicago and looked around chicago and hung out so she had <unk> mean neighborhood wise had <unk> haven't seen chicago any day really i mean you chicago's really bad really yeah i mean i have friends who went there but i don't know it's like <unk> chicago's like more serious academically i think it has a reputation for being so anyway yeah so i don't know <unk> you know what i mean can be real stress cooker yeah school yeah i don't know <unk> into that are not well she's not affected by that she wouldn't be affected by like other people's stressing out like <unk> it's not just <unk> <unk> mean northwestern not a good school so i had a huge talk one night <unk> mom's friend kathy stay with her one of her friends from college uh-huh and i just like we were up at four thirty in the morning wow i'm did not know we're a belly huge talk about like my mom and my dad and like oh it's very eye opening you get older and older you talk to your parents friend i don't know if you do but i do uh-huh because there's a lot i don't know uh-huh wow like so many things start to makes sense yeah oh so that's why they [laughter] that way <unk> well that's good so i mean it's good in that sense but on the other hand <unk> takes the mystique out of your parents i mean that was the last a long time ago [laughter] they were very humid early on but it it kind of explains <unk> i don't really remember them ever being together right you know and i remember them some fightings it's like well i wonder if they're ever loved each other <unk> yeah how old are they get married [laughter] i mean i've got <unk> because i'm here but [noise] so i don't know it's it's been so that was kinda interesting uh-huh like talking it's always interesting here especially people that you always assume are like <unk> allies with your mother uh-huh and to hear that they actually understand your father's point of view or you're like wow okay [laughter] you know it was it was a good trip like multiple levels yeah but hopefully i should hear from north western like the end of january cool have you heard from washington yet or a letter saying this competitive category like just rang people like thank you [laughter] in the agony [laughter] oh you're competitive but we're not going <unk> got him yet yeah well thanks because like i would think most people are okay [laughter] what does that mean eighteen <unk> doesn't mean shaq it means will talk to you later [laughter] taking means they didn't outright reject me [laughter] well good luck <unk> got into two <unk> mean as in state off the wedding last <unk> yeah and i think that you are just a little bit stronger catty um when i'm brands fraternity brothers oh and he like basically got like three weeks here now it's cool yeah he's he's from wash and he's from seattle so but he he apparently got like like <unk> really <unk> like <unk> seven or something his freshman year thing yeah [laughter] and although he did better and his subsequent years not you know i mean that really sucks up your whole yeah g._p._a. not just g._p._a. but transcript in general yeah and so um yeah he had trouble getting into med school and so he um but he finally like 'cause he didn't even get into you know the first time the applied mhm <unk> <unk> when you getting a state school you kind of have a problem yeah and so he um he took a took

wouldn't have had <unk> i would have just like been stranded in the middle of berkley with no place to go i mean you know that would have been really terror with all my suitcases there <unk> i would have been out in front of seder and no one would have been there mhm for two days mhm i wouldn't have known what was going on [laughter] i just see you camping on the lawns you actually that's would

i just sold back a few books uh-huh and made about eighty dollars good so that's good that's good so all right well okay <unk> <unk> that's okay we'll just have to take you know one instead of tell you what instead of you guys coming down here for one of those times just consider that the fact that i'm changing my time twice that one time well let's not anyway yeah i know but let's not worry about that right now i feel bad but i just feel like <unk> there's nothing i could have done [noise] i know well you know what i'll just go ahead and change it um will tell dad first <unk> well i

room <unk> yet <unk> huh i check out tomorrow morning so what are you going to do if you're i mean do you have stuff to stay on your bed and everything <unk> shiites and what'd you do with i mean i have my comfort her here oh okay so what i'll do is probably leave it in the dorm and then come back and get next semester from europe so oh you're probably she let she's got a lot to keep a few things here uh-huh so i'll just i i'm leaving my comfort i'm leaving <unk> food items that i just couldn't take uh-huh so um [noise] and so did may help you move yeah a little bit she helped me with my computer uh-huh that's hard <unk> yeah that was the main thing because if i would have had to uh the other stuff i had to put into huge garbage bags <unk> most of it was garbage bags mhm i just threw everything into garbage bag and and put 'em on this big like read a cart <unk> someone i i had to we'll all the way the state of which took so long <unk> up a hill it was so exhausted oh boy so i would have had to have my ah computers on the cart <unk> good because i could it's like well a little bit of often they could've fallen off they could've fallen off definitely like to have computers bumped around <unk> so may basically <unk> drove me oh that's great yeah and she helped me carry them in so how many trips did you have to make back and forth <unk> altogether three uh-huh i bet you were tired oh i'm still tired i haven't like i'm <unk> tired <unk> not even completely what moving is hard yeah i know really helped me other than that i mean like near josh just sat there necking when i was in the middle packing [laughter] so where am i am so glad i'm leaving them oh it's not very fun to be around somebody who's there is so weird mom it's like they're not normal people like how long story well we've got time oh good point okay [laughter] well it's like mira doesn't really care that much about other people it's like she seems to be nice but it's like she i don't know it's really hard to describe but she's kind of superficially nice but she's not really thoughtful and she can sell it to me it anyway she's not it's just almost like she's nice and it's just so blah say about things she doesn't care at all mhm about anything like about how people feel and oh for example this is one thing <unk> <unk> it's been really automated nerves lately i don't know if i told you about this was that josh it basically it's like living in the room the only thing he doesn't do it here asleep and that doesn't matter <unk> when i'm sleeping i don't care if he's in their line uh-huh you know what i mean uh-huh but uh she doesn't sleep everybody spends all of his time here mhm so you don't have any privacy at all i had to ask him to leave so why don't you <unk> and or go somewhere else to change uh-huh we're pretty ridiculous yeah so the thing is i'm basically a would've frustrating thing so basically josh like likes to play this game called mech warrior mhm which is this really stupid video game and it's on your computer and him and all the other guys on the on the floor like love playing this game uh-huh so they all come out <unk> right and they all <unk> and they do at the stupidest thing they do you think that is really inconsiderate actually that's the latest they've done it sometimes to twelve sometimes it's two one <unk> but it's it's like <unk> week and they they were doing it at one o'clock in the morning <unk> next day [noise] [noise] well you know that's really really inconsiderate and i'll <unk> i'll tell you the truth that's one of the reasons that i don't like coed dorms and it's not that i have anything against you know guys and girls being on the same floor but i think that it's so much more unruly and um you know all of these things that you're experiencing i just think i don't think it enhances the experience i think it really you know makes it more stressful well guess what tiresome experience i'm not going to be in a coed dorm <unk> i know i'm going to be a single sex dorm i know in one way you know what did i mean did you have some pleasurable experiences <unk> sure i had a couple of [laughter] some random pleasurable experiences <unk> did you make some people some friends with people that you'd like to maintain yeah yeah like one girl i tried to get it get to join theta her name summer <unk> told you about her yeah you did but yeah <unk> she's really sweet uh-huh and i liked it a lot [noise] well this year to keep in touch with her <unk> have her number and everything mhm oh yeah i mean it's not like you're far you can come and <unk> it's five minutes walk so not a big problem <unk> like you know you can ever come visit you honestly though i really don't think i like the people here enough to really want to maintain a friendship with which is really it's really a shame it is considering i mean i made friends with joy so quickly and <unk> and i've been here a whole semester and there's no one i'm really close to mhm and i've tried mhm people aren't really it's really strange [noise] well you know sometimes you mix with a group and sometimes you just don't but i guess but you know <unk> i mean i've i've made more friends with people said that <unk> well that's my point <unk> obviously you know you and theta chose each other because you have a lot in common yeah and you know that's what's so nice about it as you feel kinda simpatico with them and um you know there's there's a a meshing there's chemistry i really liked them <unk> <unk> i mean not all of them are friendly but it's you know it's a huge house oh of course so yeah it's really cool so i think that um aren't you glad that you made the decision to change <unk> i really am i really especially for the last several weeks have been really miserable mhm really well i'm sorry you've been so miserable but boy it sure reinforces your decision doesn't it yeah seriously mhm so i'm really glad you guys convinced me move so how has mira been to toward you will surprise she hasn't she doesn't care she really does not care when i told her she just didn't say anything <unk> weird she's like she just doesn't care about anything like <unk> but not in a depressed way uh-huh liking it totally i'm <unk> i just really couldn't care but i'm thrilled with whatever's happening whatever <unk> like she's happy <unk> she doesn't care was she <unk> happy for you i mean did she say i'm happy for you i guess but i mean basically the thing it's like she doesn't get mad and she doesn't get she doesn't get ecstatic uh-huh so she's just so neutral yeah mhm <unk> doesn't get <unk> i've never seen her agree mhm ever literally she doesn't she doesn't frau she doesn't cry <unk> yell uh-huh literally so she's just really in the middle all the time yeah it's really strange well it's kind of frustrating because then you don't really get to feel like they're a real person right i i don't know she's just [noise] it's like we've lived together for an entire semester and i feel like i'm <unk> little bit but she hasn't really let me know her uh-huh it's like she just doesn't care that much <unk> doesn't really have any really close girlfriends here uh-huh then again i guess i don't either but i have close ones that she does like all she hangs out with his josh and the guys on the floor <unk> and then lately <unk> but you know uh-huh well you know you so you can't pick your roommates so yeah the best you could but i'm leaving though what i'm <unk> oh i know well just think about how happy <unk> be coming back yeah you'll be really pleased in thrilled you're right about that how many girls are moving in second semester ah d._c. for about seven eight so i'm about a third of the girls that a lot that is a lot that maybe it means that there's going to be that they're so happy with <unk> that they can't wait to be there i think that's true <unk> must be it <unk> in my case so it's also that i just didn't like where it was but i'll see i'd like faded to want to move anyway mhm so so um what'd you do with all your stuff well there's a store german theta and i just basically had house house mother open the store room and i put all my stuff in there so they lock it yeah it's all safe another <unk> fact she was really protective she wouldn't even let me leave it open for like five minutes oh really yeah oh that's really nice yeah so she's real careful yeah is this an older woman she's very old she's sort of a little senile yeah yeah what's her name <unk> uh-huh but she's okay she's temporary sort of what other house lady was like psychotic oh no [laughter] they're really old well i guess we have to wonder who's going to be a house mother yeah you know somebody who's real busier has a a life isn't really going to want to know that <unk> probably a widower you know someone someone who doesn't have much of a life is she an ex data i don't think so it's not a requirement <unk> it'd be nice but is requirement usually there i'm reasonably experienced in the art of you know being <unk> her mothers or whatever you call it helps mother's usually it's like a job and they've done it before that experience ah well that's great that is great i remember i mean i haven't thought about this since i was in scripts but i remember the um the dorm other that we had there really she was an older lady too real sweet <unk> yeah i don't really like it was just <unk> quite that much but that's okay i don't have <unk> <unk> well i i don't remember anybody necessarily going and you know talking to her for advice and stuff like that <unk> know you know <unk> don't go to her for advice she's not the type of person uh-huh and i don't think we're quite that desperate [laughter] um but it's good to have an adult they're just in case you know [laughter] yeah [noise] so anyway <unk> dad that lately um he's been really busy alone telling me that he's been like really sort of nasty tour well yeah she has not had a good experience within the last thing going on um well you know how when you're an adolescent how you're really into yourself well what do you consider mean adolescent know but when you were in high school you were more that way you don't get me and i love not really real i mean you're kind of like the <unk> the old teenager no oh [laughter] so [laughter] i'm like i mean you still are in adolescence but <unk> but you know you're not like in the middle of adolescence anymore once you get out of high school and and um you've had all these maturing experiences right had sex and stuff like that i beg your pardon groups i didn't see that it's <unk> i'm just getting more who did the dirty did ma [laughter] i'm just thinking that this is being recorded grades initiative recorded that conversation <unk> the other day which <unk> which was the one with the my god that would have been embarrassing [laughter] is that guy ever going to speak to you again <unk> i don't think he cared distracted okay but couldn't sky but what this is like totally off the subject what describe what borderline personality is why because i'm curious what else well remember mhm it's really kind of complicated um well i my challenging or mental abilities or something no yeah sure [laughter] it's kinda complicated <unk> maybe it's it you think your child your mind mental abilities to [laughter] i just really talented i memory is what you're challenging sure yeah <unk> <unk> you don't have <unk> you've never cheated any um i'm sure that i have [laughter] okay sure they have 'em but i didn't really understand borderline personality until more recently really you learn about that in social work no mhm okay [noise] um how do you know said if you don't understand it well i've got a good diagnostic manual and i've read books on it really mhm cool so tell me about it okay i'm a borderline unless you don't want to do you know i can tell you're just a little bit i just interested okay a borderline personality is um a person who can go um potentially in and out of ah states of normalcy into you know sort of like unreality times right um and their their ego is more fragile and there you know ability to um kind of keep a hold of reality is more fragile and i'm i'm just trying to think of of um what i can describe i don't i don't really know what that well to be able to say that much about it but um they're actually it's it's not an easy i've known allergy disorder to treat or to diagnose [noise] no i don't think it's no i mean when you look at the diagnostic um description is probably not that hard to diagnose um but i've known people who were borderline personality that you know when you first know them i mean they can appear to be completely normal but went after you've known them for a period of time right and you look back then you can you can see the um the abnormalities allot <unk> just like give me an example of a person what they say to make themselves be borderline or whatever [noise] well um you've known to people actually write i've known julie <unk> and that's what <unk> well okay oh three people now three people okay smith and corey really mhm are you sure absolutely i mean like that's sort of a little ironic that both of our old people in our lives are <unk> [noise] yeah well and and they're very different people but you can see how you know they appear tiered they appear to be really normal you know what i'm saying right you wouldn't really know but um when you look back i mean it was more evident with i'm corey um in terms of i mean this is isn't something that you would have seen but i i don't i mean i don't remember either really know i know it was sort of a while ago yeah but she she had i she actually had um i think semi psychotic episodes <unk> which one <unk> okay um and smith um distorted reality so much oh yeah that's for sure that i'm sure that <unk> you know in ways that you and i could look and know that it was a complete and total distortion but see like <unk> did you ever look crazy to me what i was talking with you know i know i know that's the point she doesn't look crazy at all and and and borderline isn't crazy well let's see when i get julie <unk> and dad said that she's borderline i know he doesn't like <unk> but it's like she's different though it's like she doesn't react like that she's more obviously well also you know i don't remember enough about her want me to tell you okay it's subject you want to talk about no that's okay okay just making sure isn't he'd rather talk about i don't care what we talk about is fine okay uh basically uh [noise] it's really awesome and just it's like has problems with reality but in a different way it's like <unk> it's like a hyper naive <unk> <unk> that makes any sense <unk> it's like she extremely nice mhm but it's not it's like more than that [noise] well it's that's the that's kind of um you know the problem with reality testing you know she doesn't have a real you don't make <unk> example i remember i'll tell you again okay shrimp time mhm uh let's see well like when <unk> when did you know what <unk> was <unk> i just thought it was bizarre mhm really bizarre she's from his country she's completely american mhm it's only she's from another country in another culture mhm she did not know when <unk> was mhm she didn't know pretty weird yeah isn't mhm you mean by that well it it's uh what i didn't hear you i said do you mean mhm i said it's not like some normal food or sorry it's not like some exotic food right that's what i'm <unk> <unk> normal food <unk> it's not like as cargo and maybe she didn't know that that was <unk> or something like she's on culture she just <unk> just didn't know mhm and like when i tried though so abnormally sheltered um but that's that's weird though <unk> yeah but you know there was <unk> <unk> i know i don't know that that's the um but that's <unk> it's more than that i know that's not the probably the <unk> the clearest example i think i'm just her she was the one who didn't know about jumper cables and batteries yeah uh-huh i mean there's there's so much that as a as a normal person she should've been i'm exposed to write you know more than that though sometimes she just gets really is it ten so called her face like but it's like blank [laughter] it's just really weird mhm and i think there's something wrong with <unk> just don't know if it's borderline are not well it could be i you know dad had um maybe more of a grip on on what it is than i do but um you know there's <unk> things that you and i would would process in one way someone with a borderline personality would process it in a completely different way right that would do the average person seem really abnormal that's that's the way <unk> <unk> it's like sometimes she takes things <unk> changes <unk> pure different than they are mhm maybe that's it well because they process them differently uh-huh so you know and it's real it's hard to be in a relationship with um a borderline personality yeah no kidding <unk> anyway [noise] actually i have sort of another topic to discuss it within um number one <unk> his dad been yelling at you or something maybe why because you censor down i know that yeah it wasn't a good day really <unk> what happened well i'll tell you but i'm actually it's been it's been fine for the last couple of weeks that room no oh could i know like your hedging the <unk> the preference has been so really positive and um you know i've been working really hard helping him with the business and [noise] ah doing really quite a lot of stuff um and this this morning um he had these two people come over who are i'm gonna who's gonna hire right and yesterday i had painstakingly prepare their employment agreements there <unk> actually three employment agreements two <unk> three came today and i had you know put them together to copies and i'd clip them together and i are labeled each one of them and you know the little yellow sticky thing right and giving him to dad and um today when they came um and dad came upstairs i was on the telephone or whatever i was doing at the computer and he went to look for the employment agreements any could only find two of the three and so one of the people who was here he couldn't find <unk> and so he was understandably you know irritated and and irritable and and um because he's used to assuming that i don't put things away properly right you know that kind of thing so he snapped me right and i was um kind of defensive because i knew that i had given him all three i mean i knew i had given him all three <unk> because i like i said very painstakingly prepare them and um so i now back down and was probably defensive and he was really mad um that i responded that way and i'm <unk> i was completely inappropriate and you know <unk> when you're just on yourself well what are the <unk> i mean it it's true that maybe i shouldn't have been irritable with him and you know i probably could have handled it differently and i did feel defensive because you know it's it's one thing when i know i've done something wrong but i knew i absolutely didn't and i just didn't want to be accused of doing something wrong when i hadn't <unk> right i you know kind of snap back and um i think he was you know mad because the the guys were downstairs and i think he was concerned that maybe they overheard and um although i'm absolutely sure they didn't um and he just felt that you know if if if this were a business situation and i were his secretary that i never would have smoking him like that oh brother you're not a secretarial i know i'm not <unk> secretary but you know then so he just really was kinda on the warpath with me all day he ever find did well he just printed out a new one on the computer and you know i don't know if you've ever found it or if he did he probably wouldn't even admitted to i know i don't think so but um anyway it was you know it was such a to me it was not a big thing i mean it was it's true that you know i mean he shouldn't have snapped at me and i shouldn't <unk> him um but i just couldn't believe you know how sometimes you get really mad about small thing yeah i mean like a really small but no but i mean it's it's true that i mean you could just generated in two minutes on the computer again so it's not like it was really have <unk> if you're right um anyway but i don't know why he was so upset about it all day but i think that he was stressed about some other things in relation to the business and i think is it going badly no no it's just that um some of the numbers that one person initially said came back ah he he came back and said different numbers today and that really <unk> you know i'm <unk> in other words they went down yeah just in terms of numbers of sales i mean it's just in terms of production it's not in terms of actual know of course yeah alright yet anyway i'm sort of course out custom off well it made him <unk> and and probably concern and i you know my feeling that when he gets i'm stressed about other things that um he makes everything else <unk> get <unk> you react stronger to little things that happen right and um so anyway that's what i think happened okay and so yeah i you know and then when i came home you with gallon yummy oh god and um i thought it was like all over and i was surprised that he was still gallon well couldn't it maybe it was something else so maybe it would do i know so i said well what's the matter and and so 'cause i thought maybe it must've been something new you know [laughter] like oh now what'd i do yeah and ah so you know you just gave me this real scales that you don't know oh god so anyway [noise] and now he's fine but you know i'm still kind of yeah that's the problem with him being in business mom it's completely insecure and when <unk> psychology <unk> everything was always i mean up until that <unk> <unk> everything was completely normal and we'll see <unk> this business is gonna be blockbuster dynamite but mom <unk> that's that's the problem i don't know it's gonna be blockbuster i work i think i think that more than anything he's ever done before the consensus is among the the various people that are working with <unk> that this is uh you know a win win win situation yeah but you know what i mean i don't i don't sound that for me to have out but it's like a lot of these other business ideas who'd been the same thing <unk> you know <unk> supposedly oh it's incredible well this is definitely to work like like a auto accident <unk> uh l. o. c. thing <unk> you know limited liability company that was going to be a huge business well here the truth of the matter is you know he and i know how we really felt about the possibility of the other various businesses working you didn't feel that well well let me put it this way we felt far less certain even though you know anytime you go into a business you think it's going to work because you wouldn't risk it if you didn't have the belief that it was going to work course but you know like for instance automatically probably felt was um well i'm sure you was going to work at eight eighty twenty you know <unk> the thing is that's almost even worse certain because at that point you actually had an office you had to work and credit cards you had <unk> we had fun we had you know <unk> investors and funding from the bank you know in terms that was more than twenty well that was almost ninety ten well not really because you still have to make the business work well right um but anyway i think that this is you know as much if not more likelihood where's the <unk> the things never was that strong and even the very excited about that that's what i don't know well of course you're if you're starting something new well yeah but we never had the same level of confirmation from other sources or belief right you know that that that one or the very top would work i i felt a lot less your about the very top because [noise] um the sail was had to be such a huge sale you know between four hundred thousand in a million dollars per sale that he's doing those huge figure well it was completely unrealistic to me see that's what i think i think it was overpriced and um i didn't you know i mean that's what it's like <unk> you get <unk> she throws around because it's like he always

<unk> said you know same company and everything <unk> that i'm going <unk> to work in dispatch and there's <unk> um well actually what i'm going to be doing <unk> where um i have to schedule people who need emergency calls or whatever onto um whatever technicians available at the time you <unk> i don't know they say it's stressful because i'm a lot yeah and <unk> take it because like nine one one mhm <unk> yeah so they they say that a lot of people won't take it and stuff things like that but i'd probably doing did you get you out on the phone <unk> <unk> yeah yeah <unk> you know if you're in a if if one of the appliances breaking with <unk> <unk> <unk> you know you <unk> been people you know <unk> said that you're <unk> 'cause i pay money <unk> well no actually i would be getting it from the technicians not from the customers yeah some customers i would because i would have to call them <unk> if i can't scheduled them for a call and i would have to be the one to call him and tell him okay i'm sorry not tonight <unk> tomorrow yeah but i'm actually how we get shoot out by the technicians <unk> <unk> i would be doing add on to them oh and you know some technicians maybe they've already been allentown causing made seven o'clock at night already and they've already been out there <unk> send the clock in the morning and then you're telling them to go yeah <unk> exactly oh i see mhm so i may be chewed up by them not by the customers are per se <unk> even though you know <unk> so how do you pick these people then what are what he's technicians well i i haven't really started training yet but i'm gonna start training next week yeah and um i think they have a system where you know they would look at the technicians and exactly what the customer requested <unk> area they're in and and you have to find out what technicians working that area <unk> on so forth [noise] oh well if you're going to transfer <unk> wouldn't <unk> would that make it a lot more difficult for you to come up here and work your yeah [laughter] really well okay well first <unk> this is what i found out first of all there's no openings over there uh-huh right now <unk> only openings they have is for telemarketing that's it uh-huh northern open and telemarketers get paid less telemarketers get paid more uh-huh but i've already done that for a whole year and i don't really like it was you're going to get paid more and stuff you know well i mean it's <unk> it's from the <unk> again now it'd probably be a dollar more mhm <unk> our yeah that <unk> look <unk> yeah but i don't like it i mean i see okay think about it the assets i get from working in dispatch customer service and tele marketer if i ever find a new job <unk> i'm going to be better prepared than anybody who's ever been a telemarketer for two years three years or whatever uh-huh i've had this that i've had a you know i've had um like your of um clerical and i've had a your telemarketing okay granted well maybe easier for you to find a job <unk> you may be harder for you to find a a well paying job because usually well paying jobs demand specialization <unk> few <unk> years then yeah like <unk> like let's say you like that i mean let's let's take mcdonalds as as a point but then you had you know when you experience flipping burgers when your experience using ah you know <unk> right and when you experience as a cashier okay and <unk> and of course if you go out to the job market you can probably find a job quick you know because you you know specialize let's say that there was a cashiers jobs that are you know a was paying a lot more but then they wanted a lotta people was was you know more experience <unk> yeah yeah well i i very much <unk> you can really compare mutual a person that works at mcdonalds you know <unk> <unk> <unk> in different fields yes i know now donald right though when you <unk> trying to find another job right um do you understand that it does the let's say let's say that it's ah you know it's <unk> okay <unk> you know and then you know you know one cashier in job one job and <unk> you know like the the name was really not okay when my when <unk> your experience <unk> well that's what i mean i mean specialization if if i have a specialization in three areas <unk> compared to one you know i have you call a specialized only been there one years old but you see three years all three <unk> all three of them i have dealt with customer service <unk> and the fact that the fact that i've been able to to um i've been very productive <unk> in those two areas so far <unk> telemarketing i was very good at <unk> i was always above a hundred percent so and so forth clerical i'm above my expectation to oh i see okay so the fact that i'm able to change over from one area to another learn to adapt and do so well the i think that's a very good point in my area <unk> okay and if i transfer over dispatch which is which is a very high stress environment and if i'm able to do that and convert so easily and and be able to do to do well as far as productivity and getting people to cooperate with me i mean that's far more experienced than anything else that i could have i can imagine as far as telemarketing ever you know <unk> ice skate two or three years and telemarketing you know compared to be able to change from one place to another and <unk> and everything i think that's more important <unk> you understand <unk> if you take <unk> if you don't take and telemarketing job and you will be will you come up here yeah probably yeah yeah well you're going to take it anyway what the <unk> <unk> uh-huh i i requested it as heck i'm i'm kind of i i really don't like [laughter] my clerical job because um the people i'm around <unk> um too many people i mean really <unk> the supervisors there <unk> we have we have one main supervisor into assistant supervisor's a well when the main supervisor is isn't there and the two assistance we're visors they're doing whatever they they fool around they don't do a good job and i've already i've already went to the head person about this <unk> and everything and they got to talk to and they were good for a while and then bam it's again you know same thing you see so much favoritism going on but finally because you know what every single day i always work late later than i'm supposed to be okay like nine o'clock when i'm ready to go whatever <unk> <unk> i always end up spending maybe ten fifteen minutes after nine o'clock no overtime yes i do get overtime but if i stayed six minutes <unk> overtime <unk> i do not get paid for that six minutes <unk> and during the six <unk> <unk> and there had been plenty of times i've sat there and i've had it you know hurrying rational and blah blah blah things like that just because you know they don't want to being overtime or whatever but nine <unk> nine o'clock strikes i should be able to get out just like everybody else 'cause i'm not getting paid for those extra minutes <unk> time there and then you you said you were only only seven minutes and after okay yeah and the thing is i don't goof around or anything you know it's not like <unk> nine o'clock strikes and them you know i'm sitting there spending five minutes getting ready nothing like that you know <unk> those miss er after nine o'clock i spend working <unk> you know and that's what gets me really mad and i've done this for very long time <unk> everybody else in clerical don't don't do that because everybody just leave <unk> <unk> you know and they don't get <unk> talk to nothing you know i'm always stuck getting the lake and then not just that but i'm also the assistance i mean finally on uh just last saturday and i mean i was just so mad because they schedule me by myself so from eight three to five thirty <unk> everybody left at five o'clock side half an hour by myself <unk> we're <unk> find the whole entire day but finally when when those two other critical people left i was by myself and a half hour okay fifteen minutes before five thirty i was with a whole bunch of sales the phones were ringing people were coming up to me asking me questions <unk> this assistant supervisors didn't nothing <unk> staying there 'til six o'clock when after five thirty they started <unk> was and i was getting close to six o'clock but they didn't help me <unk> i mean that is their job <unk> you know i mean if you know if they see me falling behind wherever they don't it's not their job just you know be behind mean and brag about how late it is and blah blah blah 'cause i'm sitting there working <unk> i'm i'm wasn't taking my my suite time i'm very i'm very fast you know and it just got me so mad you know that that that they're you know they're just [noise] gosh you know it really got me nuts i just ask for transfer <unk> you know i'm finally there's um so there was this opening and and i talk to them and they said fine i mean i had i had a supervisor put in a good word for me and you know and i think that got me the that we get paid more <unk> no i actually <unk> i think i'd get <unk> the same pay mhm but um for for more stress the different environment <unk> more stress well you see it might not be more stressed me mhm i mean what was stressing me out was the environment i was in in that i mean that was everything <unk> <unk> i mean i we read a little bit about it and some <unk> well see i mean you know if it's more stressful than i put myself in that situation but if it's not and if i can handle it you know hey that's that's fine i mean i can always you know learn to deal with work work isn't really what scares me it's it's the the work environment that i meant <unk> you know <unk> you like <unk> you know it's like all the <unk> the ethics around my workplace <unk> i'm saying i don't understand it's like it's an awesome time for you to come up no because all these people <unk> please use the <unk> the job <unk> wouldn't department transferred up your chances are you probably won't get stuck with the with the same people that is true but you know what i heard i heard that people over there are even worse <unk> i'm <unk> and all that stuff you know because the the supervisor that transferred over there <unk> told me that uh-huh and um she was telling me how hard it was the very beginning because the people there aren't used to discipline and they aren't used to really working they they okay the reason they have this the supervisor transfer over there because the supervisor is known to be very very strict uh-huh okay <unk> very very very strict and they want her to go over there to get the place together you know and it's i mean the people there are just from what i hear from her and she's and she's really i'm not a person to be done it or anything but when she went over there she told me it was really bad i mean people do whatever they want <unk> hardly anybody there knew what they were supposed to do i mean no one you the system nothing and things like that and she had her <unk> people and and regroup people and and and she says she still hadn't problems now as it is you know that there's a lotta people there who worked there for very long time and used to that environment you already used to the fact that they could do whatever they want blah blah blah and things like that and you know me i'm very i'm very buy the book person uh-huh and um since working in clerical i've seen so much stuff that's been going around and there have been people there who works for very long time and i you know i finally got set up and i told the boss you know certain things that they were going on and so and so forth and you know i i've earned a lot of i've actually probably made quite a bit of enemies you know but to this point i really don't care if i make enemies you know it's like i just as long as i'm doing my job but they make my work really hard for me well they have seniority so if i didn't call than you along with taking you for you know like what calls <unk> you know yeah i mean you know i had was really hoping for you to come up you know when you see the thing is is that i still don't know if i can or if i can't my supervisor has been on vacation for two weeks now and then <unk> recently she just went on a seminar for a week so i really haven't had a chance to talk to her and i have to go buy her book verification book so once i once i'm able to go and talk to her about it about what about vacation i could schedule it no i'm talking <unk> you coming up you know and <unk> were you

you can get burned out you know and and you probably go back and paula just like <unk> lots of other people but as it is i already am burned out the what's the point <unk> not <unk> you're keeping ongoing you're like staying the same job and stuff you know and you still have <unk> you still care you know what you want to do stuff you know when you don't care enough [noise] [noise] yeah well i'm going to get burned out though okay if if i end up i mean just like when i was going to school working when i'm trying to do right now is do this this this dispatch thing and try it out and i told him that <unk> that <unk> could go back to school probably in the um in the fall of next year and he said that was fine you know i i could actually workout something where i could get very little hours and and go to school and i'd be okay you know i'm planning to go back to school but it's just not right now i just don't want any pressures from anybody telling me what i should do anything because you know i mean seriously to me to me i i will i will walk my own way whether it's the hard way or not i mean yeah yeah people are going to tell me things are going to help me and stuff and i know that they're doing it for my benefit but one thing about me is i always have to learn for myself always you know people could <unk> mean you know and tell me the women and and tell me experiences about their lives and things like that but you know <unk> i've i've lost the ability to be touched by that anymore <unk> it's like you know people kicking me sob stories and i won't feel from anymore <unk> you know things like i mean i used to be able to feel for them i used to be able to take their advice and and use it and utilize it and listen and and try to learn from and blah blah blah i just can't do that anymore okay you know it's just like right now and people tell me things i'll do what i want whether or not it's gonna hurt me or not i'll learn that by myself i right now i'm i'm at the point where i have to learn the hard way <unk> it's it's like kind of like i'm guessing away my way or no way <unk> not exactly to that point yet but getting their <unk> yeah so it's kinda like that you know and and right now you know i mean <unk> you know i know that you mean well and everything you know and i and i really would like to go over there but right now i'm just not ready for that i mean just for me to go over there and change my whole life around <unk> you know whether it be for my best interest or not just the thought i mean just the thought of of just going over there and and feeling ostracized and having to start all over again and i hope with all that <unk> from what well uh you know the word mean yes okay ostracized and we're losing ostracized okay like whenever i see you mommy together uh-huh it's like i guess i i i see that closest there <unk> that i'm able to get and i mean i know that she favors you stuff like that you know and that that to me i'm ostracized from that okay and like i i i'm not there i'm not part of the family ah you know even though i know you gotta try and including me i still feel left out because of the fact that there's that bonding there i don't have <unk> you know watching too many talk shows or something you know i mean i am i feeling like that for a very long time now i know that you know and you know what i'm saying that you know that it was an awesome <unk> well like <unk> okay yes i know and i mean probably just mostly you know well well that maybe <unk> mostly me but i'm just telling you my viewpoint you know whether or not it'd be right or not but that is my view <unk> not all <unk> them you know <unk> might be like on a show or walls less exactly left out kicked out ostracized now come on young chick value like employment something active that old i am from how long you know <unk> to make you feel about done that's not true and all <unk> i'm sure it's it's not true but i mean i still feel that way though uh-huh okay and you have to understand that that don't have to you don't okay okay you don't have to understand but but um whether you you you understand or not that is my feeling and that's how i feel and it hurts me you know and then also friends i mean everything there you're already comfortable in and blah blah blah you know this <unk> and i'm just not ready to to go into the <unk> let me tell you this i i don't have that much i'm not that self confident yet <unk> <unk> i can go into an environment be comfortable with okay you know people giving you the attention and and i feel left out i just can't stand right now well i've huh this is like my my construction <unk> you're going to come up you know it's gonna help you out but making decisions for you know and like please you may be trying to find you a good job <unk> you know give you <unk> <unk> money would help you with your place weird yeah you'd be on your own you know like for most of your life would be on your own and then sometimes you <unk> you might have to put up with her when <unk> was <unk> but most of the time you know you you you can you <unk> you don't have to worry about stuff like you know uh the daily news or c._d.s or whatever the lakers are like in terms of like trying to find a place to live in trying to find a place to work you know and you'll hear to come up here and stuff we could i could help you probably find a job that pays you you know me as much more <unk> <unk> <unk> you you would you talk about i don't know not thinking <unk> i mean i talked about that too like <unk> you know when <unk> move family you know you own <unk> thing for you well [laughter] well that's <unk> okay <unk> i i guess you're you're you're still not understand okay you're not understanding me i really don't care about about finding a job or or or finding a place to stay uh-huh i've never really been much worried about that it's not that that i'm worried about uh-huh okay it's it's it's a it's a life that i mean let me put it this way i'm not ready to feel lonely again [laughter] uh-huh okay i mean here i don't really feel <unk> it's like all my life i've always felt left out i've always felt lonely uh-huh i've always i've always just been so alone you know even though i've had people around me and stuff i've just felt so alone <unk> i've never been put in a place where people really needed me or or really <unk> important are just wanting to two two calls just to tell me you know their problems or just called to see how i'm doing yeah church <unk> won't usually <unk> well you know it's not really sincere like you know you don't have much right now <unk> <unk> you know what <unk> no it is now [noise] and then when you know when <unk> saw the other <unk> though don't you <unk> well especially when you have <unk> years yeah i mean yeah but i live with i just don't feel that special bonding with them i mean i really haven't saw especial bonding like in a friendship for very long time i mean with them i mean it's like i know they're very nice people i mean you know really i i i think may has really you know been great as far as you know writing <unk> even though i haven't written her anything and sending me her graduation um invitation everything you know things i mean i'm i'm really touched by that you know i i really am moves not here but no i just don't feel close to her i just don't feel <unk> let me tell you this when we actually spend time together when i was over there we actually argue and hardly talked mhm okay it was like that but when we haven't seen each other and and <unk> were were writing to each other it's fine but you know i i could write to her and everything but meet her don't think like <unk> you know we we write to each other and stuff and and there's just not the closest there <unk> i mean do you know there's just some people that you just feel close to because you know they can relate to you know she cannot relate to me and i can't relate to her i mean she writes to me and stuff and and everything and you know and i write back and she told me you know the reason she wrote me was because i was i was able to to write to her so bluntly and and and and <unk> her when i really thought and stuff like that and that's why <unk> to me but but you know as far as as far as i was actually talking to each other <unk> we never really much got along as far as that came <unk> came about <unk> well then they give you come up here like don't you <unk> you can relate to me somehow you know <unk> probably <unk> someone <unk> you know we we well you're so busy doing your stuff i mean it's not like i mean you're you're very busy <unk> him i mean it's not like well i can just call you up anytime and say oh yeah hey what's up i'm well you know just to talk or whatever you're you're busy you can call me anytime <unk> night you know i'm i'm almost always <unk> yeah i don't know just uh okay so yeah what what <unk> what else okay it's just different [laughter] this is different than <unk> you know what i mean that's <unk> usually think what different no because i just don't feel that that closeness anymore you know i mean granted yeah you know i could probably talk to you and zones over but i don't i don't think you'll you'll really understand where i'm i'm coming from okay and <unk> you know have you felt that time on this when you mean of course i have i mean <unk> know where you actually <unk> all the time well you're a loner are you talking about <unk> you know but what about now well no no i i'm more settled and stuff right and you probably are also more settled <unk> and i'm also you know i don't have any close friends <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and okay and <unk> let's say for example <unk> you tell me all your palms and so and so forth and then i asked you to come up here <unk> okay 'cause i think it's better environment for you <unk> are you willing to leave all that that feeling that you get of not being so alone anymore and uh being settled uncomfortable to move up here well the reason why <unk> <unk> your first one when you buy like that he doesn't use like <unk> have you <unk> ah and also uh i thought that's in santiago zoo anymore you don't really have much of a much in terms of emotional support mhm oh well actually me and him are not together anymore i know so uh you got to still have <unk> how much of a motion that's not true anymore [laughter] oh that's not true anymore no okay so there's somebody you can talk to and stuff uh-huh oh there's somebody from work yes okay that's good yeah and plus i mean you know what <unk> let me tell you something <unk> mean broke up mhm um we still sell a lot of time together and stuff and since then i've been able to talk to him he's been able to talk to me and we actually listened to each other now <unk> stuff like that you know and i mean it's like i just you know what i'm i'm really surprised because all my life i've always felt so alone and i mean it's like when i

another person and the next call was supposed to be somebody else talking to somebody else well that's what we've done for far yes that's right that's why last time when i called i said we'd have

back new new oh okay 'cause i mean we you know we have that on the i mean i don't have any plans to raise it i just didn't know if you wanted <unk> new <unk> okay [noise] hey you know what that i've been dreaming about something and everybody tells me it's not a possibility and um maybe you have to wait until after you're not married anymore i don't know you know what this <unk> what what this has to do but um you know in the philippines foreigners can't buy land <unk> <unk> you know that no i did not oh you have to be a phillipines citizen <unk> oh really well forty wonders you have forty acres <unk> buy [laughter] no but what a lotta people do is of course they have an agreement with a friend and so i would buy land <unk> and the friend would know that it's mine and i wouldn't know that it's mine but it's legal in a friend's name a matter of fact it's a matter of fact in the philippines people can only own certain amount of land because cory akina <unk> through a landry farm so even to find somebody who's willing to put land in their name sometimes it's difficult <unk> <unk> but anyway <unk> okay if i was willing you know i all my brothers and sisters have houses are they laugh yeah and i don't and land you know it's expensive here but i was wondering <unk> the worst part about buying land here is getting a loan from the bank because it's like three hundred percent oh rather <unk> i was wondering if i could get a loan from a bank in the states to buy land and caught and the r. o. rather well i don't even know i don't even know if you could ask a banker that question like <unk> there <unk> oh yeah that wouldn't bother me that uh what about <unk> the hearing that here in the philippines if you're in oh i see oh you have an arabic or that you're you know you're in over your head john that's not even in any of the bank or would even think about i would say i <unk> i would simply asking but what kinda equity like let's say let's say you were <unk> buying a home that <unk> in in philippines you'd have to be in in american money uh fifty thousand dollars <unk> know what i would do is i would take out a loan yes and by the land here clear but you gotta have money to buy the land do you have the money to buy the land how much you have to know how much land yes okay let's see <unk> just bring my calculators up there isn't like please <unk> just <unk> little black let's say a a let's say a lot was ten thousand dollars <unk> a pretty good size <unk> let's say that <unk> hot and you had to er you tell me you would have two thousand down you got to tell me that because otherwise <unk> going to say well how much does he have down and what's the value is that a true value so you know so let's <unk> real estate there's real estate agents here and everything they knew that verify that okay fine so let's said was ten thousand would you have two thousand down or three thousand down or what cause the bank give i'm going to you know maybe in a year i could okay 'cause the bank isn't gonna give you more than about seventy eighty percent <unk> seventy percent i would say would be a norm that they would give you seven thousand ten thousand dollar a purchase is what i'm <unk> <unk> ah so you'd have to have the other three i don't think any bank you know nobody here even in the states can borrow on an empty piece of property or more than seventy percent of what and then they have to show that they have the ability to to make payments on <unk> and so forth i don't know well well you know those are all things i thought about before <unk> you know i mean i was thinking here ten thousand times twenty five is two hundred and fifty thousand twenty five dollars oh it's two hundred and fifty thousand pesos oh are you going <unk> thousand <unk> <unk> okay divided by three thousand pesos per square meter right now at this place i'm looking at is eighty three not definitely eighty three hundred yeah no eighty three two thousand two hundred and fifty thousand divided by three it's eighty <unk> eighty <unk> let's let's go back like let's say i want a three hundred square meter piece of property for three hundred times three is nine hundred thousand pesos yeah your sewing divided by twenty five pesos into a dollar oh lord you can tell me that just property's worth that kinda money oh yeah oh oh yes well <unk> let's go backwards here let's go backwards um three thousand pages of okay three thousand pages of divided by twenty five what is tim hundred is it okay this is a hundred and twenty a hundred and twenty dollars per square meter okay okay so a hundred and twenty times a hundred and twenty times um let's say three hundred <unk> night that thirty six thousand dollars yeah yeah that's not reasonable at all it's unbelievable oh no it's those are true prices dad oh not for a lot yes <unk> a lot in american money well i guess you'd have to do some so anyway let's just okay let's see what no those are true <unk> okay what i'm not sure <unk> what i'm saying no lending institution in the united states that i can believe that i could think of would give you more than maybe seventy percent of what the value is and i would have to be established so you that okay i'll write about dalia was let's say the value is thirty six thousand dollars <unk> thirty six thousand dollars yeah so you'd have to go on for thirty percent that'd be ten thousand <unk> the bank would <unk> nobody would lead and they can property you put it was a home you know for <unk> bridges if there was a home on it that could be rabid for an income than an institution might say well this is just you know i appreciate that <unk> that's what i mean that's i mean how much is bacon property worth as in in value as opposed to a piece of property with <unk> with the whole monitor that can be rented the bank would say well wait a minute we can that thing don't work if this guy don't make it uh we can rent that partially we get our money back if we only have seventy percent invested <unk> i would say that generally but i'd be glad to talk to but that's generally and in fact seventy percent as high a don't open land or a developer i think would be lucky to get sixty percent because things can change all of a sudden there's no developing there's no sewer water available or something well these are these are lots <unk> their prime lots obviously they're cheaper ones available there's <unk> there's a subdivision you remember where the airport isn't <unk> yeah there's a subdivision there's <unk> they're building a eighteen hole golf course out there i see and there's a hundred there's a hundred lots available golf course side uh-huh and they're going pretty hot i mean in six months they probably won't be available <unk> but the three thousand pesos per square foot <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> mean per square meter person <unk> three thousand people per square meter oh man and i'm like you know he's <unk> the smallest <unk> available people over there they have any money how <unk> how can they know <unk> just just the opposite is true either the law to have any money or they have <unk> you have lots of people that don't have any <unk> the not so but there is a growing middle class and that's what these lots are targeted at the growing middle class but the middle class is pretty high class if they can spend that kinda money <unk> they don't <unk> they don't spend that they rent the you know these little crackerjack houses <unk> these little matchbox houses are going up about the size of our <unk> and kitchen and there there are three bedroom <unk> not something really not interested in but just as an example <unk> example these houses costs you know i mean people go in debt for twenty five years they're paying they paid like two thousand pages a month for twenty five years you know and uh they pay <unk> you know <unk> the price of the house you know just for the <unk> the bank or might be interested or you'd get clear title <unk> or something has to do it the philippine government that says ah if you leave or something or i don't know how i don't know how what about the property it the property is not mine really correct oh come on the bank is gonna laugh at that if you don't own the property the houses are right oh no <unk> they have <unk> equity they can't you know the house they'd have to move the house in order to get their money if there's something <unk> didn't you know you didn't look through if you didn't <unk> video i'm well anyway it's <unk> anyway they got all the way you love your new <unk> for you do good yeah did <unk> did talk to you about potentially building some <unk> <unk> you did we have in your basement yeah she did <unk> <unk> i think i think we're we're gonna do i i i'm you know because we don't like to build a lotta stuff on the walls i think what i'm going to do is get some pieces of plywood like about two feet like eight feet long and hanging <unk> rafters and put stuff on that because <unk> just build a free just build a free standing <unk> free standing show from the floor yeah we might do that with some blocks or something oh well that that's an idea too yeah but just <unk> <unk> if blocks are cheaper than what well but if you tell them just because you <unk> it's just like we had in the basement yeah but you'd have to set up to being built into the <unk> yeah <unk> instead of being built in the wall they'd be free stand yeah you'd have <unk> fasten them somewhere <unk> the wall or well maybe yeah you'd have to faster they could just be they could just maybe <unk> maybe i would yeah hoping maybe not yeah whatever we yeah i i agree and leona does too we talked about it and it's just money mentioned it and i said yes that's right we can't let that stuff sit there although the basement is nice and dry but it's just well i know it's i know i try and everything yeah it's not it's not the condition of the items notice the fact that kids are down there unsupervised yeah and i can't believe it's only going to be a matter of time before you start <unk> filtering through those i would have to agree that that is a possibility i haven't seen it happen 'cause i we do go down there when they're <unk> they're but yes they could be crawling in that stuff and ah coming up with something that would be well <unk> i i feel so incredibly guilty even asking know but no i i'm living <unk> maybe maybe we could do something different maybe we could actually partition somehow and close it as opposed to try to cause <unk> put it on shelves they're still gonna be able to get outta jon you know i know but i think if they're on shelves with a curtain there would be less likely to stop you know i i dunno partition than whatever's cheapest we just as cheap as we do we just witnessed steffie and stacey down there who were told not to go in the bedroom and they <unk> the bedroom and found christmas presents under the bed i send <unk> when you tell them not to go in the bedroom what the hell are they gonna do they're gonna go in the bedroom and only natural when there are there a lawn let's let you know we were told them not looking <unk> must be something really good there and how i well anyway we'll we'll see what we can do about that it's just that you know some of the things are really some of the things are really <unk> you know <unk> it might look like jump to somebody else has value that <unk> that <unk> that's what i told larry <unk> either <unk> said you don't know what why something is important to them it's not important to you but you don't know why so yeah there's no intent to do any but but uh protected so it doesn't get as well and <unk> feels that way how much more you know all the cousins are down there you know especially you know some of the younger one yeah no they don't know i mean claire it's five years old and she goes up to my office looking for scratch paper sometimes <unk> you know and and they just kids have absolutely no idea what values i'm thinking <unk> song okay okay well the it's it's been noted and we'll take care of it [laughter] well i feel really <unk> and also note that i feel incredibly guilty having to ask you to do i don't i don't know why you know what you're doing <unk> well yeah but i i think you're right i think there is and <unk> and i talked about that very thing that there's a reason enough to be concerned ah to put it in some kind of a condition so that nobody disturbs <unk> and <unk> even though you know somebody might think it's uh not what the hell of a lot that's none of our affair because yeah you guys have a working working we're confused about you guys address okay one three to four or one three it was one <unk> two four six one <unk> one three to four yeah metal viewed as metal view two words are one <unk> two words <unk> an l. and besides it's late metal view lane but <unk> i guess but yes i see your last letter just <unk> <unk> so there is no metal views three no there is not that's right okay but <unk> important but i mean not yet because there's no metal street but <unk> somebody in the future you never know the <unk> okay <unk> one three to four yep yep and what did you say you noticed that my last letter what that you addressed admit <unk> view instead <unk> view lane but that's not a concern right right because now did that last letter have a visa bill and yeah and and also named all up to the to the bank yes and that was interesting i have in front of me i went to the bank with this and he said i don't know why you brought that here because that's a receipt that john has project that stop stop payment right but <unk> they said on that it's set on

whether that guys stopped are now okay <unk> i haven't my records is if it's all right i'll do that tomorrow i'll do that i i don't know that's the problem that's no problem with <unk> i should've just dropped it in the mail you know separately but since the check and i was sending <unk> anyway i just thought <unk> more safe to have everything in one i gotta tell ya i was surprised when i saw that letter that other letter that you had included to send to your visa <unk> that had to stamps on it you know those are you still there twenty nine cent stamp three cents <unk> there were three cents down yes [laughter] oh that's funny i just thought they were i thought they were twenty nine cents <unk> not not only that your friend at the post office you know <unk> yeah [laughter] it had to

centers i said three sets i said well you must have just had a couple of stabs left that he'd you know what happened is you know what happened when it went up to thirty two i had twenty nine cents

[laughter] well it was funny because <unk> said <unk> probably just had a couple of stabs and want to use them up and that's why you said it on so that they'd be used so all they had <unk> pay the balance between dirty doing six cents so oh bummer <unk> the next time i'm well i didn't know how much it weighed cutting off it needed <unk> yeah well that's why i had two of them on there wasn't over <unk> the next time uh u._c. jen tell her that land claire started collecting stamps i don't know if that really yeah i <unk> yeah so i won of an old man wrote us not an old man he was telling my

but we have extensive gardens here institute and so students will usually go out to a garden setting because it's all but more comfortable <unk> and then after a break for lunch students return and we have a complete slip of um instruction and that instead of textbook and clinical type instruction we have hands on and we have we offer workshops and <unk> weeding regional cooking <unk> i'm <unk> jump <unk> pottery and have a large groups we also also offer um folkloric dance and those are two hours a day monday through thursday and they're really in place not so much to teach students a craft but they're in place to facilitate spanish language acquisition <unk> with the hands on project um it's our our beliefs that using the language will give students that opportunity to have better retention each time they use it they feel a little bit more comfortable the vocabulary expands and whatnot and then the last hour is a daily um inner <unk> and that's where someone from the community and walk it comes to the institute and they were <unk> with one of our students one on one conversation partner and if the student here <unk> english speaking english being their native language then half the time would be an english half the time would be in spanish mhm and we offer um included in the course are lectures weekly lectures and do we have films and other cultural presentations and all that is included within the same package we also offer optional tours on the weekends going to a point of interest around <unk> well <unk> as if you're familiar with <unk> but it's not that i'm really rich with archaeological sites and indigenous marketplaces and craft villages yeah so there's a lot to see the program geared primarily toward i'm i'm <unk> <unk> oh no [laughter] no we offer seven different levels ranging from true beginners people who know absolutely nothing about spanish all the way up through advanced and literature levels uh so we have something for everybody when you arrive we would give you a placement test it's a two part tests the first part is written and it would test you on present tense um direct and indirect objects goes all the way up through subjunctive and then you actually do some writing as well and after <unk> instructor would grade that then they would <unk> <unk> would ah speak with you and that would be the second portion of the test they would ask you a lot of questions about why you're here sitting spanish um where you're from why are you interested in spanish particular as opposed to some other language have you visited other places within mexico and whatnot they're really zeroing on how you use the language when you're speaking <unk> that helps them to more fine tune where they place you know it's <unk> <unk> how many people are are in each group a maximum according to our brochures can although we have never had a group of ten um averages more around six and and it can be lower uh we've had groups of one before that group i don't think that's a group [laughter] and um how long <unk> <unk> the program it's designed to last for weeks but students can come by the week if they wish we advise if they do come by the week that they try to come at the beginning of the session so they don't have instructional gaps you know when for example if the classes going on three weeks and then we suddenly have a student arrive the end of the second or third week it can be a little bit difficult enough student little enter into a class it's been in session already two or three weeks i'm we frequently though do have students who don't arrive at the beginning because their their schedules don't allow them to have you know conformity to our our schedule and they they do it i have been a student here several times myself i'm now the assistant director <unk> and when i first came i came the last two weeks of the december session and the first two weeks of the january session and it was doable it was it was difficult the last two weeks but i did it it was the only time i had to operate with and so it was all right and then of course the january session when i started with the rest of the group at the beginning of the session was more easy to to to feel the flow of the class right away because the ground rules were there in front of me uh-huh and <unk> or the accommodations there on premises or no we we offer several options the the vast majority <unk> take host family homes as ah the way to go when they're here and <unk> they pay 'em a base price of eleven dollars a day and that includes uh private room and i'm full breakfast and it may or may not included private bath really depends on each family we tell the students that it's not a hotel it's it's a it's a home [noise] and the idea isn't so much for luxury it's more for um really communicating with people and getting to know the culture by way of the people and the vast majority of the homes are upper middle class to lower upper class are very nice homes and their families that we've worked with for years [noise] um if a student wishes other meals with the host family for an additional four dollars a day the student can have come meet <unk> which is large midday meal and you can eat very very well and walk on four dollars but the the four dollar meal would be primarily for purposes of interacting with the host family and then there's the cena which is a very light very late evening meal that's anywhere between seven thirty nine o'clock at night that's an additional two dollars um it can be as simple as pandulce say in a couple of hot chocolate mhm but uh and it's not it's not <unk> it's not a formal meal the way the the sane is would be possible to comedy vegetarian aha oh yeah we do that all the time <unk> i used to it especially here and <unk> was mexico in general with tortillas and beans and all the the wealth of fruits and vegetables that would be very simple if if students don't want <unk> stay and they wish to have a um alternative accommodations we can help with apartments and hotels and that sort of thing um they would need to send a deposit but i'm a lot of people when they call us they don't really speaking of spanish or they don't feel comfortable enough with their spanish to make reservations other hotels close bond slots yeah okay <unk> i'm <unk> you offer workshops and cooking will mhm mhm <unk> we're doing pottery mhm and sometimes <unk> folkloric dance and and that's all incorporated into the program uh-huh too and i'm through food um i wanted to enroll in the beginning <unk> room <unk> um that would also be for six weeks <unk> you know for weeks four weeks let's see <unk> could you give me some ideas were <unk> the price to pay the prices at one time fifty dollar registration fee and four hundred dollars for the session or one hundred dollars by the week or one hundred but we mhm and um and you have any more printed information um we have a brochure uh-huh will be possible <unk> when we weren't sure will let me grab a piece of paper hold on just one moment [noise] okay okay my name is richard again because they are laughing <unk> gee they and i know 'cause i'm in my

probably will end up settling at home yeah you know what i mean eventually yeah i mean i don't know how long it you know you won't be tons of time 'cause then 'cause that would be hard to if you spent

right and then send you were going to go back and be strangers again it's gonna be another yeah know whole big you'll you'd be surprised how attached you'll be at five years to here yeah yeah see i

um because i'd be i'd be i'd be just <unk> <unk> right and i think that <unk> and i'm glad i didn't because i actually had a um a fairly relaxing couple days but and it was also just nice to be be around here for christmas mhm right how long were you back at your <unk> your mother's oh like a week you sound like here in washington last friday before you know what you're saying and half <unk>

as your mom <unk> <unk> everybody's fine how about your family <unk> pretty good they're all actually they've got more to do up in northern michigan they've they ever end doing lancing michigan and there's always something going on [laughter] rather engaged or something you know he came over when he came over with his girlfriend and to london this past summer i um but they're not a game dinner <unk> i i don't think that's the books [laughter] uh so many people are getting married in the street <unk> from our class <unk> well <unk> got married <unk> yeah and <unk> saw her and her husband <unk> well <unk> you know sickness david david aged wow did you hear <unk> heard the story of narrow well it starts with someone who wouldn't going out with this woman named maria like last year <unk> mister like five or something of course not serious or whatever and the fact broke up with him this spring and it's the same time she was moving to new york for a new job and she <unk> david <unk> couple times just by being friends of mine and david threw me had moved out recently one of his roommate soap maria said oh david can i just stay in your roommate's apartment for you know like finding new gets adult [laughter] and you can imagine the rest of the still out there and then like of course had already broken up and moved up there and then like <unk> they just like come on and that's it so then they went to italy over like between christmas and new year's <unk> i'm currently fine and he proposed to her broom <unk> can you really that's great i i can't believe that that's <unk> travel <unk> met this woman <unk> matter yeah in fact the funny thing <unk> i've seen her <unk> a few times <unk> parties dinner <unk> when she's going on some on yeah she's been with david new york i've never seen her i mean i've been to new york and david but like when she was sick and then when she was out of town when i when they're selling like haven't seen the two together but she's great and she's really sweet nice and she works for she worked for p._b._s. before now she's working for a small like documentary company and he's still working for um roman goldman yeah <unk> trying to decide if you can <unk> least get a better job <unk> yeah so he doesn't know what's going to do and i'm still latin american you know <unk> knew division in nineteen <unk> tell you what it is i never quite clear if it's like capital markets or something it's more general it's not <unk> <unk> what's he doing um a was he in corporate finance before or even twenty or <unk> or is that you know <unk> was he in um wasn't banking ray had nothing to do backing him <unk> in the banking right <unk> not the bank it sounds like it was more working with clients <unk> the only time <unk> where do you make <unk> america we're trying to buy or sell 'em like companies <unk> they call <unk> services and i'm usually part of the corporate finance okay actually i reason i ask is uh investment banks have been driving me crazy for the last year <unk> ah we have a lot of we we do a lot of <unk> every investment bank i think in the world has come to dodge telecom <unk> trying to business with us but i thought you got goldman has your band <unk> privatization right <unk> that's the problem <unk> <unk> i was a problem either learn myself what investment banks do [laughter] um because uh they're bankers i mean they they clearly all our bankers you learn that after <unk> dealing with them while they're right <unk> uh they're not um they're not consult mhm um as as many and like to think they are they're uh they're bankers and um there's a there's the equity people and there's <unk> that people and then there's the strategic advisor <unk> people <unk> um and there's <unk> the equity people they are the equity people are all about trying to raise a equity for companies that with david yeah you <unk> any capital market that sounds right i can't remember that's pretty used to do right and that's where that's where i guess that they would um they get involved in initial public offering the stock offerings companies yea listing companies i'm exchanges creating a a depositories seats in the united states for foreign companies and so forth right all sorts of things just to raise capital on public markets mhm and then there's the dad's side which is um decide which deals and bonds <unk> they they go out and try and find buyers for bombs usual investments and then you've got the um uh the the traders stocks and bonds and very <unk> and and the <unk> i don't know if i do foreign exchange but then i'm sure they do have even that hedging and stuff and that aside from all those clear cut kind of special uh a focus services they've got their <unk> least the big ones like goldman sachs and others have their strategic advisor services now goldman sachs that works for telecom in privatization um they are and the equity side they're they're doing with david <unk> right <unk> working with us to to um help sell us as a company mhm to investors on the public market on the stock exchanges in tokyo and new york was a frankfurt london and so forth but the the the investment banks that arriving me crazy are always strategic investors because they show up and they what they are out there to do is there's a lot of companies that they can't either can't raise money you know they can't raise the type of money they want <unk> changes <unk> they don't have enough credit worthiness to go out and get a bond <unk> um uh so the way they want to get capital is through offering their strategic stake in their companies selling a piece of the company i'm a <unk> you know uh the changes hands privately selling <unk> piece of the company to a foreign investor usually with this <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> for example i mean um without a free day real deals mhm um companies will come <unk> you know there there's a lot of uh a lot of telecommunication companies that that uh that come out and and they look for um for for <unk> you know for a strategic a strategic and that's what they're looking for somebody to buy it might be wine to privatize and two or three years <unk> but i'm in the meantime they want to shape up their company so they'll sell what twenty five percent of the company to a private to foreign investor and for investor will come in and and and restructure the company and then together they'll go uh go to the stock market and it's an opportunity as a big opportunity for a lot of companies out there but <unk> that what you're dealing that's your realm of partly yes um i mean i work at area uh which is involved in international <unk> foreign investments mhm um and and actually the whole range of of foreign business and um you know what area is our global partnership with sprint and <unk> and the other <unk> is our foreign <unk> foreign investments okay and so uh we get all these like i say we got to that's what <unk> coming to us and uh you know they're <unk> they're they're sale i mean they they they've got something to hide or some company that come to them and they said <unk> buyer and uh [noise] it uh they really can get on your nerves so what what are you going to go to tell him <unk> for example <unk> you're going to come for well those were uh those are just consultations man [laughter] but like with <unk> with companies that you might <unk> with with investment banks with companies <unk> yeah gosh i didn't know you were into [laughter] yeah financial market area lights yeah that's i mean unfortunately <unk> it's actually been quite good it's been quite interesting uh i never knew anything about really that area before have you not taken cordon's financial markets <unk> class really <unk> uh i mean you hadn't taken hadn't taken anything like that so i never knew really you know uh what uh how did you know how you uh what what you were <unk> you know what a strategic sale was one <unk> investment banks of do and so i <unk> that's actually been quite interesting learning that um but at the end of the day uh that's kind of a prerequisite that kind of knowledge of of what the opportunities are kind of a deal or what kind of a deal um uh what what's what's a business opportunity <unk> um is essential to do the do the job but um it's not i wouldn't say it's the main focus of what i should be doing <unk> strategic planning um is more general sense it's a step back from the deal making um which is done by the new the development people usually and i take a step back and it's more <unk> and and the the word the strategic platter usually does yeah <unk> the market so for example i would analyze asia i look at asia and i'd see uh divide the market up into into segments such as tell a a <unk> a value <unk> data you know data services for business customers or cable t._v. or um and maybe mobile a mobile a cellular serving <unk> divided up into you know a business segments and i would look across the countries of the region and i would see where the gross potential is the greatest and um you know where the market's i'm mature enough where the the regular toy environment is liberal enough that you could actually get in 'em and you can order company and not have problems with the government mhm um and then then you look and just basically where <unk> are there any opportunities out there are any other governments giving out new license like in the united states with all p._c._s. license or with uh the reforming of the u._s. talking locations system i'm looking for things like that and if there weren't things like that but i still thought that the market was incredibly are moving then i might look to uh other options such mergers and acquisitions and that's where these investing nicely <unk> <unk> they're all out there <unk> some kind of agree [laughter] oh god i spoke to why wasn't months ago [noise] well i think a month ago was water mine my son was months ago <unk> was was awhile ago yeah that was awhile ago but um we uh i guess it's it's <unk> it's interesting this whole <unk> learning a little bit about like corporate finance and right and i just described use the kind of what i watch the strategic planning <unk> should be doing um i can't say i get around to doing that <unk> <unk> um it's it's been interesting but and the other hand it's not been bring home filling mhm um because i see a great deal potential to do a lot of things to learn a lot of things but we don't get around and we just don't get around very much <unk> they just they haven't um we haven't figured out quite a that <unk> we we have too many things to do with two people right yeah and so we <unk> as a consequence don't get anything done [laughter] and there's <unk> few <unk> <unk> and the few people that we do have that are really gung ho and and on guys year <unk> want to um you know want to get a lot of things done but a lot of them are <unk> you know i i consider myself a novice mhm and then i i never learned all this on the job and uh you know i can do that it just you know it takes time um i uh i started over this this job almost a year ago now and i mean this particular job <unk> been there i've been there for a year and a half but i started this particular job and treated you probably about a year ago and uh it's uh been uh you know i i thought when i came out i would you know three months we'd have some strategic planning on the table and not yet well it's <unk> little longer than i thought and partly because there's a lot of people that are just novices mhm and and and you know people will learn from each other but it's you know it's like <unk> say a couple of bad tennis players earning from each other <unk> you gotta have a few good tennis players out there to to kind of coach along and and and then you just gotta play hard ball you know or mixing metaphors but play hardball with <unk> and and and you pick it up and you learn it but we're this this habit of relying on you know the same old people and not respect in the fact that you just need new qualified fresh blood that knows what they're doing <unk> and so i i can't say that's really a a been all that fulfilling it's it's been interesting and and and my my bosses have always ah been been good and and and we've got along well and they seem to like the work that i do so uh so so they reward me and i i continue to do my job but i'm a <unk> a month after month i keep thinking it's and it's got to get better than this yeah but [noise] i haven't been too concerned i figure i got a job like going to do anything <unk> i'm getting a new boss next week <unk> and and we'll see how that goes but the other day i figured i missed that other priorities and the job and uh if you know if the if if uh some point if i get tired of the job i mean if some point at some point i think it's just a matter of time before i say you know that said forget it yeah so are you getting your partner or what are you doing ah yeah i'm looking for an apartment <unk> yeah <unk> uh electr apartment cologne mhm well i started looking for an apartment in bonn didn't uh didn't um uh had much luck <unk> actually found one didn't get into it and i found one she said she ran to me but then she never moved out um [noise] she said she wants to move on but she still has thing with her her new landlords i'm over about six months now um that i look for an apartment cologne where i thought the action would be a little bit better mhm and um i didn't work out too well there's really no apartments that ah the market was so tight and cologne <unk> that the departments would uh they'd be gone before you you know where you get a hold of them and and if you don't live in cologne there was no way to get out there and see 'em before before the people the slower jonathan claire snatched up so quickly so i'm looking for another apartment a little bit further away <unk> great <unk> now that i'm gonna i'm gonna be <unk> i i think getting the chance of pretty good 'cause the uh the town i'm looking in amarillo apartments mhm and uh what's the name of the town mhm frank for all the time <unk> i thought you meant like little <unk> come on now are you looking for <unk> wow yeah that would be fine yeah <unk> yeah a little bit far away <unk> if i did that i i <unk> i'd uh i'd have to just commute on the weekends or where would you say oh you say okay the for the weekend green for another time exactly work out <unk> work out i mean it wouldn't <unk> obviously that would also be a a a solution forever yeah um and that's why i know that you know shorter long term uh it it kind of means the and the dutch telecom mhm but uh but i figure uh there's no need for me i mean i've got actually more i'm more pressure to more pressure for myself i'm to find an apartment and find a new job uh even though i know there are opportunities out there um i i think i'd you know i want the eye can muddle along at the telecom but i can't i can't model and bought anymore right they need a place right to call my own [laughter] well that sounds good to find out anyway right now you're going <unk> did you say you're going into the weekend yeah i'm going to this weekend uh-huh yep go down and look for apartments tomorrow mhm and ah which is uh i actually uh i worked out fine now i wasn't too keen on it 'cause i was just there last weekend for new years mhm and uh it was uh uh i can recognize it's kinda tough or the commute is tough i've been going down every weekend but i think it'll be easier if i had my own place mhm against going down going down and staying with other people it's right in the last time it's stressful because you always and <unk> you always feel like you're in posing a bit and and it's always the special you'd never quite home mhm so well that sounds like when i come to washington state near me on weekends i mean i come more than he comes <unk> because i had and i will have again fridays off oh so i would come down thursday night <unk> monday morning <unk> but yeah it was the manners lugging my stance packing every time we did was i mean i kept telling <unk> house but still <unk> mine and everything's not fair <unk> just <unk> it's yeah it's just it's two hour train right same thing it's the same thing <unk> the train station cab you know so i said i wasn't gonna do it coming semester <unk> maybe <unk> done when i got here yeah <unk> yeah yeah <unk> yeah it's not a solution for a long term but i think uh i think i could i think i'd like to do it for for a few months just to see <unk> mean worst comes to worst thing i thought you know <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> i had the worst comes <unk> really brought up and i love my job but i could just give it up again um but i mean the doors <unk> [laughter] but um ah i don't see that happening so when you get to go in order to stay well i've got <unk> i don't know i mean it seems like i taught myself out of trips and foreign travel more than i am into it i uh i was supposed to be in to uh my my trip <unk> from <unk> <unk> it was actually as postponed <unk> and <unk> and and and so i was going to go next week for the whole week oh fine and i talk to my boss just the other yesterday and then uh we have <unk> whether it was worth it and we decided that it was going <unk> [laughter] so i'm i'm not going to tokyo and then i was supposed to go on the twenty ninth and thirtieth to hong kong again and um again we talked about it and decided it's not worth <unk> <unk> um and so i'm

asia pacific north uh central and south america [laughter] so [laughter] um yeah western and a deer the uh uh the uh eighty percent because then i believe in in eastern tennessee <unk> is it called eastern near here and then i don't know <unk> there's <unk> no i never hear from him why are you going to get the far east in the far east um it's got to get out of the eastern recently [laughter] but

and and it was always <unk> with america's <unk> and um i i was just always wondering <unk> our europe and europe and and uh in in asia pretty much across i mean they're pretty much across the world can be done across the river mutually yeah um so i guess it's somewhere in the atlantic in the pacific is the is the line [laughter] um but any rate uh eastern atmosphere yeah anyway but i i haven't had much chance to to to to get involved and and uh that part of my job <unk> should dealing with north central south america [laughter] um maybe this year <unk> maybe this year i've actually been a when <unk> new boss comes out i've i've kind of declared a asia uh part of not part of my court confidence seats so i sort of said you got to find somebody that does a little bit closer to asian than

and then and then like god i feel sick you know mhm oh yeah and <unk> can just extend the analogy and all kinds of ways although like with with <unk> new i've written you about it [laughter] it's like yes i will take that with no return policy [laughter] yeah yes yeah and <unk> guarantee on the labor <unk> [laughter] exactly exactly you just <unk> as far as i'm concerned and i'll be up mhm mhm [laughter] so i get an any know any what now are you getting any no [laughter] well i did when i went home um i like living with my ex boyfriend of mine um oh is that the one that you <unk> the <unk>

that and he's just he's just you know he's a lot of people but it's funny 'cause michelle over break hooked up with someone very similar who i went out with one night i'm just <unk> just hate us and they're the people that you can only tolerate on a on a one on one level <unk> not you don't take any where you don't introduce them to they're your friends you don't want them talk [laughter] it's

but um it's just he's so he's just a little weird that way we were talking about him at dinner tonight and apparently this one guy had met him when <unk> when they first met there were sitting at dinner in the in the dorm on the meal plan and everything and uh and and they were talking about i guess one of them runs any <unk> <unk> the guy the hooked up with you know um oh do you run or something i'm thinking about his running something and it's like oh yeah do you run <unk> answer your freaked out it's like why why do i look like i'm not [laughter] [laughter] so he's just a little [laughter] but i guess so when you know i don't know i'm right now i'm just sort of like okay i'm just having a good time and uh when i get up and then when <unk> when they go into the city with michelle and we're going to get all <unk> up and go into the mission district and <unk> with the news <unk> men out there nice i yes nice i like to have such such a an option [laughter] to through

with my parents have gotten um some new like sort of nautilus type equipment and they've <unk> yeah well it's like they have one of those aerobics ryder things which are there yeah yeah yeah and they have a an exercise bike in a rowing machine basically i just would parking for the t._v. and work out oh yeah this is the new the elena [laughter] can you believe in <unk> i i i'm actually thinking now that i'm back and now that i'm sort of pumped up a little bit of learning how to really like lifts and really going <unk> sculpted look [laughter] beyond that maybe <unk> maybe <unk> parttime female body building just affects my mother's some more [laughter] she doesn't think your lady for she doesn't she doesn't like every time <unk> body builders come on t._v. she has a fit so oh that's funny [laughter] your mother how was carmen i'm mama's praying that like her separation from her husband is just around the corner <unk> really yeah although they've been married for like twenty seven years but um apparently she's quite unhappy and things are they getting worse lately 'cause 'cause the sun has been away at college um yeah they just they just have to deal with each other and they you know you know she almost moved to the states <unk> remember that because i mean i do notice last minute was what okay when she was going to move knew when your parents why wasn't she right <unk> <unk> yeah in chicago but she was the last minute you know he wasn't going to go and she didn't want to sort of have a you know you can't really commute between you know chicago in puerto rico and uh no [laughter] unfortunately and for whatever reason she had she decided to stay but she really she still not very happy but <unk> it's it's it's strange i don't quite understand i haven't really talked to her in a long time <unk> she's okay that'd be came home and they went to the beach on christmas [laughter] oh i know i know i really want to go back although you know i can't explain girl because it's like i mean i could be wearing a little longer and sandals today you know oh my gosh yeah ooh wait what where's the school that you're going to work and [noise] well i'm applying to schools there's one in france i'm applying to okay it's an international school and then i'm also apply and there's an agency in boston that they did like receive openings from all sorts of independence goes around the country and then they they'll send like mine see me to the schools they think i'll be best suited to uh based on the openings that they receive okay so so the the reason i listed for my preference our california in san francisco particular <unk> um new mexico [noise] which i think it was very cool yeah and <unk> those are my three top choices and then um where else i said colorado would be okay new york city maybe but i'm i'm <unk> the thing is i'm just really strongly lead into the west coast yeah i think you should come out <unk> i think i would like that the best and i and i don't i don't want to go back to to boston or cambridge i'm just not interested in that area anymore right right i mean i guess i guess i when i left there i was i decided that i was leaving when i was not coming back i mean it certainly acts up to visit but not to live <unk> so anyway so that's yeah that's what i'm up to <unk> and i'm really excited about it so far anyway my parents were my parents were a little surprised but that's all right yeah well i really hope <unk> never cisco although france also sounds like fun although i don't know my friend my friend claire she's in she's in paris on that tower fellowship at the very are and uh she well <unk> problem is it like she's anorexic and she can't stand she's like all the french are so fast [laughter] and i'm like well she says oh they eat fatty foods and they don't exercise and told her she can't find a decent you know gym and <unk> and the food it's all fatty and she can't eat right <unk> and so she's she's upset about that but <unk> also have been upset i don't know <unk> or the strikes over have you heard about that because it was really hate is if she could <unk> that they <unk> i think they are over now because they were supposed to end right before christmas uh-huh and so as long as i know they are over now and i can't remember i think as you pay the prime minister was supposed to we're supposed to be some measure harlem where he was going to address the strike issue uh-huh so anyway but that's all that i've i've paid attention to so far so no i i'm i'm taking french this year and i haven't seen my french teacher back in town yet so [laughter] so i mean maybe they aren't over i don't know <unk> got <unk> i hope they are over because she was really <unk> usually bonding about that too <unk> <unk> some road trip that a city cause she just couldn't stand it any more really yeah how does she liked the course she doing a p._h._d. you know she's she's doing a one year <unk> she's not getting a degree from it as far as i can tell but she was originally <unk> economics courses and work part time at the uh not the world bank but it's some sort of similar organization affiliated with the european economic community or something something i don't know <unk> keep right straight um but that fell through for the first semester the work opportunity and the <unk> the economics courses turn that but she's done basically all that work i'm at school already in college and uh mhm so she wasn't thrilled about that <unk> she decided to stop taking courses and just sort of odd it a bunch of ah you know our history and things seemed more interesting to her yeah i mean i think it's a totally sweet deal like they pay for her everything and all <unk> do you do anything you just have to sort of be there you know that's so cool yeah totally i'm i'm <unk> and now she's gotten a job for this semester at that wherever it is that you're supposed to work she's happy about that 'cause she's felt i think she's <unk> she said too much free time and really not enough sense of what to do with it and unfortunately they called <unk> it's sort of known for not being the most friendly place studying apparently the students they're really <unk> i'm <unk> like exceptionally so and so she felt that and i haven't really made friends she can hang out with which is really too bad 'cause if you're at a foreign country and you don't feel like if anybody you hang out with that can be really isolating <unk> but but i think i think it will be better for her because she'll be able to work twenty hours a week at the u._c. and she decided to join <unk> she finally found a club she likes <unk> she's going to join a gym and work out you know it'd be a completely fat free person [laughter] but [laughter] we'll make it much easier for her anyone <unk> well i mean i can't i mean i shouldn't you know she's been helpful to me because like when i first started losing weight i really wanted any didn't help with like figuring out what to eat and what not to eat and wouldn't have to exercise and everything and i wrote to her i was like well actually my virtual trainer and tell me today the sun how often <unk> and she was really good on that obviously 'cause she thinks about all the time <unk> well what do you eat now oh i don't eat anything i just drink water all the time you know why well right now the the dining hall clothes so basically i eat a lot of salads um i eat a lot of fat free stuff i've been watching fat content a lot um mhm i eat less of everything um and when i mean snack instead of running to the vending machine like i was in north house i yeah i always had like vegetables in my refrigerator and i just snack on like carrot sticks or pepper slices or something like that [noise] ah that's so cool yeah and and when when when term time rolls around you know i have like a you know my usual breakfasts like cereal and jews i've cut down on the trees i drink too i drink a lot more water mhm and then i have like a bag lunch um you know when your food and a sandwich and like you know vegetables dust and drink water and then dinner i always get like some sort of rice and steamed vegetables things soon in throughout you know and then the protein but yeah it's <unk> really <unk> the food is really is not that good and my dining hall so <unk> so it's easier for me given that just sort of put myself into a routine right the same thing the same sort of standard <unk> every day and then i'll <unk> every couple of weeks or like on the weekend i'll have like french toast you know for <unk> for one day and i'm like what i look forward to um so yeah it's not like a completely you know eliminate sort of course i had you know chocolate over christmas ahead you know you know i ate the turkey with the gravy and all that but <unk> generally i'm just really cut down and you know i've i've been going to aerobics all <unk> um they have aerobics and i've been going to last week which is not a lawyer twice <unk> not a big deal and um i did all these exercises when i was at home i went swimming sometimes that would work out twice a day um just because there was nothing else to do [laughter] i'll just get in shape [noise] um and it's really worked out well they really had it my my friend michelle is like really skinny so that's what's <unk> <unk> as well 'cause i oh i've never i i don't consider myself to be like attractive but i don't want to be you know and <unk> and you know oh i i i understand what you mean but i mean you certainly are not [laughter] and all the ugly friend at all and <unk> you think you and all that oh i'm so happy for you that's great yeah it's really good and [noise] i mean i you know i don't know if i wrote you this at all but i was considering for a while i was considering transferring back to harvard because you know <unk> yeah you know who was writing to me and uh uh-huh and saying you know i'm <unk> <unk> if you want to you know i uh monday missions committee you can come back and uh just you know you can just it's real easy to apply you know i really love to work with you blah blah he even asked if i wanted to present with him at a conference not just <unk> conference but the confidence of the field i'm in law yeah and i'm going to do it um mhm present with him on a panel which is so great isn't that <unk> awesome and <unk> you know he's like happy doing what you mean through and everything and <unk> and i was really tempted because like i haven't met anyone here yet who could be that kind of an advisor right though i mean because he's so put himself out for me and really like has made it very clear that he's willing to you know really good about for me which was really nice you know and i always like you know he always anticipates every <unk> everything that i want to do you know <unk> which is really nice um [noise] but i was very close to even requested application i talked to secretary i'm <unk> i felt like you know i haven't had the chance to get to work with the people that i originally came here to work with and right i and i will <unk> this next semester but i need to make the decision to apply last month i'm glad i wasn't gonna apply if i wasn't going to go because i wanted to have the option if things don't work out this year to apply next year you know what i'm saying <unk> yeah and they want i i just didn't think that they would um take me i five rejected them twice in a row you see what i'm saying <unk> minute <unk> applied next year it would work so okay so it's really i'm i'm yeah i'm surprised that you were that you can sit i mean well i was i i guess i'm really surprised that you turned them down in the first place i mean once you 'cause i remember when you came back from berkeley yeah because you were just like totally sold on it i berkeley yeah yeah and then and it sounds like you're really happy there am i am now yeah well i mean academically it hasn't been as much fun as it has been socially i've had <unk> lose your classes this fall i'm <unk> and you know there are several people in my cohort did the exact same schedule and feel the same way they're just like lame professors lame classes the people <unk> great i really liked the um <unk> but you know the work just hasn't been as as far as i thought it would be i don't think <unk> i don't think it's just like grad school versus college i think it's actually like to sort of poorly taught for the organized classes but <unk> they're not with people that i plan to do my work with so okay i really can't judge the program based on that and also the libraries sucks like i really i'm really really sucks i'm no they they just renovated dancing too and they're like really proud of it but it's it's so it's not a place where you can get any work done um that's what i mean what about the books and journals that they have i mean do they because then the perspective i mean the thing that they sent me the really proud of the library and then when does this thing <unk> the library i mean the chances of finding the book on the shelf are very small there's been so much theft that i think numbers the numbers are not right because i think they still count books that are gone oh they will not <unk> order books that are stolen but why not only request and they don't have a budget for it i'm all right budget or like the response to everything they uh uh we've got about five more minutes i think they um they uh distracting here they um loan out a lot of things to the other u._c.s because they share they have their own online catalogue but then they have one that's a big online catalogue it's shared by all the u._c.s and yeah the results

branches are the three there's four branches <unk> wow this is the fourth branch and there's two buildings and we're now the colonia branch which basically was all the fishermen up in the that's pretty much by arsenio's neighborhood it's well you got <unk> that's pretty good area though you come down and they come down your street uh-huh well my street is is if you've whether i should be and what branch now the district president said i was in the colonia and that's where i stayed because everyone was half and half deciding whether whether what branch i should be it but um the district president has made a decision <unk> i don't there's really no one on my street into branch yard so how much i know it's a dancer mean that's how much does it cost to live down there is it you know think <unk> <unk> what's the exchange rate and all that <unk> bad it's thirteen point five exchange um i think i don't know like for example this home we're renting for about three hundred american dollars a month or so very not not expensive at all no huh no i'm going to say like a small farm but then <unk> then we we don't pay a lot for like should we pay maybe less than a hundred dollars for lectures city we have our air conditioners and our fans and things pay nothing hardly for water and anything else that basically your only utility so you're inside your phone you're pretty nice home uh-huh you got air conditioning we put we put we put a thousand <unk> probably at least <unk> thousand to fifteen hundred dollars into the home when we got we rewired the home and i put electric generator little block house outside to do that and doing the things that we did all around and make it um and then you mounted it's nice we screen that home what's that what's american <unk> air conditioning we put um and we we brought 'em down entire container full of all of our things we bought and all of our furniture and our beds and our air conditioners and off corbin's toys and closing his basically filled the container and patty put up the borders are things that <unk> you know when we <unk> we move outta here we will never be able to recoup i won't take the wire out of the home but um as long as we can stay here a couple of years paying three hundred dollars a month is you know it's not we paid four hundred and four fifty <unk> in ohio and then had a you know half the size of a home and but just because it's a nice home it's and it's nothing there's nothing wrong with it but it's not a palace either you know it has we have three bedrooms we have two bathrooms kitchen and living room and a dining room and a nice porch out front and lemon tree in the back <unk> kind of nice neighbors didn't real nice neighborhood around that area down too so it's not it's not bad at all the cost of living um horrible thing like when we go into the capital buy groceries like today i was in the capitals i brought home a bunch of groceries and we have a freezer and and and <unk> along with our freezer infringe raider so we can keep products i'm <unk> but you still don't have a supermarket or anything have one but it just doesn't have the products that will go in and buy like a hundred dollars worth of meat at a crack and stuff so we can always have good quality things in our american products costs just like they didn't <unk> you know they're real expensive but um will eat lunch dominican things <unk> of course those are are expensive at all i'm just depends i mean one day will eat american one day tonight we had ravioli but <unk> lunch time we had <unk> so i mean the whole <unk> [laughter] i was out <unk> frozen man oh <unk> can you <unk> there's a few things down here that i've always loved so there's this much you know drink as long as i can handle that i'm all right <unk> and all the fruits and vegetables <unk> those things i don't know the cost of living i don't know what the cost of living is in utah or or iowa but it wouldn't be more i mean i know that for <unk> rather than that you pay less <unk> bit balances out <unk> live like in american down here it balances out because the things that you save on you you know you <unk> but if you lived like dominican ain't never had an american products then maybe that much cheaper diapers like diaper <unk> diapers down here we we we brought like we've never had to buy diapers or any any baby products my brother comes out every month <unk> other month than when we came home we came back we brought you know we just made sure we do over shopping up in the states and do those types of things if you can't do that then you probably you know spend a lot more but because we get that luxury we don't spend as much money is probably a lot i got to have those things i mean i guess we do yeah i i guess you really don't have to have 'em because people living in cardboard houses and they live to be ninety two but uh feel we feel like we need him [laughter] well you're used to him and you can afford them <unk> yeah i know that's all <unk> coming out with the kids down there and live like a hermit when you could live here [laughter] you know you can't do that [laughter] no you can't you might feel that it's not <unk> no i i what why would you want to do that you would <unk> short <unk> take it takes the ah the whole fun i'm coming down here you know what i mean we have a maid and and i'm patty didn't know she really liked that she's worked out real well it it's hard to have someone in your home we have her coming she comes in around nine nine thirty and she leaves by about three so she'll come in and help and she'll help make lunch and then she'll clean up and and make sure that all the bathrooms and the floors or mop because it's all tile floors yeah um and make sure everything's cleaned then she goes so she'll watch corbin while patties getting your spanish lesson and she'll do those things and then she'll leave and we have the washer and dryer down here so she

diplomats there but i know well <unk> yeah yeah how's matt <unk> good he um there's like total chaos the u._n. as you might imagine and i'm <unk> his boss pulled he um this other woman who came in through exams like he did and the other lawyer uh-huh and said i don't know what's gonna happen but there's always going to be job for you guys <unk> oh that's nice yeah but they're thinking about getting rid of the entire office [laughter] in a way but the man has a permanent contract and <unk> place him somewhere so in a way it might be a good thing for matt yeah if he got sent to new york or something or would they feel as though they're obligated to play some even though the u._s. isn't paying their dues yeah they don't do it like that i know it's not five burn i know it's not like that really um about about <unk> yeah and i'm not i just found out actually friday that he's on the short list for that job <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> that's nice yeah so i didn't hear that uh he talked well they said when he was leaving they sit in a kind of joking slash serious way i'm don't call last will call you and so he's like you know and <unk> and when <unk> was that december right it's been a while and he's <unk> he's not going to cost you want to be like knack all right <unk> and they said don't call right um but he was able to call the personnel office [noise] in new york and and try to find out through there and then finally he spoke with this woman who knew and say well we just the short list together <unk> i'm assuming it's like three people i mean that's usually what it is um and you're on it and we had to interview people off of it the rest of the people off <unk> so what do you mean well i i guess that means that the other people in the short list weren't interviewed yet huh <unk> inside track thing uh i think what it means that they just screened things amazing applications and matt happened to be so close but matt made <unk> interview happen to know about air that was good for him yeah and now they don't have to find out there or anything right and i'm sure it's <unk> lowered his chances <unk> make the short list yeah i mean i don't know what he does good interview
