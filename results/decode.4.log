zero two seven three three and now that a long time ago though but at least two weeks ago <unk> <unk> i don't know similar and i think it was in the letter that you sent me i think it said i'll drink beer and such and such a date and then she gave me an address so i might not <unk> not have had one then right i didn't get it right for the when did you get there i started work august first so today than eight twenty years or so [laughter] the twentieth yeah um and i ride in detroit just the night before i started work so i've been here <unk> three weeks it'll be three weeks tuesday they started work and um so i worked in the office for <unk> week and a half and then we had our orientation for the new volunteers uh-huh and that was out <unk> western michigan on lake michigan about four hours from here <unk> theory than a week almost a week um did you take your car did you drive there i drove up here yeah from omaha yeah wow it took a couple of days i mean it would have been maybe fourteen or fifteen hours i didn't want to do it on one day swea bright stopped in wisconsin friend's house so [noise] so we have fifty six new volunteers that are oriented enough they left through their new homes on thursday night huh we came back to detroit so how many of you are there on staff right there's five of us on staff the director three area directors and then i don't know what kate potatoes the woman i'm living with i'm not sure what position is called it's kind of like development and helps the director with fundraising i'm not sure what <unk> especially in the director's in detroit yeah we're all in detroit but the area directors um travel to the cities that the volunteers are in and um you know meet with the communities and stuff like that <unk> <unk> your area that i go to kansas city saint louis <unk> the morning and then i also have the community here in detroit oh that's cool so yeah i'm not being around it so you have to go so many times <unk> here i go once in the fall for a week to each city and then once in the spring so well late winter i guess um [noise] so when i go in october i go first or kansas city than to st louis then i came back to detroit and we have our um our fall retreat isn't dubuque iowa so that's in the middle of my area visits and then then i go to that i do my detroit area visits and i go to des moines but the way it works out for kansas city and saint louis i go to kansas city in the end of the week it's my birthday <unk> so i didn't the morning if my birthday with elisa and then i fly to st louis and spend you know the afternoon with chris or <unk> or whoever i hook up with and saint louis so i'm like wow that worked out perfect cool yeah so so it sounds like you're going to be gone a lot yeah from october sixth through <unk> through thanksgiving i'm here like i don't know ten days or something like that um are you going to go home for thanksgiving i don't know yet i'm i'm going home in september for just did a three day weekend or something like that um because september is pretty much the <unk> one of the slowest months on the job so and i haven't been to texas in a while so i thought that would work out and um then at christmas time i think two of my <unk> one of my cousins um is getting married near kansas city and i'm hoping my family will just come up to kansas for that <unk> and then i'll go there and you know i don't know about thanksgiving yet it's too far away [laughter] to figure out so anyway i'm sorry you happy yeah i like it was really hard to make the decision i actually at one point decided no i'm not going to go i i just like <unk> don't think i want to start over again and <unk> and i'm like i'm being and omaha and all that sort of thing and so i called in until the director you know i thought about it a lot blah blah but i just don't think it's right for me right now and mhm he was like i don't know him very well but uh he he'd had strep throat when i was here and he was wasn't feeling well and <unk> <unk> okay and a leader that morning kate called me at work and in omaha and i'm like <unk> are you going to make this really hard on me she's like we just want you to think about <unk> new thing and the job is supposed to be a a two year commitment uh-huh but and that was kind of like one of the things that i'm thinking i don't know about doing a two year commitment and you know all that sort of state to longer than it well sure no i mean it could be longer so it's not like it was too short who's just right you know i don't know i don't know what i was thinking but anyway so they're like what if it was just a one year commitment and some little think about it kinda threw me off and then i i called later in the director is um [noise] i said well would you be willing to uh first year i'm area director makes seventeen thousand <unk> second year area director makes eighteen thousand five hundred first year you get three weeks vacation second year you get four weeks and i said well would you be willing to hire me as if i was coming into the second year i'm at eighteen five with four weeks of vacation and he said yeah he he would be willing to do that wow that's a lot of vacation yeah it is which is wonderful [laughter] great <unk> much more important to me the money right yeah so we take we get the whole week from <unk> christmas new that's one of our weeks of vacation so it don't <unk> you know in addition to that so so anyway and the rest you can take pretty much <unk> when you want <unk> could <unk> yeah you gotta work during the schedule which is in you know <unk> not a really good time to take it because you're ending one year and starting the next year and you know doing a lot with the <unk> the volunteers coming <unk> i'll probably try to take most of the before next summer was <unk> <unk> so i i thought about that day and ended up pulling back and think okay i'm coming to detroit so it's been really good since i am actually i made the decision i thought oh god what am i doing you know i'm i just was still unsure about it but within a couple of days i just felt really at peace with it and remain so throughout the time that i prepared to leave and then ever since i've been here i keep thinking okay why am i so okay with this i'm going to be falling apart any minute right you know [laughter] 'cause i used to transition hitting me a little bit harder especially right now <unk> what about the decision but um i don't know it's been great so yeah i don't question it yeah that's what they said finally i'm i'm telling somebody who's like well how you doing <unk> well i i'm fine and you know i keep wondering [laughter] what's wrong and then finally i'm like you know i'm just going to be okay that i'm okay and if i'm not okay later that's fine but right now i'm okay i have to stop wondering what's going to [laughter] so so that's kind of word then [laughter] so tell me about new york i got your postcard oh new york was <unk> was really fun um i i love the city it was yeah i don't know i didn't expect to enjoy the city so much she had been there before though hadn't you know just really briefly i went to long island for a friend's wedding and kate katie and i my from oregon went together and we we took a train into the city a cab to metropolitan museum of art ran around there for an hour and a half typical back and then the train back to long island <unk> that all we saw um and i like that but it just didn't even feel like i had actually been in the city you know <unk> so um [noise] so this was more like you know if we did a lot of the the touristy stuff and watching the brooklyn bridge and <unk> to the ferry and i'm watching central park and went to a show and all that sort of stuff so it was really fun um and we also went out to long island where joe's mom lives uh-huh and spend time with the host family [laughter] so [laughter] which was okay it was good it first when we were planning the trip he he's like oh i hope we can go out and you know go to the beach and you can meet my my brother and my nieces and nephew he's got four brothers three brothers and two of them live on long island you know my brothers my nieces and nephews and i'm like i'm i don't know i don't i said i i think maybe we need time just to kinda figure out where our relationship is mhm it's not that i don't wanna be your family it's just i don't know a lot and mom too and i think she's a little bit leery of this whole relationship based on what happened in the past you know <unk> and i heard her son and all that sort of thing and like i just don't know if i'm ready for that and so but it it <unk> ended up happening that it was his brother's birthday and we were out there to go to the beach and so i'm like okay we can you can handle this and it was very nice actually so that was fine and uh so where did things end up oh i don't know <unk> um it was really fun and i mean in some ways joe somebody i've known a long time and and know pretty well but in other ways of like this is a whole new relationship mhm so it's it's kind of weird to walk that balance like <unk> you know one minute we're talking seriously like where would we live if we wanted to be together and <unk> you know i'm like wait a minute i can't believe we're talking about this <unk> doing now he's in his last year of graduate school at columbia university it's getting his masters in public administration uh-huh and he's been working with this man who's starting a new nonprofit organization um he worked with him last summer and this summer and probably will work with him during the school year beyond that he doesn't know what he's going to do you know but it's you know it's kinda hard because <unk> open he might want <unk> mean chances are really good that he'll want to stay in new york or at least on the east coast you know right kind of interest in politics to d._c. with the option and i don't know it's just hard because that's not really [laughter] where i'm at but i mean we're both sort of like we don't know her life is taking us and car just started relationship when yeah so what do we do you know do we make decisions based on each other i mean it's just the second we can resolve seen each other so he's coming here over labor day weekend and then because my schedule gets so crazy starting middle middle of october i'm going to go go there the first week of october that was kind of hard for us to decide you know he hasn't even been here yet i haven't seen him since fourth of july weekend and and we decided well you know how it goes but how do you plan that if you don't know how it's going to go exactly i'm like well i want i wanted to wait until after labor day to make the next step i said let me the other hand there's a fair we're going on right now and this is the only weekend that i have been till after thanksgiving you know and i write like if we're gonna try to do this i i don't think i could go from labor day until december you know <unk> he makes sense to me and he's like yeah okay well let's let's do it and i was it was weird you know i felt bad even bringing it up because i was doing the county thinking oh my god you know [laughter] so so we talk on the you know you come so i mean that's exciting <unk> it'll and in a way it's good i mean that you are both at stages while i mean you just kind of took <unk> know you ended up taking on a one year commitment right yeah and i think that was part of my thing was minister when they're going to do this two years long distance ugh right hate him and i hate the one you think <unk> for that [laughter] but now that i'm here i'm like i don't want to do it for just one year so i don't know what's gonna happen <unk> really excited for me to do this job but on the other hand he seems a little apprehensive like i think he knows i'm going to get here and love it and be like write said all right so i don't know i'm just i'm <unk> the <unk> the phone calls are okay but i just feel like what are we doing and i'm really anxious for him to get here um two weeks and it just seems more real more able to be together and talk about things and <unk> course you know the state of the face yeah so i think we're both <unk> sort of feeling like is this real what are we doing and so i'm i don't know that i don't know what's happening but i've been at least there's a prospect i mean it's <unk> biting yeah but <unk> don't feel like all my hopes are tied up in that and that's good you know right i mean i'm happy <unk> and other things in my life are good so good i'm glad what about you and the secret policemen [laughter] oh gosh well that's nice what happened was married and he his wife just had a baby like like two weeks ago or something [noise] wow it's been really hard on me because i just you know i have so many ideals and principals and everything and it was like <unk> everything just went out the window when this all happened because when i met him i really i didn't know he was married i think i told you you said you liked him but you didn't know that much about him and right and <unk> went out a couple of times and like the second time it wasn't until the second time that i found out that he was married and he's still didn't tell me that his actually at that time his wife is pregnant and he didn't tell me but he said a lot of things to me that you know like an eight year she'd never been tempted before and he didn't understand what <unk> was really attractive and all this kinda stuff and i always feel like there's no way i'm getting involved with a married man but i still had feelings for him and i thought that they would just die once i got the information that he was really married you know because i think i told her i suspected right but i wasn't sure and when i finally found out it was like oh and he was like well i really want us to be able to be friends you know i have a feeling that there will always be this like attraction and that might be better sweet but you know if we can get beyond that i think it would be really good friends friends and i'm like <unk> handed hard with it you know once you have i think once you're attracted to somebody in a certain way from the beginning <unk> awfully hard to go back backtrack especially being <unk> admitted between both of you exactly and so i'm trying to think what do you and i hadn't been hot about it for about a week and then she called me again and said well you know have lunch and so we had lunch and talked and it was still really there was still like a lot of money that they things mean compliment knee and kind of alert you know and that was still there and so i was very comfortable with it when he went to drop me off you took my hand like to take my hand but it kind of held onto it mhm and made me really uncomfortable and so he was like well i'll leave it up to you you know getting a call if you want to go out and have a drink or something like that you know whatever i didn't call and i just felt too with like uncomfortable and gonna be weird so two weeks after that which was just this past week um became dinner <unk> for something and he called me from inside the building they were doing some already <unk> like that yeah it's like i just you know call to say hi and like you know that i was here and when you think i was nor ignoring you or whatever and i'm like okay well that's you know and you could buy that night i went to do some shopping and if i'm walking home my apartment all of a sudden i see this <unk> him and he was like wild you know coincidence i just saw you walking and i decided to you know he's like i was on my way home and i'm like walking and you know and he was like well you didn't call i wondered if you just didn't watch any any more i thought maybe at least you just call they tell me that and anyway i hadn't hands off a little grocery so i'm like okay well let me go upstairs and put my groceries down and then you know we still have a drink whatever and talk about this 'cause i had been through a lotta strange feelings about it and you know i thought well maybe we can talk about it total mistake he comes up to my apartment with me and he's like well you know have a glass of water like that here and i'm just gonna stay for a couple of minutes 'cause i was on my way home well one thing turns into another <unk> calling my hand she misses me it was awful angie nice it was like commenting i still i'm such a jerk i mean i i feel like i committed adultery i mean nothing happened i mean we test but that was it but i feel so guilty and horrible and here this conversation is being taped and i'll probably tracked me though [laughter] i mean i don't know [laughter] [laughter] oh was awful and i've been getting myself up about it ever since i'm anyway so he finally left and i mean i think it was kinda hard for him <unk> i don't know what i'm saying but then a couple of days later i actually was the next day he called me and he's like um you know i think we need to talk about this came to meet you <unk> you know nothing happened nothing physical whatever we boxing folk kinda came to the conclusion that we would probably be too difficult for us to be friends or you know at least if we were going to we needed a long break and the sad thing is i mean we have the best conversations we just talk and talk and talk it's not just you know physical <unk> call and i i really would love to have him as a friend since i had those feelings and then i kinda got all caught up in it right then had to hurtful feelings like like with a break up or something you know what i mean that i think it's better if we just like oh yeah totally yeah oh anyway it's been that was one day <unk> thursday class wow and i know i'm going to be seeing him from time to time at work and that's gonna make things a little bit uncomfortable i just feel like stuck here and i know it's like things are so white and black so you're putting this situation you know what i mean oh yeah and <unk> and i know easy to say i just assumed that all my <unk> once i found out that he was really married i thought oh okay fine you know hands off like that's usually how it is right but that was weird i still had feelings for him and <unk> so hard for me to i mean here i haven't been interested in anybody <unk> <unk> and that's so hard for me to get over that of course the first person that interest that i'm you know that i feel something for <unk> hard to just walk away from it you know what i made her not to have any feelings about it i feel like i'm just fine my now but anyway [laughter] in any way like you pursued him <unk> him or anything i mean i i hope you can turn out to yeah too much because i mean i feel good about that but in a way angie i mean he was the one that last i mean he he really good struggled struggled with that i could tell but he was the one that got up to leave and i'm not sure that i would have i mean i wish i had insisted more like when it first happened when he when he put my hand and it started getting more you know kind of tender i should've just said look <unk> <unk> when you need to leave now and i wouldn't want to do it he was the one that got up and walk away and i i just feel guilty about that like i heard i mean it's it's hard when you have <unk> someone in the in the lines did she get blurred you know and and they're being tender towards do but that was he's the one i like i was so strong because the first week after you know the first time in the car when <unk> see how my hand and said well i'll leave it up to you you decide if you wanna call mhm the first week after that was really hard for me because i was tempted you know i'm like <unk> can i try to make a friendship work it's really nice guy really like you know but i just it's just so wrong and i knew it was gonna end up yeah something was going to happen i can tell you how <unk> looking at me i could tell by a lot of things and so i got past that first week you know and then the second week i've thought about um a little bit but it was getting better i was getting over it and i was i'm forgetting i'm you know <unk> many called the weirdest thing was i had dreamed about him the night before he called me at work that day i had no idea what's going to be there i had was weird really weird i dreamed about him and one of those dreams where it's like really strong yeah and it's weird it reminds me of that i dreamed about basketball one time before you call <unk> like i hadn't heard about him <unk> i don't know i just met this [laughter] a a lady that i work with her husband is really into like um a cold stuff but like i'm meeting with a dead <unk> with people that are dead <unk> was really interests but anyway we went out with them <unk> talked about it they decided that i have a i'm receptive you <unk> could be a medium [laughter] are you going to try <unk> now kind of freaks me out but anyway but now it's weird sometimes i have dreams and they're like premonition yeah right but it could just be that it was on my mind you know so i don't know i think there's more to the way we're all connected than than we admitted our daily lives and sometimes are so conscious takes care of it you know yeah i think that's true i think there's a lot that we have subconsciously that we don't like you said in daily life britain realized right and it comes out but anyway but now i don't know it's like basically we said goodbye and you know you think it was a total coincidence that he was driving by i'm not sure <unk> wondered about that when you said i'm really not sure but see the strange thing is he couldn't have known i i did grow i went to or on the way home that wasn't like i mean he could guess that i finished at five fifteen but he has no way of really knowing when i leave the office and then i went and did some shopping and it was like twenty to seven <unk> i mean it's you had to you would have had it in like things are going <unk> my apartment staking and the way he drove up it was like he was driving down the street he wasn't parked in front of my apartment you know what i mean uh-huh but then again i mean i'm sure he just got <unk> him so he could plan himself somewhere [laughter] and it was weird because i had seen him at work that day i mean i didn't see him but he called me from inside the building and you know it was like he was he had to be thinking about me you know what i mean right that's very strange i don't know i feel so guilty about his situation do you know what i mean 'cause i don't have anything to lose and right i mean he had he obviously has a lot one of the people involved it's very tiny percent and i just ah like this'll this'll be the end i mean do you have a sense that you could reach some like i feel like i know that i could call him and i've been really tempted i mean even like friday oh gosh like call and i feel i want to talk to him you know what i'm like making deals with myself i'm like well if we just talk on the phone and we don't see each other maybe we can do that and you know then started i started <unk> that means that outright close it you know is this is first child yeah and that's what one of the conversation that we had was um before this incident happened in my apartment but was nice that you know i i don't want you to take the wrong way but i think that a lot of this has to do with the fact that you're just going through a lot of changes in your life having a child i mean that's gotta be wow and i mean i could say this but i kind of in any way to that but i'm sure you hadn't had sex with his wife and you know months and so that might be like a factor i mean you know i think it was the timing and well and there's and he was like no no no that's not true i respect the way <unk> much thought you you know here you say that i don't but then i think later he realized that that had to be part of it is true i mean it doesn't say anything about you i mean you're still an attractive person someone that's they might not <unk> him another time and place but circumstances maybe made him more open to letting his mind go with this exactly time because i mean i i really oh i don't know i think maybe we talk rented typical when i'm in my cynical [laughter] i'm like oh he's just a difficult french you know whatever 'cause i was the one that <unk> he was married he never told me i asked the question so it was like what he had told me you know when <unk> told me what if i would've and i mean he admitted he's like yeah i guess i just wanted to know spend some time with you and get to know you and i wasn't thinking about you know by marriage or whatever talking to you about that because it didn't seem like it fit into what i want i want i think he kind of wanted to keep it for themselves you know what i mean like when you find a new friend or you meet somebody that you're kind of interested in and maybe you had these feelings didn't understand why he was interested in me and so he just decided well if i tell her i'm married and i share off yeah that's that's <unk> but i think it can be dangerous you know i think it's very dangerous that's why <unk> god richmond not we're rings gig know doesn't want <unk> <unk> it's not all frenchmen i mean [laughter] says it's work <unk> doesn't work for work but i think it's targeted because that's the thing i'm <unk> i mean i do kind of have some hostility towards him in a way because i think if i had seen a wedding ring on him and the very beginning i would never have you know the largest one of the top right there yeah a lot of my feelings to go any further because i would have been totally <unk> i know um so i mean it's just really upset me 'cause i'm like this cruel joke that god is playing on me the first person that i even soda any <unk> any interest in box out and on available yeah yeah hard and i feel so guilty but it just i think i'm gonna let it go and you don't have any reason to be guilty at all i think that you trade your best and i mean okay maybe a hundred percent perfectly strong and <unk> totally pure person wouldn't you know i don't know him and you were <unk> so weak i mean seriously if he would have <unk> off on me i'm not sure i would have stopped them and that's what scares the hell outta me i know how that is i mean i know that feeling come they would have regretted it so much i mean if i'm regretting it this much now for you know just citizen imagine if i were that my god yeah <unk> and you didn't i mean that's good yeah but not necessarily because of me i don't know if i would have been strong enough but then sometimes i think if it would have gone much further <unk> guy couldn't <unk> i mean because they told me i guess i would have been <unk> yeah i think so too i mean and probably what you're feeling now it's like well there was the desire in me when he gives me or were you know write that whatever but i think there would have come a point when you been like even with the desire and attraction i can't do this right i don't know i'll never know 'cause i was when i don't know but before before i found this last time after the first time you know when we had lunch my hand and everything she said well maybe i'm i said to him you know maybe this would be easier for me 'cause i admitted that it was difficult that i when i found out he was married that i thought you know all these feelings would go away and it really happened that way and he was saying the exact same thing to me and like really really struggled with us and <unk> and after i had no my wife had her babies like i just didn't know that i'd three or four days where i was so confused and so torments

and talk so what's the object of this it's part of a study for the linguistics party a department at the university of pennsylvania or they're just studying the american english usage so tell me about your peaches what happened with them well they were too heavy <unk> putting one bag so the orchard put them in two bags one with the handle she know shopping baton and one was a regular round back from the grocery store and we sit them in the laundry room <unk> well the first back i did that i put on the dining room table ah so they could raping overnight and yesterday i said well we gotta get these peaches done and get them bring me the other bag and he picked up the bag and he had the bag and no peaches they all right it didn't bottom all day and they were hardest rocks at they before and here they <unk> and also out <unk> teach juice and smash peaches all over the floor rather yeah what a mess so what did you do with them when we had to throw them out the bottom part of the top part we have frozen something like ten <unk> peaches that i find you can <unk> and when you take them out of the free <unk> just like eating fresh peaches which i didn't know and i froze one bag full of hand <unk> to make aunt annie's peach cake mhm in the winter several see what happens i made a wonderful peach thing last week um you know the recipe book that jane gave me yeah christmas time from deserts from your bread maker yeah well you make the dough and you leave it in the bread maker until it goes through a couple of cycles of <unk> meeting and raising and all that kind of stuff and then you take it out before bakes any divided into two and let it sit for a few minutes and then precedents like around um pizza pan <unk> and then i put now the kids had picked berries along the road um ah raspberries blackberries and huckleberries so i made one with uh that on it and the other end i sliced peaches real thin and then you put cinnamon sugar and and melted butter on the top and bake it of course it's a real you know it's a yeast dough <unk> ah it's a real good dough and boy they were and it it tells you the recipe actually calls for some kind of the um on it it says either unflavored whipped cream or a sour cream something like that well we just used cool whip and it was it was very good <unk> i took want to go to the guy across the road who cut the grass for <unk> while we were way mhm and um i enjoy it i have no idea um as a matter of fact i keep meaning to ask them and we've <unk> we've talked on several occasions they kind of paved our rude this week oh um [noise] what do you mean kind of well yeah the new people have been after about the potholes and dust and everything else you know and she goes down there on a regular basis and and raises a fuss mhm and um they finally said well that they'd be out and they they um [noise] oh i don't know it was ah they it it just keeps getting pushed back and back well finally they came out i think monday ah well no actually when we came home we noticed that they'd shaved some some of the uh swale off across the road now they still have not fixed that pipe which is my big complaint the whole time <unk> still hanging up in the air and everhart beside himself because we asked them to sink that pipe so that people wouldn't get their tires cut on it you know <unk> well they never <unk> they didn't do that but um [noise] what they did what well now let me see first monday they turned off the water here all ah all morning on monday because the pipe had sprung the week that they had to fix that before they could do the road then they came down tuesday and they did all this preparation work they dug they put a pipe i'm sort of [noise] caddywampus under under the road just below our driveway and before the new peoples' driveway but the way they put it in mother and loved it it blocked our pipe so that anything that would have gone through our pipe would've backed up and media cuddly and and flooded our property [noise] kinda engineers do they have working down there <unk> everhart said he doesn't think they have any idea at all you know well i went up to help 'em the band people help fit band uniforms yeah now you know the my day we got our uniforms fit but there weren't parents around you know this is all done by the parents <unk> um so i went up to help and i got there at eight o'clock and around eleven i called home and everhart was beside himself a you know as soon as the kids told them it was me he told them to tell her <unk> that they made a colossal mess out on the roof and um so i said the virginia i've gotta go i've got to go see what's wrong well they <unk> they don't this deep trench and put these huge rocks in the road now when i back out i have to be careful that i don't go into the ditch across the road where these great big huge rocks are <unk> um you know i i can't i just can't even begin to tell you well at any rate they got all that done and then they came along and what they're buying now is stuff called well it's crushed asphalt it's recycled road basically and um they told us that [noise] it's it's a holds up better than the stone that they'd been putting on and it also um well it's it's so delightful to come down the road and not be followed by a cloud of dust you know but they put it all on and smoothed that they they came down with a great big heavy rollers and all that kind of stuff and um it it actually looks like road out there so uh uh [noise] i'm pleased about that you know the way they did the other stuff and i said to him i said everhart it's not <unk> they did come back and dig out our ditch <unk> fill our ditch with <unk> two great big soon and i said everhart just don't get upset about it because if the lot next to us ever gets built on they're gonna have to come back and do it again because there's no place it's this the pipe that they put in will pour water right into this <unk> person's front yard <unk> um you know and and i said i i can't help it that they do things in such a dumb way that's you know it's it's very annoying it's very frustrating especially when you're paying for the privilege of having them making that you know there there was a terrible accident down here last night terrible i'm up here um you know on the highway when you come down and route two and four join up there you know um apparently uh to tour bus was coming down from annapolis never stopped there and hit a car travelling north head on and uh andrew's coach said today that they brought two i'm dead to the hospital and at least seventeen from the tour bus in serious condition <unk> must have been a terrible terrible thing <unk> why listen if we come up yeah we're not on labor day weekend yeah do you want me to make a reservation that the quality well when would you be coming up probably saturday uh as of right now andrew has practice on friday and karen has it's saturday morning well if you come up saturday you'll only be here what saturday and sunday night right right and we won't be here at three o'clock in the afternoon <unk> reception mhm now i don't think it's going to be that late you know because it's out in the yard uh-huh so you know i i don't know why it wouldn't be all right to stay here all right well we got this thing i'm one of the places that we stayed in and i think it might have been the the one in new jersey um where there's a special rate that qualities are tom for you know what i'm yeah and i said everhart i may just give him a call and see what it is you know and that way if it's a if it's not real expensive and we're not invited on sunday then we could swim you know <unk> um you don't think we will ever it's saturday oh it's saturday yeah saturday three o'clock in the

maryland um wind by the the <unk> oh yeah yeah and uh you know that's what they're going to have and of course there's people coming from philadelphia so i just don't imagine it's gonna be that late right but it would be saturday and you wouldn't be here ah well whatever time to get here you certainly can have something to eat and uh sunday we can swim in the one that would be fine okay yeah so my birthday you know yeah well <unk> maybe i'll even bake yeah okay <unk> i i don't suspect anybody here will man i'm trying to get all this stuff wrapped up i got a call 'em you know i told you that there was a job that i was interested in within the school district yeah but you didn't get it and i i didn't even get a chance at it because they they did something crazy you know well um my friend called me the other day and said hey ah across my desk came that announcement again it's open and i said you've got to be kidding me i was told that it was all but wrapped up well here what they did they changed it uh in an attempt i get i don't know why but it was supposed to be a director's position and it was offering you know pretty decent money and it's the same because it's an employee's daycare center i'm it's only a ten month position as well you know <unk> well then they change it they wanted a an assistant a person running in and an assistant so they basically split the salary and half you know <unk> well the girl that had applied for it told them forget it she wasn't interested under those terms so they put it they opened it back up again well i called the other day to hear what it was about and um i was told not to cole personnel but to call the supervisor directly because i know her and she wasn't around but i talked to her secretary and they she said oh please you know you have to in writing down here put in a letter of interest well i cause she transferred me to personnel and they told me what the salary was and it would be she's the woman did say i don't know what they'd bring you on with because of your experience but you know she told me what the starting salary was and it would be a big draw for me and i can't do that you know you can and ah i i who than <unk> and tried to decide whether to put the letter in any way or not and <unk> decided not to be <unk> cause i couldn't justify that big a job you know now yeah and then we'd go swimming on friday and come home and there was a call from the supervisor telling me how delighted she is alive expressed interest and she hopes that the letter that <unk> that i got the letter off the personnel because she'd be going in first thing monday to set up interviews so i figure well you know and i quick type a letter and took it up and faxed it and uh so that it's there <unk> didn't quite get there for clues business but it there when they get there monday morning and i will call her tomorrow morning first thing and let her know and i can always listen to what they say and if it's not right you know say no thank you say no thank you right exactly so and i also um that that was that i'm working on some other ones that have to do several federal employment you know <unk> and trying to match my experience then the you know put it into some boxes sort of thing but at any rate um we finally uh you know we had contacted around this time last year we contacted a lawyer who's name we saw on the test or no regard the social security disability yeah we had conversation back and forth with him several times and and in the end decided of course to go ahead and <unk> on our on our room well um i let him knows what the outcome was <unk> and uh he wrote a real nice letter and sent a handful of business cards just in case you know and uh let us know what else he does and one of the things that he says he does is federal workman's comp so i finally got around to <unk> well i called him a number of times when i finally got around to talking to him and i i just can't believe that mother i don't know whether it's because you know whether it's because he makes a lot of money or because it's just not he told me that it it wouldn't be worth it for him to take the case <unk> on under any circumstances but he said he things that we should think long and hard about what the outcome will be because he doesn't see that um it would make that much difference between what were receiving from social security and um the retirement and what would be offered from the department of labor and in our circumstances it would almost double the the new <unk> that we're getting right now and so i don't even understand how he how he figures you know whether <unk> means that the the fees to small or whether he makes so much money that that much money and <unk> doesn't mean anything to him i don't know but he was he was very a very short with me uh he has been very nice i mean i in fact um barbecue chicken said she used him or his for <unk> for one of the er just one of the cases that they had with 'em i duck sai accident or something like that but i don't know i don't so i said are you telling me that we shouldn't even go to the hearing you said well if you're planning on going he said you know go to it buddies that i don't see that <unk> that it's going to bring anything and i said well you know maybe just a disturb because you went ahead and <unk> you know what <unk> that's what i said everhart later after i thought about it i said you know maybe he doesn't want to bother because we went ahead without him and were successful and <unk> you know if we'd been successful we would have <unk> had to pay quite a bit of money to him you know <unk> uh i mean i i'll be honest i think we were going to be successful one way or the other <unk> yeah but um that's what i said to them or i did you get 'em to talk to jayne i talk to her through the week um i haven't talked to her since uh she had a great up there for the week yeah i knew she was having company and um the girls are away <unk> was in kentucky i i didn't ask her and <unk> i mean when <unk> that i knew rosemary went to uh kentucky with mary was gonna fly home and then she's in a couple of races and <unk> was in

and of course i can't better saying that than anything else you know well i can't uh i you couldn't imagine what he said yeah uh the testicle is twenty five percent or was twenty five percent larger than it should be and as of yesterday it was a hundred percent larger <unk> and very very painful <unk> and i talk to darcy yesterday o. n. n. m. e. as evidently she had many many strokes and now

uh-huh you know isabel mess huh yes she contacted me and everything i have to tell you about that but anyway i just wanted to wish you happy that day is today you're <unk> date is mine <unk> mine too well <unk> isn't that great let's see it must it's thirty four years for me so it must be thirty six for you already six and i couldn't today was 'cause i didn't mention it yet today i should when i go back to the house to these two young <unk> gal <unk> um because uh one of them wasn't feeling well today and everything well anyway i didn't mention and i was off early this morning like four thirty in the morning we got up because i don't know if you didn't know donald ward astray now he's um from the maryland province but he's been i'm down in chile for a while long time and on his way back to the states he stopped off <unk> the ass <unk> which was really nice so but today he had to you know be in the airport at six a._m. oh we were you know we've had kind of an unusual day begin [laughter] i haven't mentioned to anybody about <unk> and everything but let me just tell you a little bit about isabel and i'll write because she called and at that point she didn't mail made <unk> your letter you know she could've mail that but she um way didn't want to give it to me personally but so i didn't know who she was you know because i didn't read your letter because i didn't have <unk> but anyway she explained that she had <unk> you with the centering prayer retreat mhm and ah she invited us over to her home and it's a very nice you know she's kinda from the wealthy class you know <unk> and so her she has a lovely home and she has a swimming pool and um you know we had a really nice day we went <unk> you know we got there around eleven o'clock in the morning and we stayed till about three or four oh in the afternoon and she's such an interesting person you know and in fact she said that we could go back there to her house 'cause it's like going to a retreat house oh place you know it's like really getting away and it's just very lovely mhm so you know she said she could share the centering prayer you know with us mhm that would be really nice oh she said maybe she told you this that her daughter from france was coming over for a month notice you didn't <unk> most of the time yes she said that she only got to talk to your little bit because of the kitchen duty and i was i mean we're <unk> we were signed up to do the same day although we worked together painting the kitchen okay and then she said she didn't know how to do something and then she asked you and you said well i didn't know either [laughter] she felt a lot better at it here and there was an american who didn't know what we're supposed to be done either <unk> but anyway um she um you know her daughter from france is over for a month and she said now after that i'm going to be able to you know call you again that for the next month i'm really you know with my daughter here and her husband and i don't know if they have children or what yeah mhm <unk> oh yeah so she said we'll get together in another month or so but we were talking about you know the possibly maybe going to her house for retreat or something but she loved the retreat now it's interesting 'cause she's charismatic she said that she was in the carriage nettie movement and i don't know she still active with that or not yeah but there came a point when i guess father keating had come on to the dominican republic once or twice and she went to hear him owe and they're just came <unk> point when somehow there was adept to the centering prayer that she found herself wanting yes yeah and so she seems very in fact i think she's a representative from the dominican republic to the centering prayer leadership okay <unk> well i was um you know very impressed with her and i mean the fact that you would make that trip up and all that i mean i know they have the means to do it but still it's quite <unk> something <unk> and uh but she said they have a prayer group fifteen couples and i said to her <unk> she said oh yes you said it's very good and it's not just women you know fifteen men and fifteen women and they're really good and everything so i just wanted to you know kind of thank you for that because that was <unk> it's really a nice contact it's and it's kind of an escape once in awhile good to go over there uh-huh because like now we've been we just got the lights back the electricity back about a half an hour ago oh we've had four days you know like without any light <unk> and um which is fine during the day but usually what they have here is um the light goes off on and off during the day you never know when it's going to be a north but we haven't had it now for four days <unk> know like our refrigerator isn't going and food goes bad and all that so um you know she said she she doesn't have that that much although can you hear that motorcycle yeah back but it's not <unk> i'm you know i can hear you too yeah okay [laughter] that that's what goes on here all the time the big motor cyclists and now you're gonna come again they they love to show i don't know the power or something like that and i don't know but um so i'm <unk> i i just wanted to say one of them a little list here because i thought our time is gonna run out <unk> and and <unk> you you might have something stupid i just want us to say this about don ward the one who is just here visiting the jesuit mhm so he was saying to me now enjoy you have to go home now you have to go back to the states and publicize this i mean you're never going to get people coming down here and i said well there are people working on this home we have a responsibility office and we have a development office and you know i said that he said no it's not the same they haven't been here they haven't been here and so he said you should go home and you talk <unk> talk about with your sisters talk about <unk> and all that well i mean i'm not going home i i you know <unk> my job is to stay here and i i'm planning to go home for whatever we have is it a big assembly like in july or so christology workshop yeah i mean a long weekend okay so um i hope to go home for that but he was saying <unk> this is the way i you know you talk <unk> and not only just to raise funds for to get more applicants down here and all that and i said well you know we're not looking for a lot of applicants we were planning on starting with for that we had thought the <unk> the maximum will before and we had for up until about three weeks before i left the states to come here and that was <unk> one of the chileans backed out and i thought it meant that the other one would back out to you know because <unk> wasn't going to come along but she didn't and then one of the americans um that i thought it was in the bag everything she <unk> she's working with the jesuit volunteers and you know <unk> thought my god this wonderful well she did not get a good recommendation from the jesuit volunteer coordinator so you know i just thank god we did really look into her reference his you know but i was so sure that some of our sisters newer and you know i just said oh this okay here's our fourth member but anyway so we have to we have one chilean and one american they're both very fine like but anyway what i'm getting at is i was mentioning to jon ward i'm about isabel mess huh you know i was just telling them a little bit and i told him that you know there's a series of free phone calls now and i've been able to talk to different people from the society you know and i told them you were calling and he said well now whereas <unk> what's his roseanne too and i said well she works at the she's at the college she's doing <unk> you know she's so he said well i'm saying he was talking to are one of our missionaries here and he said when people make up their mind about what they're gonna do next year you know because he had said to me you should go home and january talk this up and i said well she said oh about october <unk> i don't know that's true but anyway he said all and <unk> <unk> so then he said okay he said that i have lived 'cause he was here for a week with us mhm and he said i i'm going to go and talk this up now how can i get in touch with roseanne i said oh i can give your number and he said you know better still could she called me because they don't know she really wants to talk to me and i won't be bothering her so [laughter] so anyway um what he wants to do is like go over to rosemont he's going to be working in camden new jersey with <unk> spanish because i get jesuits have uh an option for the poor there in camden mhm [noise] so anyway his new assignment is is there although you know i'm working with <unk> jesuit movement down here well he was quite taken with it although he also saw a lot of the flaws in it and ah yeah but anyway he was quite taken it with it and the jesuit director of the program with quite taken with him so now you've got to come back promise where you're coming back and he said well i haven't even gotten home yet i haven't even started my new assignment yet and so he says i'm you know but you must come back here made for this place and all that so anyway he had a good week here he <unk> we had four days three and a half four days of torrential rain it was the end of some hurricane aren't know what's been you know rolling around cuba or something but anyway we we had that so we were trapped in the house with like really torrential rains it was just feeding down and so i thought oh this is it is a disaster i mean you can't go anywhere mhm we were going to go to the beach <unk> to the beach and and we were going to go to some of the places where they have <unk> um sugar cane workers you know <unk> all this stuff and we couldn't do it for the last three days <unk> week uh first four days just rain rain rain and then the last three days we we got around to the sail agree office we went to the haitian you know compliment to where they they live you know in great misery and so it was really good and he got to really know everybody in our neighborhood so he wants to give a description of what the missionaries would be doing and what their life is like <unk> um because you know he lived with us and that you know he he how well they're taking <unk> not having <unk> see they cut the water off every day and then usually you get at some point during the day and then <unk> it's during the point when you get the water everybody feels all these tubs and <unk> and <unk> so then you have all this water that you can bathe with her cook with or whatever so it's and then if the water comes on the next day that's okay you just fill him up again and you know and it's all right the only problem it's just once since i've been here and i haven't been here very long state um the water didn't come on for three days so then you're getting very very low and your cubs you know don't have any more water now he didn't he did not experienced that uh-huh um so anyway he said that he he would like to really talk this up now he is the person to do it he's got his great personality and um you know made friends with everybody everybody was crying we left gana last night we had little goodbye party from it was you'd think he'd been here for you [laughter] so i just wanted to <unk> so he said to me ah roseanne someone that you know without even knowing you roseanne the one i have to talk to and i and i said well another one you should talk to is jackie what two sick because she's the one through home the applications are filtered and she you know process them process them now now i'm down here i can't do anything about them and <unk> you should talk to her too and also ah richard come down i said to him and then so that you know what she's sending people too so he said well roseanne can roseanne a direct tomato jackie or can cheat you know i'll be on the same campus and i said oh i'm sure you know you just have to talk to her and um you know clarify what you want mhm so he said to him today rushing to the airport he said could rosie harm me after labor day so i said well you know i'll give her this message now you may be too busy for this i'm talking about after labor day or you may you know not feel comfortable but i think what he would like to do is come and talk to you and see is there any what's the word uh contacts that he could have <unk> some motivation 'cause he says it's your your own alumnae that you want your own girls who has your spirit those are the people you aren't here and all that and uh you know as i said you've got to go back and talk it out but i can't you know because i'm <unk> i'm trying to keep my head above water <unk> you know down here and make sure that these girls are doing well and they're happy and you know all that and how does that sound <unk> well i would be delighted to call him yes um we have a great great but there is a significant minority students on campus who are are interested in spanish speaking or who are spanish speaking yeah and <unk> also have an interest in some kind of social outreach yeah and is your speaking and i'm wondering about um the idea of my certainly calling him but also <unk> and who's the campus ministry <unk> yes great and maybe working out some kind of a deal where <unk> he comes and says uh sunday offers it's sunday evening litter g. o. and business with students before or after his he he would love that he would love that let me just tell you i don't know how <unk> time if i forget you bring my we have about ten more minutes okay just want to take last night we had a little math and now we have a lot of evangelical around us in where we did you know but they're just darling and you know these girls and they're singing all these <unk> well they didn't seem to want to go home when we were going to have a little math and living room mhm so of course he included them and he said now we're going to have evangelical we're going to sing you know and they they pick out the songs and they were all this gory to god and our louis and all those kinds of songs but they thing but at the moment if communion i just thought this was so lovely um he said now you girls you little girls are not accustomed to this <unk> and the way we do like you can help me and so he gave one of them the little dish with the bread and <unk> and she went around and i mean they weren't very many people that just mass there were two missionaries and myself and somebody else and some <unk> two other nuns where i am now i'm at their house too so but she went around to each one you know and they just <unk> piece of bread i thought that was so beautiful and then at the wind you know the <unk> precious blood and get the same for another one and she went around with this little grass for his blood <unk> with <unk> nice <unk> you know he's simple he's not a great intellectual and he's very intelligent man but he's he's missionary type uh-huh you know uh-huh that's a great idea roseanne <unk> let me give you his number okay okay uh-huh it's six oh nine six oh nine because it's camden nine six three six three one six to one one six to one and the fax just in case okay it's six oh nine six oh nine three three a's three three eight oh seven nine three oh seven nine <unk> he did say after labor day 'cause he just doesn't know where he's going to be this week and he said um then you wouldn't waste <unk> okay and then the other see and if you could then maybe with joanne and then <unk> at another point or connected with it i'm not sure how let him talk to jackie yes to jackie as i say is the one who sends people here <unk> and um i think he'll urge her to come and visit do and um i don't know it's jackie could ever either get her group of people too that <unk> that he would offer <unk> college or else maybe he would do a separate mass for her <unk> yeah because you know he's he doesn't know what he's doing <unk> he's working in the parish that's where you know so i think he you know they can work things out they have some time off and everything <unk> i'll try to be the sort of liaison person between him and these other two women who are in more direct contact with yeah didn't he would be interested in that and i might mention it to the spanish teacher as well great because she might and also one of their religion teachers now one of the things i just want to get you know i have to keep emphasizing this is like the face dimension when i first came here fairly <unk> said they were to represent the first one is that the service being rendered be done because of a commitment you christ mhm and um the jesuit who explained that to me he said this is nothing against other programs that are very very wonderful you know where they give service for service's sake but it's just that this thing is because of uh conversion are because of their friendship with christ <unk> wanting to collaborate with that project you know and and the second one is that you live in the same poor area where you're going to work now let me say that i have seen you know that just it's very i i i took it literally and <unk> you know i said jackie this is very important and we didn't take some people because of that <unk> you know in fact one jewish gal that she was just crazy about and was very very dynamic and knew spanish and everything but i said jackie how can we say she's doing this had of commitment to christ you know i mean i can't say that to fail agree and this is my favorite but i have also found that as an all things human it is it is not perfectly kept down here <unk> i mean i've met other volunteers for you know from spain and everything but i <unk> um but anyway i would like to still keep that <unk> and not change that with jackie and i think it might may be it would be important that people knew that mhm oh this is great well i mean it's great for me i'm i'm using your phone call here on divided oh great well just tell me a little bit about europe <unk> because you said you mean you're in your letter now pray for <unk> to do you mean with the girls well basically in the college yeah um but i do a couple of things that i wanted to be sure dimension to you yeah one is that um isabelle was one of four women who made this centering prayer retreat okay i read that sure in your letter okay and another one was named guadalupe otherwise known as lupita okay and apparently she sometimes she teaches about third grade maybe yeah and sometimes she brings the children to this fail a gray area where you are oh okay so you may meet her oh okay now <unk> and she's called lupita lupita yeah okay now at the end of the retreat we had a little sharing session yes and she began to speak and she became a little bit emotional yeah and she said she really wished she could talk more about her experience but she couldn't because she was more comfortable in spanish yeah okay and so when i say goodbye to her and everything i you know <unk> she <unk> she would be meeting you at some time <unk> okay and i told her i didn't i wasn't setting you up to be a spiritual director anything [laughter] but i did say <unk> that she we're to talk if she felt that she wanted to talk about her parish experience in spanish that you would probably be able to certainly to understand it but to emphasize a little bit with what you <unk> yeah yeah so i wanted to tell you that i said that okay now do do do you give me her number in that letter i don't think so no okay but isabelle would know it 'cause they went heather yeah okay <unk> and she seems to uh i think maybe when the school year starts for something <unk> will be up there with her students doing a service project or i don't know just <unk> that they do yeah okay <unk> <unk> there are many say yeah like <unk> centers <unk> always possible that she works in one and not the one i am and but <unk> but the thing is with isabelle i can get in touch with her uh-huh yeah uh-huh so that's fine <unk> yeah then the other thing that you mentioned to you is um with respect to my niece and my nephew yeah my nephew's name is jeff mcdougal yeah he made his vows and the jesuits a year ago you said that i i couldn't remember if i did or not and so he spent a a portion of the summer in mexico yeah and then went to el salvador after he finished his summer school courses okay now i don't know if he will come back again i have a feeling he will probably spend a good portion of his life somewhere in in one of the central yeah <unk> south american countries yes but if you should meet him i know you'll keep an eye on him or oh yeah no kidding yeah jeff mcdougal uh-huh that's neat uh-huh yeah and then my niece anne i'm maybe you won't meet her because even though she's raised catholic and all that yeah right now she doesn't want to associate herself with any kind of a religious service project although she's very interested in something like what you're doing yeah yeah um so we'll see what happens on now where is she living she right now she's in portland okay okay <unk> and she's college age and she's been working but she's going to go to school but she's going <unk> i'm just a take courses in spanish and she kinda going through a conversion life changing experience yeah yeah and when <unk> when she's all done i mean i i know she's moving towards simpler lifestyle and the life of service and yeah how much god is going to be in the picture not made to be seen yeah and i have a lot of help for oh yeah yeah so i just was so happy when i and you know discovered that these ladies were from the same area where you are and yeah called peace and got the address and when they saw your address they said oh they wanted to meet you and give you a chance to meet some other people in the area so i'm really pleased about that oh that's yeah you know um i use it was really good and as i said as you said in your <unk> your letter to me you you saw possibilities you know just mhm for contacts and friendship mhm everything and um it you know it's <unk> it's it was really good and of course she teaches theology that was another <unk> i'm isabelle <unk> amazed at all the stuff that she was telling me she does uh-huh and um but very down to earth too and <unk> she gave us a lot about the culture of the country and it was very very worthwhile oh i'm delighted and everything i'm <unk> how are is there anybody you know very very sick or you know i always i pray for the <unk> like they say <unk> not well well she was up at the college today yeah she's not anything she's so determined <unk> okay yeah i got it i mean it's true she's not well but she certainly keeping going yeah okay and then annette they said had gone down a lot gone downhill i haven't heard anything about her recently yeah yeah yeah so through the knew i wanted to uh we had a little meeting last sunday to plan for the christology workshop next summer and yeah a lot of ideas were shared and and <unk> was annette there no no no no but it wouldn't group i'm about twenty two essay c._j. from the oh really oh yeah and of course saturday with the jubilees and they were over three hundred people in the chapel at rosemont and for dinner and <unk> was lovely it was just beautiful that's really become really nice tradition and the <unk> the jubilees and everything yeah that's when peggy called me that night oh <unk> that's right and and <unk> was telling me a little and i felt so bad i hadn't written some but i did get letters off <unk> notes off to them anyway <unk> with don good so yeah and that was that was so good the mail down here is terrible juno last week i went to the <unk> main office <unk> and i i i i don't know what point these letters came into the office but they had been sent out june seventeenth <unk> i mean you know it was more than two months to get here uh-huh thing here it's just very disorganized everything is disorganized that's why the lights are constantly going out and the the transportation is just <unk> but anyway he don ward lives through all of this and he loved it i mean he wants to come back and everything and when he finishes and then <unk> and camden well that's why isabel wanted to bring the letter <unk> cause she said you would be a long time before you get it otherwise yeah yeah and um and well anyway i wrote your little note you'll be oh nice through don ward oh and you know he brought them all own today <unk> so um but anyway how um how are things going into college with peg well you know she's worked very hard all summer and she's really taking every area and working from the ground up yeah really rebuilding and and she's only an interim isn't she well yes but i mean we're not we're right now we're just focusing on what has to be done right now and the kind of in the long range planning that we have to do in order to make what happens now happen she doing a good job <unk> marvelous oh i'm so bad i mean there's so much respect for her i have not heard one negative comment yeah well good oh than so i'm so mad so i think that if we're going to make it it's gonna be now yeah and if we're not it's going to be now but everybody's just giving everything to make it work yeah yeah we're hoping for the best yeah and how's the enrollment roseanne well it's not good yeah we have sixty freshman coming yeah and <unk> said not good that's correct that's correct last year we had eighty and we were very distressed to have all this and this year sixty yeah so uh anyway we're really doing our utmost to do some creative planning to reverse that trend for next year yeah so well aunt joyce it's been really nice to talk to you i we've gone over half hour <unk> old [laughter] and the last phone call they came in and out <unk> yeah that's what i was understood was going to happen well anyway maybe they're anyone happened but anyway you're just the idea to have taken your time to call me because it's it's <unk> big thrill for 'em to to our sisters really is so um i think you know we'll be in touch and you're kind of as you said my liaison now with with don ward well i'll be that and i guess you can be mine with four ladies <unk> lupita's that you know name down and yes isabel did say she wanted to get all them together but i you know now i have another reason for talking to this guadalupe you know mhm and um

4721-0000000-0000163 okay okay all right where their address [laughter] here we are coming to you live [laughter] louis beene [laughter] tell me exactly what are they going to do with this wonderful recording well the the deal is uh this friend of mine <unk> is a a computer science research or in the area of natural languages and so there's this research project that he's participating in and and that you know others you know around the country are doing and what they're doing is they're digitizing telephone conversations and they're going to try and extract as many samples of words spoken over a telephone as they can basically individual words they're probably not going to be transmitted the whole message in its entirety ever <unk> um because you know what four so the ideas to get a whole giant listing of the different ways that people can say the word say a execute the president of the united states for instance [laughter] the contract that kind of always controversial emory [laughter] i said that they could they could just pick out and see like the difference in like the tone like through through digital <unk> yeah <unk> exactly magic right yeah well that's very interesting though <unk> can like anybody get hooked into the service yes actually you can as long as it's basically the deal is they want people to record a native native american english speakers right um so yeah you can call 'em you know out of the country and within the united states and let me ask you something like <unk> my brother get into this program [laughter] i'm sure i mean the only really an hour but yeah sure yeah oh my god you got to give me information it because it's like <unk> <unk> my brother cost me like fairly frequently we try to keep it to a minimum but i mean i mean he's a chat face just like two hours later <unk> we'd better get off the phone [laughter] and then another fifteen minutes of phone conversation so this'll be nice 'cause he's got i mean he calls me and he's also got friends all over the state city closing his phone bills are huge my brother yeah i mean huge now the only thing that have my only got two calls so it's only three calls but i even said alison <unk> that's right and international our i know i know that's quite an expense yeah and it can be anywhere in the world too which is pretty wild i mean obviously it will be the spain but i mean there are way more expensive places to call them from the u._s. has been <unk> calling like do you have <unk> one destination and call anywhere <unk> mean i'm just calling you yeah yeah oh lord i don't feel special on just one second here <unk> <unk> because i'm going to lower the music tailed okay okay <unk> <unk> well <unk> music or hello there you are that are on the tape [laughter] that was good yeah it's [laughter] i wasn't listening to the boys i came back and i started talking [noise] how are you i'm okay i suppose yeah i mean one of these like periods of jeez life sucks you know in a little funk yeah that's pretty much all these i mean i don't hate my job as much as i did about a month ago that could be because of all the deadline such but um [noise] i just i won't be back in barcelona although i know that's not the answer i mean it was only good for the six months or so when we were there after school and i mean there are other good parts of the two of course but there were <unk> the hassles of the job there so it's like i just have to kind of reconcile myself to always heating work [laughter] yeah i like you find something that that isn't stressful or not boring that's the main two combinations right yeah not stressful and not boring you know like i have no problems with secretarial work okay that would fit into that category because if you're a busy enough secretary you know <unk> you don't get bored because you're always doing something different and if your employers are relatively decent human being you know to enter but you get no respect i'm you know you're a secretary and the pay is pretty pretty crummy it's about well pretty much the same as as what i'm getting now you know but um depending upon where you work and all but you know it's like that's no answer either so i've just been toying with this idea of going back to school and getting computer science degree so i can always be gainfully employed but anyway because at that pregnancy thing oh yeah that pregnancy thing yeah maybe that's what is your hormones calling yeah we'll know the funny thing is it's like ten years ago i would've said oh yeah that was what <unk> really wanted to be doing having a baby you know it's like at this point in time it's kinda like we're going to do it because if we don't do it you know and the next year or two we'd regret it you know we we figure something we'd want to do it's not like we're doing and we have to do it or there's peer pressure <unk> little little time <unk> no no [laughter] i i know exactly where you're at because i think about that too and it got about like six or seven years yeah i figure my body is a very slow i'm maturer you know what i mean like i get my periods was sixteen i don't look i mean i look like about at least five or six years younger than i actually am yeah and i'm just starting to get my period actually now the dog so i kinda figured well i'm <unk> i'm probably i'm probably good to at least some time in the early forties and i could probably go a little longer than that i know the risk and all that bullshit but um yeah i think about that too 'cause like i mean i i kinda liked the way things are going into <unk> total lack of responsibility kids are cute and all that and i was just we we slip till noon we got up about ten and like oh we have to get our bed played with the cats so back to sleep okay i mean we're talking total slackers and i thought gee you know if we had a kid we couldn't do this [laughter] you know and now you've got to be focused on that and i mean there's lots of other things that i mean as far as like living situation i feel kind of settled you know like i might be like traipsing around but i mean i could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe ten years <unk> even if i could project that far which i really can't but i mean you gotta kid you can't just like in ten years it's like i think i'll go to the orient and start like bouncing from country to country i know well i mean okay emory wants to get his doctorate so we'll know next spring if you can get at least accepted into the program which only you know and then then there's four or five years doing the damn work and [laughter] and he wants to that's fine he can do no problem [noise] but um that sort of ties up here although we like the place where no her to leave it and then <unk> good but then you know what if you could get a position overseas again which is something both of us has said we'll be pretty darn good because um you know we're at after after coming back from spain from the two and a half years <unk> it wasn't so much the just the way things were just asking the question gee we really like um the way things are over here with the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing i mean i'm really in the nine to five thing more so than he is he you know he should be there by you know let's say eight thirty nine but yeah well okay i'm in his professors obviously a great person to work for so i'm envious but um [noise] whatever i'm you know i'm caught up in it and and i don't like it [laughter] you know too many days i'm i'm working and and eating at my desk at about twelve o'clock and thinking this is crazy you know in spain uh we have is greek and you said you talk to people you know you enjoyed your food you relax you know and it's a fairly productive nation right you know [laughter] yeah yeah <unk> yeah i mean you have to like look at like both i mean they both have advantages and disadvantages what you have to do with concentrate on the advantages <unk> what other ever place you're end mhm and think about the disadvantages of the place that you're not and yeah i was you go nuts right that's true yeah yeah i know laura tried uh 'cause we have email and and so she sent me a little back saying you know remember how crowded the transportation <unk> and what else how expensive everything is and uh you know i remember those things and <unk> and you work you know possibilities were a lot more limited room and the language you know yeah constantly like kinda like i mean those could be considered positive things as well yeah but i mean you might as well think of them in a negative <unk> rather than just like well <unk> and that's why i i it helps to have kind of a glimpse into the future right and it's i don't know we got to spain and the first places we said we wanted to live abroad and we would try to do it you know as teachers and it turned out that way 'cause we had this idea of and i really feel that that is important and so when i'm having idea of now is okay you know emory works on his doctor it takes about five or six years we have the kid probably we he gets a research position somewhere in france or in spain um and then we move over there and you know i take care of the kid and and do some you know little day labor whatever you know we'll see [laughter] um and we have a relatively mellow life or who knows five or ten years and then we take it from there yeah 'cause even like you know i mean all that stuff <unk> israel <unk> subject to whatever change in the weather there happens today right well i know and and it's like you know what i think about <unk> i get like the same the same as you like some days it's just kinda like you know what the hell am i doing not not with my life but i mean just like what you know like what like what do i get the animal to to just you know to do anything you know that can just lay in bed and dreams that i know day he's like well i i know i know what you're saying i i feel there's sort of a a line to cross too between really planning it out and worry stressing over <unk> for a while a couple of months back there i was thinking in terms of oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house and then we sat down and sort of looked at financially and said this is what we really want to be worrying about right now and and <unk> and and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future i i know i have this tendency to do that and miss the president <unk> yeah i mean miss like you know the smell of the goddamn onions frying pan yeah you know and <unk> and each little i mean it's like <unk> <unk> as far as i'm concerned there's like no pleasure that's his ten is the one that you're experiencing at that moment you know you can think about <unk> something might be like a reminisce about the past like when you're there in that moment it's i mean everything else just kinda like it's almost like time doesn't exist yeah you know <unk> yeah i know one of the best moments i can recall and these past few months is okay i get to late to work a little bit late which is common and they don't really care since i'm an hourly you know you have to be in a certain time frame neons everyone else's parked i'm way out there in the parking lot closer to where the trees are and i you know close the door i'd just <unk> like okay another day and i hear the birds singing and i just stopped for a minute and listen to the birds and that's the sort of tears me up there i you know <unk> wait a minute okay in that nasty sterile office where the windows don't even open <unk> um i will be for the next eight hours or so but out here there still is some life going on and just sort of tears me up to know that okay i can come back to it you know [laughter] so then yeah and that moment i mean nobody's gonna like interfere with that at all there you are you in the birds you know yup hey we can find good spanish wine over here speaking of the moment [laughter] every once in a while when you know i can i can remember just being that i'm with people are eating someplace you know and barcelona and uh brings me back i still haven't gone to that fresh french restaurant by your house i'm dying to go there i mean the one right next to the <unk> yeah well not french it's just it's just gourmet it's not <unk> oh really yeah yeah or even better yeah <unk> <unk> for special occasion you know and and i will you might need a reservation too yeah i can have some some visitors and my family's planning on coming this summer <unk> in their fondue place i wanted to take them to also is the one over and gracia that i'm on a corner i think i think there's a couple of places and grassy that i've been going to uh-huh but uh there's one in the um barrio <unk> actually it's on the other side of leotana down over by the born now and it's got i've only been there i've only eaten there once right but i've been in a million times every time i pass some they have to show them the place uh-huh actually you know i know where i'm going to go to have a friend my friend from england <unk> remember <unk> i told you about <unk> my my old roommate mhm from oviato and she's coming she got a job that here she's coming on friday to live mhm and uh i <unk> that's like perfect <unk> move there will be able to oviato we used to go to this fondue place <unk> <unk> that'd be the perfect place to take her when she gets here yeah yeah well i'm glad to hear that you got a job that you like and and uh um think that you're you're able to stay that was <unk> little bit worried <unk> at first you know that when <unk> back there because <unk> the the money would run out probably in april or so and and i knew i knew i'd get a job right i mean i knew i would get a job but and <unk> <unk> just stopped thinking about <unk> <unk> thought well fuck it i look at it it's like inevitable and i'm i'm going to get some i want something to get something and i will but i didn't <unk> i i i just thought that you know i'll get a job and at this point if i get desperate i'll just have to take anything yeah and the fact that i like kind of fell into something that's fairly sweet i mean and the beginning everything kind of start that nice but i'm changing my attitude to the point where i'm not going to get stressed out about too much i'm not going to try to change anything i'm going to going out and doing <unk> good time <unk> you know and and i'm not going to i mean it's not the same either like from working with kids i mean that was like you know my my career for like eight years <unk> but this is you know more like in the united states doing well and you can always go back that if you wanted to you know we're in the states where maybe eventually once you have your residency are you working some someplace in spain too with with uh i don't have a big draw for right now if anything like i would like to open a bit i've always wanted to have like a bar or restaurant yeah make tons of money [laughter] like i'd love to that's why one <unk> win the lottery first though because it's like [laughter] money to hang up but um [noise] well yeah well i'm good and and so you're you're probably not going to come back for christmas which is cool emory was telling me that so yeah i've been making it it's too expensive war was asking you know she's she said you know you think <unk> or or you know i'm trying i'm thinking about come back for christmas what are you thinking <unk> don't do it unless you if you <unk> you're coming back next summer which is what she's figuring to go to school and that kind of thing it's like don't bother <unk> holidays it's just too hectic and too expensive <unk> gonna go back to the states <unk> yeah she's um <unk> this what she says now it could change of course i'm and she's actually she's been together with his name role i guess for well probably close <unk> close to a year and um he's been unemployed and he might get a job and low hello america and we've got <unk> digital mix up here [noise] when he cordless happens yeah let's go go to the bedroom and grabbed the other phone the uh the stupid <unk> i think we need to change the batteries or something or perhaps yeah i still have been able to get my answering phones hooked up no way yeah you know why why type of phone that we have a business phone you can hook up the answering machine so because it has to lines or something and <unk> the answering machine has <unk> hold on to or or let me say it has the yeah the answering machine <unk> well the other thing is like six lines right yeah you can certainly seen on the jack there's like two little wire copper cables the right <unk> <unk> and the jack ryan and this one has sex yeah and you have to actually i went down to find that i'd have to have a line run out from the street directly into my line <unk> got the <unk> of course not the same as getting a whole nother line yeah the problem is that with the business phone sort of deal <unk> <unk> yeah i mean it's like you don't really have all those individual telephone lines but now they all go through one phone <unk> got an answering machine cooked up in his office so yeah i mean that's the only way to do it you know you know <unk> if i i'm really thinking about i mean like i've been thinking about a million different ways to spend my money and i was thinking that he was he was actually suggesting that it's like like i thought maybe he would like financial like chip in but um pay him taking over <unk> nobody yeah yeah <unk> him when he's here he has all these wonderful suggestions which she forgets about [laughter] next time he comes back but <unk> <unk> we have we have a cordless phone which i love yeah and that the answer is all i need to raise my phone bill even higher the answering machine right and <unk> and i'm constantly like heather to this little space here out in the hall and i would love to get a line hooked up into my room mhm you know with the portable so even my room or the kitchen 'cause you know my my two greatest living spaces right i mean that could be done without much difficulty actually know like twenty thousand potatoes writer wow every thirty you know i mean i could do something a shame on on there but yeah i mean it's just a matter of of doing some wiring for something like that and get like another number i'd like to get another numbers of course yes you have to get telefonika ah yeah 'cause that would be a right to just like <unk> off of this phone or something rather yeah that would <unk> i mean that's actually quite simple yeah but then i still don't know if i could hook up the answering machine it's hard to say yeah i'd love the answering machine i probably i probably just as well not getting too dependent on the telephone he's [laughter] i don't know what <unk> did you guys are twenty three hours last spring or something or last uh when all the time <unk> you know what <unk> told me that that i ever you told her that um we we spoke on the phone every day for like an hour we we spoke on the phone a tremendous amount of i'd say at least in our yay yay [laughter] usually be sleeping i'd wake up i hear you guys talking you know [laughter] so [laughter] i know i i tell you the truth i really miss those phone calls to do a lot of fun i walk i walk past that your apartment and i've always like oh where to go visit them [laughter] yeah they're not there yeah yeah i know that can i tell you something but i have like i have like a bunch of spanish friends right

well at least you're way up there on that hill so imagine if you're at the bottom of your street or something <unk> you <unk> letter <unk> yeah yeah well i mean you know i saw in the paper <unk> you know had all these they had a couple of pictures you know they said oh all the houses around this area were flooded and all the metro stations were flooded out oh yeah tons of stuff wasn't weren't working like the electricity on like all the metro steps right the electric <unk> mhm <unk> electricity was out in most of them the cologne monument yeah when you look for that he was out on them <unk> <unk> yeah they're not prepared for a little [laughter] it's raining would shut down the city [laughter] but it's it's been kind of nice too because the weather's been a bit more buried so it hasn't been like just sweltering hot either i know well i wish that's what made me think because i wish we could get some change here and <unk> seems to be under the impression that it gets cooler in austin before like november and [laughter] i'm elaine has been utterly pessimistic about the weather since we got her and she's like oh it'll <unk> hundreds and blah blah blah and it's [laughter] i looked in the almanac uh-huh over they typically over a hundred three days out of the year okay so i'm not [laughter] they were living in chicago and say the same thing <unk> this year anyway mhm ah so so the rest of the time i was just like ninety eight <unk> <unk> it's <unk> it's been in the sort of mid nineties yeah well it's not like here if you remember correctly <unk> how does <unk> here as well or at least at least the humidity's not so bad as in florida florida's had a lot of rain too and my mum even my mom noticed the humidity today or yesterday when i was talking to her she said oh it's been so humid lately i'm like yeah well you must be a storm friends who've been sort of battering the coast <unk> have you been keeping up with that <unk> there's like all these hurricanes that have been just sort of parading through ah only the only one that i thought i'd watch the news a couple of morning and then i read in the newspaper <unk> that um hurricane felix or something yeah there's there's tons of them there was <unk> and now there's this was really funny there's a hurricane called <unk> and they all say <unk> [laughter] <unk> [laughter] pretty funny but i heard the feel like <unk> was <unk> they show pictures of it like on the radar mhm it was absolutely tremendous in the middle of the ocean creating disturbances along the coast <unk> keep hoping for one from the come out here we did get <unk> get the came out towards uh you know into the gulf of mexico and like <unk> part of mexico or something and we got some rain and we were like yes yes so late and i are like you know flagging them in like like uh you know like at airports trying to bring them are way come on come <unk> what is it like like <unk> <unk> around where you live 'cause i'm trying to visualize that was in austin one years ago and i can i can i can remember like the <unk> the city center <unk> capital and when you went to some cafes we stay with <unk> <unk> it must have stated <unk> certainly ida sheraton somewhere not far from the capital you know <unk> will there now there's there must be cause <unk> yeah okay i'm i'm not sure if it's always been there <unk> moved <unk> could've moved from some other place but well if you get into the countryside or i'm just not i mean just say ten or fifteen minutes away from the center of city you can be in the middle some hills <unk> oh really yeah oh yeah it is i remember being like extremely flat driving from dallas to areas very flat but austin is the is the eastern end of what they call the texas hill country <unk> and <unk> austin is actually pretty hilly uh let me assure you of that i ride my bicycle to work most days of the week and uh oh yeah [laughter] plenty of hills but when you go out further west i mean it's dramatically hilly there sort of chocolates and things like that oh beautiful yeah it's <unk> it's it's nice it's a nice area austin ice <unk> kind of like we're like old time austin nights now been here since nineteen eighty eight 'cause there's been enormous influx of population lately californians basically a lot of people from a lot of places but a lot of california and ah they're also mellow [noise] well the problem with california people yeah but but we're getting so many people that all of a sudden you know air pollution is starting to become a problem yeah and people don't like ride their bikes or anything like that but you know the thing is like you know everybody's driving their cars and people are ah you know they're starting to be this you know typical american city deal where the suburbs are starting to become very big you know <unk> and so uh i <unk> yeah <unk> <unk> we're we're really trying to fight that as much as we can i'm certainly doing what i can yeah well when we're in barcelona there are days when <unk> when the sky was really brilliantly blue and i thought oh it's so pretty and i thought every once in a while there was a day like that in in austin and since we've come back we've had so many of these hazy days nicole ozone action days where they encourage you not to a used car you're not to read [laughter] the thing is is that it's <unk> it's a little different i mean it's not caused by pollution that it's <unk> it's just that we have incredibly dry summers and uh i mean not so much unlike barcelona and that way i mean you remember the haze over the city and barcelona oh for sure i mean the only thing is when you know when the breeze comes in and blows it out right and yeah but er yeah for sure <unk> got tons <unk> mean barcelona far worse air pollution i mean the austin could even imagine i think of all you can ever got that bad it would be a people will be completely freaked out you know what was that ever happened one day like that well that's like in the in the new york area right the all the the cars on like up and down the jersey turnpike in the north of jersey all the cars from around here in new york city and whatever right <unk> and you could see this this line in the sky and it starts in the morning i rush hour and it makes its way the ground line it makes it way down the coastline during the day it's incredible and it's all basically well besides the other crap that they come back to the library but i think mostly supported by just exhaust fumes yeah <unk> yeah i mean the thing one of the things they said it's like all right since they've had the unleaded fuel and everything and it caused a tremendous drop in the amount of <unk> pollution per vehicle bunch we have so many more vehicles on the road now it's basically know <unk> <unk> you know drop whatsoever in a back that's pretty <unk> <unk> new jersey um we've got probably cold i'm lisa i'm lynn called lisa probably by the end of the day 'cause she goes back to school tomorrow <unk> really worth <unk> she goes back in the in august yeah well it's only macaroni you know when <unk> right before labor day the waiters and the states usually really we have to go back like a day or two days after labor day <unk> yeah in elementary school we always went back right after the jerry lewis telephone which was writing labor day and they they've changed it well here in austin it's pretty pitiful they they went back august fourteenth relay and in other places in california and florida and a few places they've been experimenting with year round schooling and a lot of areas and yeah you know i'm sure they would love <unk> have you round schooling it's more economically effective or whatever you know but i don't know how that is if they have to keep the school's running for for more <unk> <unk> thing is is that what what they get to do there's this whole deal to it but uh you know <unk> teacher hours [laughter] right i mean they they've done the year they managed to do the year round schooling thing where there is no big summer break but you have a bunch of three week breaks i kinda like what they do in england uh they take well every six weeks they take a week i think it is right but yeah he was a bit different but it's the same sort of idea where there is no huge break <unk> um and uh they've managed to do without raising any teachers' salaries magic that yeah 'cause it's the same amount of school days when leith throughout the course of the year is that what it is um it's it's actually they're trying to increase the school year as well yeah i'm <unk> what was the like the educational reason given oh there's not that big summer gap where students forget everything are they forget everything if they actually learned that they wouldn't have forgotten yeah [laughter] actually happened during the year now yeah summer that's for sure oh man what a drag to go to school i mean for for teachers for students for everybody to be in school this summer time there's nothing was ever question <unk> let's see countries like germany you have a a break from oh about the middle of july all the way <unk> you know october at least the middle <unk> october i'm angie they're still doing quite well <unk> well i mean it's it's one of those funny things i was watching t._v. and some <unk> politician republican surprise surprise <unk> that that's recorded for posterity [laughter] good something about <unk> bill bradley has dropped out of the <unk> yeah <unk> yeah but this guy was saying <unk> regulation has never helped any country and <unk> and uh you know countries ever be blah blah blah and i'm like you know germany and japan <unk> probably the most onerous regulations you can imagine <unk> they're so have you have <unk> and full of rules and they're doing pretty <unk> god damn well yeah <unk> <unk> the point is that you don't have to have any facts or information you can just take a blatant statement somebody has to just take your word for it and <unk> they broadcast it on national t._v. <unk> yeah that was part of

thing choo choo train uh-huh and um he's so funny he has this stuffed animal that my mother had given them it's this little soft cuddly i'm almost like a a windbreaker sort of material and um he calls it tyson [laughter] and everywhere he goes now he has to have this tyson with it [laughter] i haven't when your mom <unk> visit she'll be thrilled oh i doubt that i think it's great it's really it's so cute and he just loves it he has to sleep with it and the it's just it's the first time is really attached to a lot of attachment <unk> a lot of um [noise] ah it's well i guess attachment to something [noise] uh-huh [noise] and um what else is doing well it's a good it was so funny i took him to a birthday party yesterday it was first birthday party i was looking forward to it all week actually for two weeks never looking forward <unk> all <unk> first birthday party <unk> invited to so excited next door neighbor right bring <unk> over screamed [laughter] cried the whole time [laughter] miserable [laughter] bringing in the backyard but it was the backyard and he was so funny wouldn't hang out with the kids well so it was <unk> there was any chairs for <unk> know chairs he had to bring his own high chair serious sitting inside all the kids <unk> regular she has <unk> because it's an older kid too he's five years oh okay so uh but tyson justices walked in screaming <unk> cry cry cry cry cry suburban the backyard they have a cubby house with a little sandpit under <unk> that he played there with <unk> with trucks for so long he loved that they finally sort of calm down and then later on the kids were playing a game of the backyard with balloons the the balloons started popping and needed to say that <unk> [laughter] well we gotta go right [laughter] [laughter] things to look forward to it happens all the <unk> that every time i think it's going to be something wonderful he's just mortified like we took 'em to the concert <unk> the <unk> are you sent pictures <unk> you know and and at first we we we got we didn't sit <unk> there was like <unk> front you know the the floor but we were still in that sexual we could sit on the floor and as soon as we came out he was like [laughter] they're very <unk> didn't want to be near them so we were in the all the way the back and said that he was happy that okay so you know things can be pretty scary <unk> i'm <unk> i'm like well i think especially 'cause he was watching him on the table <unk> there and <unk> yeah and they're big you know yeah like <unk> on television yeah <unk> and so uh we're <unk> we want to play with the daycare so putting with daycare at least one day a week so that's a really good idea i didn't know if you guys were going to do that or not well it's a little bit <unk> <unk> it's a little bit of a dilemma right now because <unk> craig's mother watches tyson and she's very upset about the fact that we've even considered it yeah but it's much better for <unk> even just one day a week well exactly right then she'll be two i said he gets a little bit less stimulation with grandma because [noise] um there's a tremendous attachment as a matter of fact we thought that um we usually have a pretty bad day with <unk> saturday <unk> figure out why that's because that's what he has mommy and daddy get full tall and yeah so that would <unk> random <unk> you'll have a good saturday well that's what i figure well we're gonna start off with wednesday 'cause it just works easier for us to go from wednesday and then when he's two and a half goes to when's haven't wednesday fridays mhm and then <unk> can have a two half days out of the week and that's it [noise] so but it's <unk> it's it's very hard with that because she takes <unk> very personally you know like instead of just reading the other <unk> something that we want to do with the parents that also be good for you know she's just so personally where we're going to have battles with my mother in law and the baby's born oh yeah probably just you know for the same thing just you know they want you <unk> do the things but but then again you know if they're too opinionated [noise] like a i had a <unk> who was <unk> <unk> we have these battles about food every once in a while you know like uh uh if if if she's not you know she's giving us something that you shouldn't have enough i say no don't want them to have that <unk> it's like it's too personal like oh you don't think i'm doing a good job <unk> yeah so but that's just stuff that we deal with it it's it's not too bad but uh where you get her to watch them when she's totally great <unk> uh listen to test tyson has the best <unk> such a oh you should just such a really inquisitive kid <unk> you have a great backyard and huge just a rain forest and um it's next to a resort a a a resort that um people would get the feeling that they're in the middle of nature lake with all these birds <unk> trees and all the um the the places to stare these little <unk> <unk> through the fence you can see that and <unk> and actually from the house you could see the lake and it it gives the appearance like it's part of their backyard so dumb because the with the vegetation so anyway <unk> the fence now <unk> the birds at all these <unk> water birds and ducks come over and he feeds him down <unk> through the fence all the time that's pretty good yeah it's really good and they have a spa the backyard susan constantly in there and <unk> gran dead so we're showing and things and and lose made these pathways through the ah old through the trees mhm it's like a a a you know like <unk> so each each time it's like he's on his lip venture going through all the tree that's pretty <unk> and everything oh listen he's such an outdoor kid it's incredible mhm that's a lot of fun yeah and <unk> healthy it's better for him to be in daycare at his age oh i think so i we have one day a week i personally think so because he's really very socially an adult because i don't get to um i don't get to take him to a play group like my other mothers like i don't get together with other mothers and you know have the kids <unk> yeah i think the research that something like up until two years it's better to be home about starting a two year it's better to be in a daycare for some part of the yeah well you know it's it's used <unk> studying the socialization process to bed early you know when i was always the best of both worlds because you'll be able to have 'em at home and and daycare yeah so yeah yeah for the sake <unk> all the time was difficult because i went to visit um a couple of daycare centers recently uh-huh and um what i notice is that the group that they had between fifteen months and two and a half years they keep together yeah and um it's just that when you go in that section that'll be good for him then because he'll have a little bit of time with the younger kids to get yeah to it and then he'll be able to go with the older kids oh definitely definitely 'cause then then it's between two and a half three and a half that's in another <unk> get the larger percentage anyway yeah but <unk> i'm a <unk> it's funny when you go into the younger group <unk> just doesn't seem like much going on they can't do as much as they don't do that it's not real colorful and that has <unk> projects around and there's a lotta beds around because er mattresses 'cause they they have to nap and and um there's just too too much but it's so funny <unk> rolls sick they're all like uh does is er rather not everywhere like i'm a little more you know and so i know it's <unk> he'll be fun i mean i just want him to the last one i went to he really seems like he just had a lot to do you know like right from the start start playing in the backyard and looking at the kids and being a bit more interested <unk> yeah i think it's a good idea well we don't know what we're gonna do yeah we haven't decided that's right because you're going to take a certain minutes <unk> work right yeah i get six months and then after that we're going to figure out what's going on [noise] can you go back to work part time yeah i can go back part time and <unk> we're hoping his i'll be part time and maybe norm can be part time and that'd be great then we won't have to put the baby in daycare but that'd be really <unk> yeah he really does not want the baby in daycare and all yeah i mean just feels really strongly against that but then again <unk> should have moved near his mother [laughter] oh right i mean there is no way like maybe our inlaws or the same like i don't want her to i know she's going to tell me what to do and stuff but my guys just taking care of my kids are like in another world funny though like you think that you're going to be able to you know like i don't know how i want to raise my child but you really you take a lot of advice people especially you know <unk> an experience mother you know about simple thing like at first you know i've done all my reading and it's like the baby's breast feeding that's the only the baby needs that said they've done anything else besides breast milk and sure enough with tyson you know <unk> suggested supplementing with the water and now he doesn't need water yeah he has breast milk the sure enough <unk> does he was so miserable [laughter] we started trying <unk> just giving them <unk> and it was great uh-huh absolutely help them so much oh yeah and even in the future <unk> do you mean for when he's crying and stuff <unk> i'm sort of i i'd give him i'd give him water um yes sort of ah maybe in between like he's just had to feed you know we're <unk> the the notes feeding you know he wants more what's more breast milk and get myself <unk> early summer <unk> i'm just the water bed and when did you start that are pretty much right away well yeah they say like in the books that says not to only given breast for like the first six weeks or something like that <unk> oh wait a second i'm probably had it maybe week five is when we started travelling <unk> bit <unk> maybe even slightly before that um and the other thing that i would do is that it's after the six weeks if tyson was <unk> <unk> it's a a child was um uh just doesn't not satisfied from breast milk uh-huh that i would give a top up front i mean a formula <unk> yeah i'm not i'm not like i'm in nebraska read but i don't want to be totally tied i don't know it depends on the type <unk> it depends on you supply like some women gorgeous <unk> absolutely are huge being gorge i never <unk> you know like i had heard that particularly big one i saw you know and all so that was right afterwards well what what happened to that tyson would fall asleep <unk> all the time on the breast what would happen is that he would feed for very short period of time in the fall asleep and then um he wanted feeding and we're between every once <unk> two hours <unk> oh yeah and i just never found that he was satisfied who's always crying we he wasn't <unk> but it's just that was never say she ate it and um so in the future or if if that happened again to me i would <unk> supplement thing i'd i'd um he's going to be at christmas time with our <unk> you know that oh yeah babies like six weeks old oh i want to be able to go [laughter] i mean i want them to watch the baby and has to be able to do something well you <unk> especially if you if you end up i'm doing well was breast feeding you can um you can't <unk> leave <unk> yeah oh yeah that's because i had i couldn't do anything like that i tried i had all the <unk> <unk> even <unk> i even rented an electrical one and i couldn't i couldn't extracted old [noise] so um [noise] uh and then when i put tyson on formula put 'em on goats milk and then he's now he's on soy milk and and listen he's he's great with so many kids have sensitivities the cows milken tyson <unk> he's never sick that's good we're not we're not going <unk> 'cause normally allergic and my brother was allergic oh right oh definitely don't know there's no way we can both <unk> is the closest to to mother's breast you can get we have a formula here carry care which is really nice formula and um and then <unk> soy he's just on um on a particular brand of soy milk now and he's just he's great i mean it's a little bit <unk> expensive but like i said we he's just done so well i can't see putting them on to cows now no why bother me cringe when you know yeah so like just things like that and i think um [noise] yeah probably probably as of the six weeks i'll tell you one thing it's so confining even when we weren't holiday like you are you going to be a little bit of a holiday <unk> around the six week period [noise] we were just absolutely <unk> miserable in that respect those those <unk> that <unk> couldn't do and um i felt so guilty because on christmas eve <unk> i had i drink too much <unk> and it was but they don't actually get the alcohol but they get the bread products of alcohol consumption <unk> remember <unk> sitting there going <unk> tyson fell asleep at about eleven o'clock and insuring up seven o'clock in the morning he was still asleep [laughter] and it was just <unk> going <unk> still sleep i wonder what's wrong with <unk> you've never slip this little <unk> [laughter] and then after that he developed rush yeah the the um the sugar you know the access <unk> yep played habit 'cause he would've retracted i'm the anyway from me just from being born yeah i've had easter the past yeah that was the last <unk> soon because we're we're thinking about going to l._a. in january oh really yeah ah that'd be great you think <unk> carry yeah yeah i hope so too if she if she does if um you don't get to go down there and make sure she kept up to see oh yeah she'll probably come out <unk> guess i don't know where we can go down but what i mean was it really horrible or ah know traveling was weird at that age is yeah that's what i think to somehow they told me don't do it i don't know it's not the best tyson right now would be so horrible [laughter] he he is such a months like well we take 'em to restaurants or anywhere <unk> i can't go food shopping with them so he is a monster [laughter] so do you get when they're babies but but every child is so different like you have these women <unk> oh no our babies great sleeps all night doesn't pee susan's baby wakes up they just sort of sit there and they don't need to be stimulated and they don't need to be picked up and i mean we can never leaves tyson just lay there <unk> okay [noise] you know so i was just um i was cleaning out this room that we have and i and i ran into the pictures from ah um we were at stake <unk> oh yeah they had a chance to tell you had <unk> yeah i was going to ask and i forgot when she had a boy she was two weeks early oh my god to weed yeah she was there something wrong or she was just really just two weeks early <unk> i'm like august the first or something in mid mid july yeah had a a little boy name michael oh great michael <unk> michael <unk> what <unk> had enough credit believe <unk> we were considering actually oh has french and english you know what was having a laugh too because um they met in puerto rico and and and <unk> it would be have yeah [laughter] and it just wrote back memories from from san diego you ready to a hobby yeah [laughter] [laughter] oh but but um you know they moved into their house at the same <unk> actually the pictures that i'm sending has <unk> know pictures of the baby <unk> should send any but a couple of pictures of the new <unk> wow yeah it's nice it's it's um it's just uh it's it's large oh no okay so large periods that it's big but i don't think it's i don't think it's supposed to be excessively big it's just it's a high house and <unk> that's all <unk> feeling and um [noise] what else um that to the block of lead it's just beautiful like this pictures during the summertime and the whole thing it's all <unk> case was just beautiful trees and uh you can't even see the neighbors and um then you're right huh huh that's alive huh oh they live <unk> where they want to live and uh well it's really stinks 'cause you know like if you look in my backyard we got a fence that you could see right away trees that are just coming up you know in a basement from it [laughter] i bet you next oh you didn't tell me that you you <unk> you told <unk> new environment my door i see the word because there is a huge park there's it's not a parking the nature reserve across the street <unk> basement apartment yeah but <unk> <unk> [laughter] [noise] oh um anyhow so here's my other questions okay did you use drugs dream labor uh now i just uh you are so quick i yeah i was very quick yeah uh-huh but but because i had a i was i was i went from a did they did they <unk> are not pardon did they give you <unk> center <unk> toxin or okay now if if if if they start talking about the try it well yeah but <unk> brought <unk> usually uh-huh you're going to be getting up to fourteen days overdo <unk> know they're they might do things a little bit different and you can get it's probably fourteen days overdo they give you <unk> <unk> all right well that's that's really call but that's pretty <unk> actually <unk> i'd say your system there would be as good as it is here now i'm sure <unk> on hold him and they don't do the syrians first like over the <unk> and i might even even if the baby's breach there's a chance that would be delivered nationally here oh well if you had the choice if um i don't know uh you don't have a choice of private or no everything here is public there is no such private here have any <unk> uh yeah i mean reach reach <unk> delivery would would be hard would be very hard on you guys that hopefully like if if if there was any sort of choices asked for the section because both <unk> can be dangerous for the baby yeah but um no had no drugs but the only thing is since i went from second second stage to transitional stage right um oh is it no first day <unk> this year age and i i didn't realize that i was in tradition i still thought it was first days because they hadn't evaluated may they figure out where you <unk> for most of your labor or did you go to the hospital later now as soon as my water broke okay so you you could have been having contraptions for a few days and not even knowing that you actually when and when your water brown wondering when <unk> wasn't having much going on and then sure enough i die late it very quickly like like i got to the hospital and when we're very nonchalant with me because she says well honey you can't be too for you still smiling having um contractions they went from five minutes apart two three minutes apart in the time i was in the car um so when i was there and then they they put me into the shower and um and then she gave me an animal [noise] i thought it we we don't have <unk> here well that's good <unk> 'cause i always thought it was having problems because of the enema yeah and um and sure enough i was i was in transition i kept thinking to myself craig i'm gonna have to speak to them about drugs because this is very pace pool and um so but i had forgotten all about the gas <unk> totally forgot about the gas and them citizen has some of the gas i felt much better yeah okay well they probably um you were probably in first stage for a long time and didn't know it didn't really feel that that possibly because i for several weeks though i had been getting i had i had um some terry and um you know like uh tearing feeling around my coupons so they could have been yeah softening and besides that the doctor had checked me actually that's a induced because i was five days over and he asked me my examinations list and i could do an internal exam if you want me to it 'cause it it might bring things on uh-huh so we did a swipe on it and then the next day i had to go into <unk> to 'em for <unk> little <unk> monetary wants to make sure everything's okay and he was so surprised he goes i'm really surprised that that didn't do anything he was just really really surprised i went home and then within an hour that that's what i okay but <unk> hurts hearts on this one of 'em are <unk> <unk> what happened with <unk> did you have to get into <unk> to me yeah that that's good did they <unk> you terror i what's called grace i tore a little bit on the inside god that's really good it was great god's you made <unk> man <unk> was it uh i did so miserable with um with the pregnancy that i was very excited [laughter] that's what people keep <unk> 'cause we've been talking about having another baby you say oh you're pregnant yes and now now i'm going <unk> my parents come because i don't want to be sick when the <unk> oh yeah i can totally understand i had like the most miserable i wasn't as sick as you but i was so miserable there's no way i could do anything or anybody or i wanted to do it like for me like when i can't imagine as having one kid at home and being morning sick the it was awful ooh yes and and and even now i'm surprised <unk> when i think about that first march <unk> when i was watching the tenth that i started getting sick and um i was so miserable that whole month that was really full on and it was the busiest months at work we turned away business and i would i would finish up um early <unk> i'd say no no no couldn't take any more patients at the end of the day <unk> we've finished by five sort of thing instead of lingering until six <unk> and um i don't know if it was just flat out and <unk> couldn't <unk> whatever <unk> probably happened was that i wouldn't talk to anyone would just you know i'd get sort of get the job done just go in there just leave because i'd have <unk> as soon as i've only met and started smoking i feel nauseated not going to grow up and now the thing that i can do i don't know how you're going to be able to do this when you're pregnant i can't stand for long periods of time is what like how do you adjust to people how to use the <unk> for that long i'm actually that was okay i i did pretty well with that i didn't i'm standing <unk> cause i walk i walk i walk fine like i could walk for hours that would be okay except i can't walk fast because i get contractions when i walk fast oh right now i can i can walk and then i'm adjusting was pretty easy if i had to do was buy posture just somebody that would be a little bit awkward 'cause i can't stand them i stand for like ten minutes that's it if i walk you know i can walk for half an hour or whatever doesn't matter but the the <unk> <unk> no good now the second time around though might be a little bit different for me because i'm <unk> you just you show a lot quicker you figure that tell me anyway and yeah and like this woman i'm staying right now at the office she's helping with the computer she's just she hasn't game very much way she said she's only gained six kilos mhm but um she's um she's just really awkward inner self you know like <unk> just really sort of very full that she still has all she has another four weeks ago which technically i would be stopping market about this time though i think i was going to try and push it to just stopping two weeks before [laughter] i try and do as much as i can because [noise] to get all <unk> we just you know it's just it's just a cost effective we want to try and work as far as possible yeah yeah and what about when you took off afterwards <unk> incredibly board [noise] i'm not <unk> it's funny you days we'd goes so fast because you just trying to get certain things done you didn't like it was a challenge to get all this stuff done for tyson during the day <unk> because we do a close knit yeah but i was going to ask to what is it just doesn't have to wash i'm not really that really just open

the hotel <unk> they wanted to know you're gonna have to try to figure out how to get the <unk> figured out the bus schedules yeah well the buses horrendous maybe we could especially if you've got a lot of time we could beat in manhattan or something or the best thing to do just to call up the korean taxi service we use this call one of them and have him that <unk> writing you what are your place <unk> that's a possibility because <unk> there's a service we use that uh fort lee mhm yeah they probably have some um are sort of off the records crisis uh yeah yeah well they they uh um you know <unk> you said your ten miles away i'm time ten miles away from manhattan it's probably straight out a roof three <unk> uh i know from driving it's about um a white or thirty minutes or something thirty minute drive <unk> yeah <unk> that sounds like more than ten mile well no i say it's thirty miles direct out from manhattan but coming from fort lee at six thirty minutes while it's <unk> you have to go through the total gates and things like that it's it's from fort lee it's about twelve miles something <unk> okay yeah <unk> yeah okay yeah <unk> and that's one possibility yeah you know the vertical travelling in new jersey is is very difficult yeah yeah well that's one <unk> one of the things i didn't wanna be in the same place so you know the number you know <unk> well tell me again i don't have it with oh what was the one point hotel yeah you know when <unk> point mhm you know <unk> all the news from korea the releasing that uh forty for the guys have been a prison forty four years i haven't seen all you know you have the communism yeah oh yeah yeah <unk> reading one thing about that that got some attention than the <unk> some sort of riot caused by a g._i. end the soul subway oh that was after the building collapsed everybody forgot about that you know after that it's you know four or five hundred people <unk> few g._i.s fighting in the subway was nothing you know and that's all <unk> the prime <unk> the prime news so like i told you that uh the internet or transmission there you know one of these guys that i was in the army with <unk> uh suddenly pops up in new jersey you know not just new york there yeah i was asking about that well well they i think well it's it's it's it's the hanging on by the <unk> the fingers sort of thing but the only the only guy who's <unk> <unk> <unk> is is accurate and he made it big but but <unk> harvard yeah oh well that's nice <unk> you know that they they hire back a lot of the people who graduate yeah that'd be a lot of money in the bank yeah and that's the only university <unk> does that you know but i mean the fact that he he actually did get an academic physician that's that's uh 'cause all those people who went off all through the bright died um i was another guy who went down to u._s._c. ah here last neat you know the only the only person i know for me for literature was the guy name mccan who bite the at cornell yeah he's still around i seen his name pop up you know but ramses' vanished uh he's supposed to be in japan from what i've heard but he he he he fell into a trap or he could never get tenure yeah well he was at columbia <unk> they're like five years and they turned them down for tenure then he went somewhere else and he he was down in uh college park maryland you know and i i think it was only a non tenure track down there than it supposedly supposed to be back in japan now you know but you know he's he's probably you know becoming english teacher it's yeah i know a guy believe and i know that from manhattan who's <unk> major he did an m._b._a. [laughter] believe it or not even have an english teacher now huh he got a a a set of while they they don't really have a ten year you know foreigners don't have tenure in japan for a long term teaching you know <unk> you know after i told her that university in in a way i don't envy him you know the <unk> people are are second class citizens i well you you you should see with the japanese students after they torture them for six years <unk> middle school and high school they don't want to do anything in college you know well let's see what the korean students the same way you know what they're doing the teaching at rutgers are are are koreans and japanese are not leading the class right by any means you know they they've you know they want to relax for a couple of years i'm try try to give them some lectures about um you know that's that's great you brought your body declasse but you must remain conscious [laughter] all the biggest problem i had was trying not to lump them i had i had to recycle the same questions two or three times <unk> get them to pass <unk> with humiliating for the teacher you know just you know you know i i i told my friends were taught thing and i said well you know i i gave them the questions once they you know two thirds <unk> sales i gave them the same questions almost all the same questions again and a half of them fail you know sometimes you have the same questions three <unk> [laughter] yeah yeah that's that's a you know that you know that kind of teaching position i can live without you know i got i got a couple of good possibilities now i told you <unk> uh one is uh you know digging media type ventures <unk> and i'm negotiating with them you know and they have this uh computer things are coming up in march and believe it or not they want me to be the president of the company <unk> bill gates <unk> excuse me you either <unk> the next bill gates while you know when you start talking about the c._e._o. you get all sorts of privileges with that you know like a car driver you know see a big fat salary and i'll look forward to a certain soft ninety seven <unk> [laughter] no it's actually uh it's just that that that new operating system that lives in japan uh no uh like i told you that several months ago uh-huh uh and they're gonna they're gonna cory and i said oh yeah there are <unk> i was looking at a korean or american bulletin board and there is some sort of korean system out that's been developed in the states i don't know what <unk> this is the professor who developed this one is here yeah uh the one in the states is probably to work on unix or something you know <unk> the it's difficult to send messages and korean across the internet you know and i've got a copy of you know they uh yudora for english yeah uh but i can't you know people tried to send me foreign language message you don't get all these nonsense characters on my <unk> well <unk> you know they're well there are some um there is some going on because some of the on the korean bulletin board some of the messages you pick it up and get just um you know <unk> <unk> what amounts decode it looks like uh the the rutgers system is ah i only discovered that there are certain unmarked computers that will receive pictures and if they don't receive pictures the new way to get a message that we can't accept this or instead of um instead of a picture you'll get alphabet and numbers [laughter] sort of over and over again and uh some of the korean messages have been like that and and uh apparently they're they're not ah pornographic they're just um it's it's the <unk> the the probably decode it if you could work out the sit down to work out the pattern but <unk> that there is they are sending some side of the korean americans are using some kind of a a system here and they probably do anyway this this new thing is for that architecture my friend in tokyo did mhm and they're going to korea nights and put it on the market here is a good possibility will succeed here even though it wasn't so widely in japan <unk> because it's a new type of korean language processing supposed to be much better than <unk> than they used <unk> lousy you know there are two korean movies that are about to be filmed in new york and washington one is uh korea t._v. production of korea gate and <unk> remember that <unk> some business phone [noise] they're going to do that in in washington and they the uh i happen to pick up a copy of the the the uh actors tree newspaper and they had a call for a caucasians to play the senators [laughter] they believe in and i met <unk> girlfriend oh mandy rice none on it and he had a korean girlfriend too you know well you know the guy who was tied up with him um in korea was peter best dollar meal and he's supposedly <unk> to go back in testify to congress and remember that but um and i guess he's still in korea some way i i haven't seen anyone from the the only one i saw was a resident and you don't even remember his name he was he's <unk> here now fat uh-huh and i still got his weight married this korean girlfriend and ah you know they they had a child and you know he's still working and doing government work <unk> i don't envy him <unk> and i admire his ability to absorb bullet punishment [laughter] yeah yeah <unk> guy who bites might be over there conceivably well he was you wouldn't have i guess you wouldn't have known him a guy named send those <unk> i heard of his name before and i remember hearing about him down in a kennel yeah and then he he was in some kind of consulting company or something you know he was he uh he would very people and get them pregnant and abandon them and marry somebody else and get the pregnancy apparently married somebody uh very well placed whose father sort of gave him his own company as a as a wedding president [laughter] so evil evil gets do reward and the and you know [laughter] well i believe in karma i think it's going to catch up with them well maybe two lives from now but [laughter] uh that's the only made the comment there has to be a hell because <unk> somebody's gotta catch up with these people were making you know speaking of like band it's right now um but uh no i'm i'm a sort of weary of the of the uh the sort of thing here i don't know this this whole uh uh i don't know <unk> society <unk> demoralizing and nobody nobody keeps their word anymore <unk> suddenly struck me the one of the reasons of pulling out of <unk> was was being tired of of being sort of a marginal person but it's sort of the same [laughter] sort of the same here you know [laughter] but i can't get my i can't get my uh visa revoked or they can't refuse to renew my visa but just about everything else [laughter] uh you know you just gotta you gotta take care of yourself you know but it's <unk> you you can't you can't be a ton of a few do depend another other people well the thing is you know you're gonna you know save your pace i can retire you know you know but it's it's interesting with your life hoping hoping for some i i my favorite thing is there's no such thing as a good job you know just very types of bad job you know now even you know the thing about you know i mean see a company i already know lots of problems i get into that thing yeah well i'd i would be sort of wary because i i do consulting work <unk> in quotation marks once a week for a korean company here and like every other uh company i've worked for it's it's uh i'm i'm there i'm play toy you know it's sort of sort of neat to have somebody that you can send off on sort of uh what what is it the nights used to do a nights we'd go out and um oh what's the term but not not to go out on a mission they oh they go out on the question <unk> and so yeah so i i get sent out on on frivolous quest you know in return <unk> sometimes surprisingly successfully to discover that they're no longer interested in what i've been [laughter] that happens all the time no longer interested in what i've been <unk> to do and uh you know and <unk> you know we're getting involved international scale you know the different things like that's the way business works in all cultures you know just a matter of how much chaos you know one day is supposed to do something to do it and then they tell you the next day while you're not supposed <unk> have done that you've done this and we don't need that any more then goes on all the time you know but it's it seems to be a lot of times the tendency to you know you hope you're you're you're put american to to do this kind of thing as long as they pay you know that [laughter] twenty bucks an hour or something thirty bucks an hour well there's also that sort of uh we we can't tell you that much because you'd be paid more than one of us that will not happen [laughter] the company i work and all the foreigners are paid hire an annual salary <unk> and the koreans see how <unk> you get bonus bonuses no no no they they didn't want <unk> system yeah 'cause there's no bonus here it's not a real bonus anyway you know it's just your you divide your manual salary up in the bonus plus mostly yeah yeah but i mean the the <unk> if you're <unk> you can get a bonus myself or not you know like if it's part of my annual figure yeah but <unk> but uh i don't know like did get a pay raise just <unk> yeah because <unk> the um you know i'm still the lowest paid in the company compared illegal or engineers which is one of the you know want to hang on to go out to uh get a new job you know <unk> think either of those things the the uh what was that the computers are the the media what's the media when are you nuts multimedia type thing you know the studios and probably <unk> don't know what the hell yeah they've they want to go into media across the board which is that a lot of work you know what would you say media you mean like doing a some sort of interactive c._d. or something or no one's all types of things you know that that would be one part of it you know some kind of just shit like that but also the movie making movies showing <unk> well the movie industry and <unk> still pretty <unk> nobody <unk> how much money on the all the all the big companies don't want to get into a you know media ventures <unk> because you know whether the money's in the software you know so uh you know the setting up companies on the outside <unk> studying media mentioned i don't know how many are going to be successful you know <unk> know that there's there there is some <unk> i have heard some irritation here because the both taiwan and and and a p._r. see movies are doing incredibly willing and and sometimes they're shown not even dubbed in in in regular american movie houses <unk> this this is when you think about it is amazing will speak chinese you know <unk> everybody has his speaking chinese and the the and the <unk> subtitled which americans you know will not tolerate theoretically and all of it's a chinese plot you know it's not you know it's not a kung fu <unk> thing <unk> it's like you know you <unk> n._p._r. see it might do with the revolution or something like that uh and somewhat you know sort of critical and the taiwan <unk> they had a modern story with uh with with to this chinese guy was in love with an american i'm chinese guy was love with american boy but he was forced into marrying chinese girl for the benefit of his parents his little controversial for taiwan but it went down here and uh well they're in that film they did have one american but it's it's amazing when when the american public will not tolerate uh a french or spanish that they will they will go to see a chinese fell into <unk> with with everybody non caucasian but anyway the result of this is the koreans are uh the korean movie makers you're flipping out oh if we can only get <unk> the american market and start getting some of those things <unk> ourselves and uh all those long as they don't fall into the trap of formula film well it's it's the same it's the same result if they had with with um with <unk> with <unk> about a winning the double price for literature is just uh if we just translate something from korea and in the english than we can get the price to no end the problem is when he was he got a problem with content [laughter] not simply a translation problem um but um there there was this there is a sort of interest in in a no cheese at the chinese <unk> <unk> why can't why can't koreans but it's it's interesting that <unk> you know japanese used to have an r. movie following the japanese movie industry has sort of down the drain and watch mostly porno movie though yeah but it's like one of the guys i went to a linguistics department with later dropped out and became a porno movie film director and since they weren't enough uh actors anyway to became an actor so [laughter] we probably wanted to be [laughter] uh you know it's kind of embarrassing the professor you know got a metal from the <unk> and everything and <unk> world famous professor and uh you know one of his students and [laughter] i'm film you know that you know they're only simulated sex act you know well let's <unk> you'll <unk> you'll end up the mess [laughter] yeah oh uh bail again yeah that's <unk> good you know [laughter] but uh so uh how's uh yeah uh so did all the things are just just sort of the sort of hanging uh queen <unk> supposed to do the bank nobody has not made any any contact these are supposedly setting up his wife and child here while he fills out his contract and earns money there and he you hopes that his wife <unk> can you can try to sort of track a potential job openings i don't know what's gonna happen about that he's gonna have lots of publications as he was smart to be using his tired already publications even shitty ones yeah well the question is more better getting getting them getting demand i think i think he must have been <unk> thesis now but it's it's the uh you know <unk> got the p._h._d. i think you <unk> i think he does have the <unk> but you know it's the um you know who you know there are a lot of the h._t.s out there and oh sure yeah and uh i don't know <unk> the <unk> see what else let's see what happens <unk> his best chance as a job overseas i will get in the in the u._s. you know that so it's easy can be you know political science professor plus english <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> long and he's smart enough to stay out of islamic countries <unk> bizarre rules yeah yeah right yeah well he when he goes out lenny has to be sort of bundled up and you know <unk> he has to be on the left <unk> his wife <unk> all his wife yeah she has to be but bundled up and uh um the uh uh it's it's amazing over there that the the saudi government was apparently dictating to the uh he was trying to get the his child <unk> <unk> what are the embassy schools and they saw the government was starting to uh dictate to these to these schools you know what's going to go on and them you know that the <unk> the curriculum will be muslim you <unk> <unk> [laughter] and uh the children will sit on opposite sides of the classroom [laughter] i wouldn't take you know i i wouldn't take a job in seventy no matter how much you know he must be tax free status alright yeah i think so well i think you know he was just you know he's got he's got pressures we don't have <unk> he's got a wife and child and uh uh they pay animal and i don't know he'd never <unk> he never said that but <unk> you did say he said he saving money which is a a important before well at least been you know being in graduate school i think it was pretty uh uh mouth you know the sort of the graduate school thing and i think lenny was down that road learning has taken some courses too and uh you know and of course having the sun and so forth and the who will you know obviously get increasingly expensive as he gets older so it was on when i was surprised you haven't run into <unk> sure [laughter] i don't know i i found i found a <unk> down in maryland that's right yeah well you don't know if he's the one <unk> you want me to send you a list of everybody <unk> well i can i can get one of those those those programs too i i once i tried looking forward for <unk> who's disappeared <unk> i guess soldiers <unk> there was <unk> was the one <unk> kentucky oh i can't see him in kentucky we will you know and he has to go where you know where the where the money is and you know he was supposed to become a lawyer

you know she could stop it at any time all she has to do is pay me among the salary the way that the code of proper behavior and the goddamn a law say she has two yeah she would do that i would completely drop all charges other what's going on but she didn't really tell me what what <unk> have you ended up doing well the deal is they gave me four days notice yeah <unk> that's illegal right

i've been to a city hall to complain um there's uh foreigners labor corner there um [noise] i've been to uh the the big places one called the <unk> which is kind of uh i guess that's the ministry <unk> labor really uh-huh and their their their their labor watchdogs really um it sounds like the right place to go yeah and they're all they're taking care of it um had a couple of sessions with them and then a taco of tacos mother's customers um turned out <unk> <unk> well he works for the uh the water works labor union and he said he'd go down and <unk> and watch when i went to the ministry of labor and you know just kinda keep an eye on say it's going to bring a friend who was friend turned out to be not the absolute top dog but one of the boss was of the <unk> department of the all japan all labor union behind a conglomerate kind of thing <unk> he's extremely nice guy i mean i think it's probably because he knows how much power he house and he's a i've got a he tried to get unemployment insurance and <unk> couldn't but he tried high took me to lunch um this afternoon he's going to introduce me to hello work i'm the and then it's a work finding service and oh right okay um and he uh he made sure that the uh people at the ministry <unk> labor actually sat down and listen to what i said he went to the obikko uh-huh he made a he made masenaga have a little have talk with um explain to him what was going on and after he heard my side and their side uh-huh he decided well there's something fucked up here and he turned it over to the ministry <unk> labor and said you guys take care of it i think they own own some money so uh i'm pretty sure that i'm going to get a that i'm going to get something out of i'm not sure how much but at any rate of shokko's pastime at least getting the satisfaction at the moment yeah because you know i mean the worst thing <unk> have a bad image right <unk> <unk> <unk> he makes it sound like you know all this all this stuff's going on but really i would i knew when she was telling me what i know even more now is that a couple of people that come in and showed her that they're not happy with the way that <unk> <unk> <unk> that means she's got a bad image <unk> this was <unk> now she <unk> she has <unk> everybody <unk> everybody thinks he's an awful person and <unk> you're going around killing everybody in town and all this stuff well i am [laughter] they're right i am i'm telling anybody who's got five seconds [laughter] no died the obikko badly over um it's it's just piss me off and if she calls again you might want to mention to or that all she has to do is pay me this money that i have coming to me and hope that she doesn't understand that you you don't talk to her i have not seen her for two months uh-huh i don't expect to ever see her have direct contact with her again um she never once said anything to me i mean i i i did not she never told me she never had any contact with me um the last time i saw her was when <unk> well actually it's been a month and the last time i saw her was when we uh took you to the airport uh-huh that was the last time i saw yeah um so [laughter] i really i really have no sympathy for the woman i'm sorry oh and you know she <unk> she had <unk> he was going to um she said that he was preparing or a letter <unk> on your be have to be given to some people so that he could try and find you another job yeah right <unk> right and <unk> but anyway he wanted he wanted me to know you know he i was right in the middle <unk> writing this letter and all of a sudden stuff come down out of the blue and you know i mean i i'm not going to give him a letter from keeps this stuff up and stuff like that and <unk> anyway i knew that was <unk> when i <unk> i would rather have a month's salary than a letter from shokko <unk> [laughter] um well i had just absolute crap though i mean you don't fire somebody and then go out of your way <unk> job yeah been help them find another job and <unk> that's just absolute bullshit and especially because i could adopt basically <unk> told me in as many words you're outta here because shokko doesn't like it yeah [laughter] and you've never had any you've never had any real contacts and <unk> that's that's <unk> right right <unk> now <unk> just bullshit but uh i'm at any rate she's uh she's welcome to a simple and i told the fellas labor union this i said you know i said at this point all i want as i said i'll take june non amman because i calculated the the way they showed me that it's calculated mhm and i think they actually when they paid me my last month's salary they paid me a about amman amman too much actually i think i'm sure they did that simply because it was easier to calculate uh-huh ah they gave me jugoman for august and then for the last eleven days that i work uh the sixteenth of august to the twenty sixth of august uh-huh your mind and i think are really <unk> that it should've been actually <unk> six hundred something yen that'll <unk> eight eight days ten days or whatever they gave me a jew on so figuring that into the calculation i think they still only seventeen mon <unk> take some spare change <unk> and anytime they want to just handed over to me it's done it's finished right but um you know what when i was telling them the last couple of days they're always saying masenaga and and <unk> said you know i've i've been to i i i've been getting some advice and i've been told that famous in america turns out you do have to pay me among salary but we don't know anything about that shit <unk> said well how about finding out before this turns ugly they said no it's not our job to find out you're the one who <unk> he's going to be getting the money you find out so that's what did <unk> did what they told me too yeah i told him i said look it's either you guys find out what the rules are for yourselves since you're not going <unk> since you're not believing me mhm you guys find out and follow the rules are i'm going to push <unk> right so they had plenty of warning they knew i was going to do it maybe they didn't think i could maybe they didn't think i knew where <unk> maybe they didn't think i knew where to go or or or that i could be that i could get myself listen to [laughter] but uh that was false confidence [laughter] well it's pretty funny <unk> <unk> he sounded <unk> did you see the <unk> <unk> he and and <unk> like she actually called me to to surprise <unk> you know i think you know she did indeed it out she didn't have somebody push the button no i figured he would do that but she didn't she didn't she was a person on the phone when i pick it up mhm and then she put <unk> tell me that the same thing he already told me that you know right he couldn't believe all this stuff from happening and we would have <unk> you being and well and i said well jeeze i'm sorry about that you know <unk> you know and and i basically that's the only thing i'm i'm sorry you know so many things didn't work out and then she <unk> she said well <unk> you know and <unk> he's <unk> nice now yeah yeah i'm sorry i think didn't work out and uh put him on and then and he said well hang on just second and i heard him say well now he's there's <unk> there's something that you wanted <unk> got to do to to her and then she did <unk> tell <unk> got to get mad at him and call him and tell him to stop all this stuff and when you met any yeah well i'm like i'm living <unk> good you know and so uh so i said okay well i'll i'll give them a call but is that when you called and left a message and i think it was the next day yeah oh yeah he he called me the baby food or something like that yeah but anyway i i uh i'm not going to be man <unk> mean anyway no no okay no no not at all i've been watching my back actually yeah yeah i'm in parking the motorcycle <unk> way up close to the house for nobody will fuck with it i'm keeping an eye on it at work or made it clear to shit and <unk> and the other guys working down under that um if anybody absolutely anybody that they don't know very well happens to ask about me working there that are on doing it just for fun i'm not receiving any payment at all or what makes you think that he's going to mess with you i have no reason she's done nothing <unk> messed with recess today i've gotten there yeah but you would do anything bottle <unk> well what i'm doing <unk> maybe probably not but the thing down under is working there is actually um i guess this is on tape and stuff but it's actually if i were receiving money there <unk> yeah <unk> visa violations yeah and it's you know <unk> what i'm <unk> i'm trying to discredit them to some degree from discredit ending them in the eyes of the labor union and trying to get a they may end up having to pay a fine <unk> some kind of black with the <unk> the labor union decides in my favor right which i think they will they may have some kind of penalty or pay for that if if nothing else who has to do a lot of uh eating crow when the ministry <unk> labor comes back around and says you do have to pay pay <unk> you know it's it's all free <unk> if it goes to court i would have to pay for it but it's not going to go to court you know they're going to figure it out there i'm pretty sure it's it's so clear [laughter] so plain what happened yeah <unk> the only way it would have gone to court is if uh the obikko had lied from the word go about the circumstances being fired and they could they could have said when the ministry <unk> labor guy first came <unk> they could have said oh well we told them a month ahead of time yeah or you know <unk> if they had done that yeah then uh it would be extremely out probably have to go to court but they did they they from the word go they told the truth which surprised me that was my biggest concern but they did tell the truth about that so they're not going to get messed up we're not having paid you the food <unk> mine and all that stuff <unk> <unk> what shokko's worried about no i don't think so he didn't mention he didn't talk <unk> much detail at all but i mean i thought when i talk to you you write go for some of that too um that depends it depends on uh i i don't think there's much i can do about it you know somebody one of the guys the the ah labor unions that that's not actually a law <unk> but i think he's wrong i think just because the the ah [noise] the <unk> the guy said it is a law mhm so i think the labor union guy this isn't familiar with that but <unk> any rate i'm not going to pursue that because it turns out regardless of the law unless i went to court or all kinds of big stuff the only thing that the ministry of labor can go on is what i agreed to yeah and i i was honest with that i i i was thinking man i could go in there and sit down and say look you know i i've got this contract that says twenty five mom but i've only been getting fifteen i was thinking about doing that but i thought no i'm going to do it right i'm going to be honest yeah all i want is that last month's salary for the last month's salary i'm going to completely drop it um get on with my life which i'm doing anyway yeah well that sounds nice <unk> yeah but um [noise] it would be a little bit easier to get on with it and certain certain areas if i had that last one salary and um but i'm not hurting for money uh i've got enough yeah but i'm more is always better so [laughter] it's getting here i'm glad that you've you've got that position and all that stuff i i think you have you heard from her anyways so yeah and it's it's nice i've gotten mondays and tuesdays off now and i'm <unk> i'm going to do the occasional private class and stuff like that but uh more free time a lot less of an involved relationship with the new job <unk> you know it's going to do the classes <unk> three times a week and um so [noise] i don't think it's going to be real pleasant income this'll job last till the middle of the summer then i'm gonna have to find something else uh-huh but that's three and a half months away some things will damn sure come up by then yeah [noise] so the unity what goes on and yeah <unk> i gotta run out of here we're having i got to be at the food's oakland about fifteen minutes we're having a today classes start wednesday but today it's kind of like assembly <unk> beginning as a second uh-huh second semester and then i gotta sit down with the teachers have to be working with and let them tell me for about a half hour <unk> we're going to do and the first week of classes and that kinda stuff <unk> don't want to be laid on my first day of the job <unk> don't do that i don't think <unk> would be happy after he kinda went out on a limb and he didn't know yeah they had the sunday last sunday the day before the <unk> the sunday before the interview they had a father's cleaned up the school day and he uh he went out of his way to be cleaning up next to the uh

that and she does happen to call you again please tell her all i want is my last month's salary and i'm out of their face yeah and i'll i'll i'll completely i'll go back to the ministry <unk> labor and which is called the <unk> by the way back there i'll go back there and say look they did the right thing i'm i'm satisfied with them you know it's all <unk> so they're really concerned that's all they got to do with lay out a little bit a cat right well i i don't i don't want any part of it anyway you know i i don't i'm not going <unk> i'm not asking you to call her but she calls you you know

private tutoring swatch right <unk> <unk> i don't know i don't know how to go but i'm going to have to ask around <unk> don't know how to do these things that must be something yeah because he really wants right now i mean the thing is it because he doesn't you know like <unk> now taking correspondence course 'cause his <unk> his high school education in the middle 'cause they didn't have enough boys are interested in not enough money whatever so he had hopefully gonna finish your degree with correspondence but he knows english knows how to write and read it well he can he can read you know he's he's <unk> you know he can do it's just very snow is writing is atrocious but <unk> you know but he's not what you would expect <unk> mhm <unk> because he only had the summer <unk> yeah but how big it is good and that <unk> i don't know how you go about close bond that you do everything on your own yeah see that's the problem it's you know they have <unk> send you the books that are [noise]

answers now there are some essay questions but the question is if it was you know if he really has no english back when i think it will be very difficult for him to do it like the geography and the history and literature and i'm a psychology there was some you know different courses that had <unk> bensi doesn't need the you know he had two years of credit so he just had to finish off two more years well i mean they have like four years to do it with and he's talking about high school right but he had plenty of time you know he's <unk> when it comes back mhm mhm yeah well maybe <unk> look <unk> could be maybe dina could find out about someone that would be willing to you know how <unk> you know i can even do something i can i can find out what it means the group <unk> group <unk> send

she's a bathroom nieces age your british gonna look it up now it's on life <unk> life <unk> life is one of the cable channels right yeah <unk> and it starts at eight o'clock we're not sure we got a we just started getting that they they change the package and that's one of the free ones they give you a on ours but anyway <unk> put in for the kids oh okay see if you get a life because life has <unk> at eight o'clock has that special and jessica savage and then there's a one hour documentary on her life after that you know she was born and raised in atlantic city <unk> no i never knew where i think she's bernice says age uh she worked for a as a she worked for w. p. g. down there but from what i read about her she never uh not too many people knew her the time because she <unk> she was very a career oriented she was like a workaholic all through life is that right yeah she's beautiful i don't know if you remember her she's absolutely gorgeous beautiful and but she died and i uh uh what seemed to be an accident but now the the people that knew where <unk> she was on cocaine from the local broadcasters the newer you know so she had been taking drugs all along but you never know that she was a workaholic and really very very very attractive woman you know but uh but anyway so what else is no yeah well let's see our construction has started oh yeah how's the how's that problem you had with now expensive butter sauce yeah now you're <unk> very expensive yeah <unk> involving tremendous amount of money but uh yeah so are you are thinking assuming the person that the around <unk> him <unk> the lawyers seem <unk> think it's not really um you know not not <unk> not very happy about really are you're making out with your <unk> your oh uh my case uh uh he's trying <unk> are always trying to get phil's lawyer to get together with the lawyer for index futures and see if they can come up with a settlement but so far no he says typically settlements are like when the very last day you know on the you're sitting on the steps waiting for the judge and that's when they settle you know but <unk> and then when you go into court or well it'll he thinks it's gonna be postponed originally i was telling you was october sixteenth mhm now he thinks it more than likely you won't be till sometime in the middle of december <unk> she's tried to keep a date open we'll <unk> we'll try to let you know what the data because he he he really would prefer to either have your there otherwise he'll videotape you are but now he's er he's thinking it'll probably be delayed till i don't know he sat delayed yet but the but <unk> but the brokerage house isn't answering the questions he asks does is he still as confident that there'll be some sort of a well he's <unk> he's very confident that we'll win against phil but he's not sure that we'll win against index futures because he said this as far as he can see there's no real precedent for that britain extra for this particular case he there's no president but phil's lawyer was probing around and saying well what are you really want you know so he said see we don't want to settle with phil's lawyer prior to settling with index futures you know what i mean it seems index futures <unk> deep pocket yeah yeah so he doesn't want to settle with him for <unk> said to phil's lawyer said why don't you go get together with index futures or by the way they got a new lawyer they went outside now they're not using the running lawyer or they went outside to another firm in chicago and so he said to him go get together with him and see what you guys can come up with you know the meantime they're bringing <unk> two experts so we gotta bring an expert too that's gonna cost a few thousand dollars <unk> the expert is to say see you <unk> do you have to pay that are that come out of the summer uh i pay the expenses <unk> the expert you got this thing already must have ten thousand dollars <unk> already well not not much not not so much a thirty five hundred for him the lawyer <unk> and so foreign expenses maybe maybe a fifteen hundred so far you know but the but the big expense would be this uh expert next we gotta fly him from chicago probably put up overnight and pay <unk> how do you find an expert like that i don't know he's gonna find them he asked me if i knew anyone i didn't uh because there's no commodities experts in philly most of them are in chicago or possibly new york or washington but mostly chicago or anyway he said he'll try to find one and actually want someone who works for a commodities firm and there's a possibility they're all in cahoots together you know <unk> just think <unk> think that they don't testify against each other for the butter yeah but see they're bringing <unk> two experts to say that it's common business practice to give those they admit that they gave phil those internal printouts but they said it's common business practice <unk> give them to substantial customers but on the one hand they're arguing the army but he's just told me that she can get that program with a girl on it or you can't yes it's on life yeah so jessica savage it's on eight to ten <unk> thinking hour after that as a documentary she must be pretty famous person <unk> she died she was i don't know she was probably in her forties or something at ride fifties maybe but uh but anyway she uh she was already you know big time she was with a network she was with n._b._c. she going off the local news on to the uh she really made a big time yeah and then she uh died she was in a restaurant which we've been to a new hope you know not far and ah it's actually very tricky wee wee when when i heard about the accent i realize that it could easily happen there was a um oh i forget what it was there was a very tricky turn and when you leave the restaurant and they failed to make that turn and figure out what <unk> i forget exactly how she died it's a result of it you know but but i remember that too and i said you know i always get got confused when i left that restaurant that ah you could easily make a bad turn but anyway um i guess it was her boyfriend that was driving and uh i don't i can't remember the details anymore but they <unk> that's how she got killed you know but anyway <unk> you <unk> feel for fifteen minutes <unk> that'll <unk> because it's going to go in and about three minutes [laughter] so if you wanted to see i don't know fifteen minutes we got to be honest with you <unk> yeah yeah <unk> <unk> what else is new ah so are you getting ready for mondays affair right yeah yeah we send our last saturday we we have to like uh we we still didn't make the reservations with a a hotel we have to do after we are going to say also yeah other than that let's see what else <unk> not too well oh god yeah she she's not too well and uh we we spoke to jackie last week um she won her case you know she's getting unemployment columbus judy won hers too but the guy is appealing it he's what she judy had also won her case for unemployment but they're appealing it take the firms appealing it i'll be stomach but <unk> mean <unk> really yeah but the meantime judy got a job so they're only talking about like six weeks worth of checks you know you gotta let me ask you a question does she have hospitalization this new job ah yeah but they're so far they haven't specifically told her what she got she has to pay for part of it which is typical nowadays most companies don't give you a full hospitalization but we're going to start changing too it's it's so damn extent yeah most companies are making the employees pick up a you know to half of it or whatever and i just finished you know remember i i got a one time job with yeah bernice delaware and that works out real nice <unk> enjoyed every every minute of it and i uh i went up there and turned it over to them um last thursday great and then they're going to call and they were gonna call me and for <unk> uh and uh i i suppose how the review goes i don't know who's going to be there to deliver with me they say typically they make you redo some of it you know or whatever they make you spend more time on it but that was <unk> that was real nice <unk> enjoyed it and and it was nice money <unk> time spent so far i haven't received a money but i you know i think ah i think uh um i don't have any fears about that oh that's great that's that's if you get a few more of those yeah ouchies <unk> where did you work do it at home my own computer ah it was real nice i mean i really well mostly wasn't even computer work who was mostly i'm just my thoughts getting <unk> thought that it was something i had done before it m._c._i. and western union and my friends that <unk> they wanted and uh so i you know something i felt very comfortable with and i already did the uh the project i mean i they just wanted a specification for someone else to program and i like right up the specification i grew up uh oh about thirty four pages <unk> very detailed flow charts <unk> which isn't exactly what he wanted <unk> put <unk> the other <unk> but the guy um they can either <unk> <unk> <unk> turns it over to he just had me spend an afternoon explaining it to him and he didn't seem opposed to the way i did it and my friend said he's the fussiest guy i'd have to worry about and he seemed okay so now it's um just a few other managers there they're going to you know get together probably hung me back again and explain it again tell me what's happened to garrett's interview oh well we're real hopeful he tomorrow we probably will find out more he has to potential jobs potential teaching jobs for one is um pleasantville new jersey which we're not too happy about 'cause it's black and it's very rough but they're the ones who ah called them back for a second interview and they said it was narrowed down to four people <unk> well so he has a one out of four chance i guess but uh the the town is all black you know the early in the city and it's <unk> it's pleasantville new jersey it's like it's like it's all black and it's it's it's tough it's a tough school so uh it would be nice for him to get the experience you know he wouldn't necessarily live there but i on the other hand might not be great experience the other one is edison new jersey but they <unk> we don't like about that is that's a nicer area probably but uh and it's only a couple of hours from here he'd have to relocate either way but the edison uh the guy keeps changing his story at first he was talking about permanent position then he's saying well they're trying to get rid of one teacher they have and if they're not able to get rid of that teacher he would be more of a long term sub <unk> him <unk> say changed the story from the first times of the second time anyway he's supposed to hear from both of them tomorrow and uh if he gets the i think if you get the pleasantville job he might take it because it is a regular fulltime job even <unk> might not be the great great school but it depends what they come back with edison too so tomorrow <unk> we'll see if you can survive the pleasantville job it's certainly a great uh on your resume yeah <unk> yeah that was <unk> was a fulltime teacher and anytime you can look for others everybody in the schools black everybody that interview was born <unk> black <unk> yeah so that's like uh just about a totally black community now and anyway the more <unk> hears about the community and more <unk> hears it's not so great it's not not as bad as the big city black areas that don't you're not living like no no he's live you know live somewhere nearby you know maybe in a harbor or uh you know <unk> could be we we drive through pleasantville driving down to atlantic city yeah when you take the black horse pike you're passing right through pleasantville <unk> worth <unk> friday yeah you probably passed through it it from the road you can't tell anything you know you see a bunch of bird burger kings and things like that but the community itself i think has become pretty much play well probably know what i'm saying waiting for the highlander <unk> really terrible and then uh the other thing is uh uh well innocent and i think it would be a nicer community uh we don't know much about it but uh but <unk> it's all gonna be last minute that they hire him they're gonna want i'm like right away so he put on the verge of them now or are these are the end of the you know reading it right away they were talking about this it's <unk> like the last minute thing at both places are there <unk> the <unk> the kids just went back to school or going back to school tomorrow and he's supposed to find out tomorrow <unk> what am i talking about <unk> school starts tomorrow night but that's when they want <unk> like right away you know so ah so i don't know i don't know why this all happened last minute but that's what they both <unk> them for like they they're short of teacher against <unk> something <unk> <unk> working <unk> will micha like doing some jobs on his own or we soon yeah that working out pretty well he's been pretty busy i i really don't have any idea what kind of money he's <unk> he's getting but he's been fairly busy but you know it's dry spells and not to address those right now he's been you know pretty busy so i'm hopefully he can build that up making it more you know around here <unk> teams of course we're right now i'm down the king <unk> around here <unk> every single place you looking for looking for a breakfast this morning <unk> the instructor breakfast and <unk> but i think was a manager store cleaning up the tables mhm not just a young man but working hard so i said you know just a franchise because you said the problem <unk> money they don't want to work mhm yeah <unk> that's exactly the probably having a store to write a few of them are good mhm <unk> <unk> we actually have kids from the catholic school we find that gives us a better much better <unk> work ethics and yeah there's more just <unk> you know and uh all right so we're we're back to the show maybe fifteen

that's what i that's what i have to do it on <unk> oh see i didn't do it on fire well what i do like impose and then to send it i have to do this last session and then it takes very little time yeah now of course i'm charged for a minute anyway because that's the minimum long distance yeah go the heat thing let it better than another one where he thinks that you maybe you don't have to do the long distance thing i i haven't found that that i've been looking to believe me i will because a lotta people are going on line and then i have to actually go on line to retrieve my messages i can yeah you have to be on line <unk> you <unk> i can read them off in other words they'll kind of you know what you <unk> leave them on line but then turn off the last <unk> i like to actually print them

[laughter] [laughter] [laughter] no i don't know i know what are your plans for october i was thinking a little bit about coming out to see you if you had any time would be great i just can't think of anything <unk> and <unk> got to start thinking about thanksgiving and cruise [laughter] no it's not going to be about here before you know i can't believe subways over oh i can't either i mean it's so hot here i am the energy to do any all that's the way it's bad here just [noise] i just i just could hardly function this i'm in fact i did very little work around the house because it was just too hot really didn't hit us to know about <unk> <unk> ice with all suburb damn <unk> we had a nice cool spring and we've got hot in august but not the you know mhm nice breeze in the afternoon <unk> <unk> you know it's just hot mhm it's hot <unk> would you go to bed and it's hot [laughter] [noise] well now i evenings have beginning to cool off we're getting like down to the sixties and sometimes fifties doing the nine <unk> which makes it really nice oh and the days are beginning to be more comfortable they're still getting up to high eighties or nineties but this summer you'd open the back door and it was just like something hit you in the face you know i just could not breathe in this hot weather <unk> was just terrible he's been running over a hundred yeah a couple of days here but of course we don't have quite the humidity mhm back there which helps right yes i think it's the humidity that really makes it hard <unk> was that unusual at this time of year to be so hard i don't know it really is and it just doesn't usually last so long i'm a few very hot days in a kind of cool off a little bit but you know usually every year when school starts it's hot it gets hot right not all the <unk> air conditioner <unk> you feel sorry for <unk> oh i know i said i was just so thankful i wasn't going back this year 'cause i could well as i say it's it has started to moderate a little bit but those first few days it was so hot i don't know how they do it it it's really bad i'm not sure <unk> today <unk> first day oh really where they've been probably week and a half here in school i haven't seen her on estefan while they okay you know the last i heard i know i talked to him for three weeks ago <unk> we we went into him once in awhile eating out someplace that we haven't seen him for probably six months or so misleading decent place [laughter] they still eat out they they go out every morning for breakfast oh do they <unk> you know what a nice thing i've ever since he retired but get <unk> get some out and get some going i think i think that's nice yeah <unk> usually go out again for dinner uh-huh we eat out almost every night that i'm killing as a worker that she goes out with the worker to eat and i know it's just gotten to the place it's just easier for us to eat out as it is to try to cook at home uh teams you know what he's doing that and you got a house we bought a different house down the street and we're still in the process of trying to get somebody to live here with her maybe two other handicapped girls to live in this house with her [noise] and we're going to be having a meeting soon to talk about it again but then you know worked out yeah we don't have it in in in place yet but the s. c. where who has gaelin's program is in favor of it and um they're you know they are are starting to [noise] uh talk about it and make plans but it's awfully slow but at least they are they are considering it now and it may not work i don't know it it gets awfully confining but <unk> <unk> to it a lot and most of the time she's pretty cooperative and uh hopefully it will work out because i don't know what the option to be otherwise it just depends if we can find the right person you know to to stay with it and just now again it seems like you know so many people are <unk> and they just don't wanna work oh that's true and you can't have anybody either that's right <unk> it's going to take a special person so it's good if you have to other handicap people um once you need more than one or not i still would like to see killing continue their program she's in where she would go out you know in the evening with <unk> because she looks forward to that so much in that gives her some socialization and <unk> keeps in touch with the community and really just make today um and i i don't know you know there's still a lot we need to to think about and <unk> has she been in a program where she works during the day <unk> yes uh-huh she still does now why uh-huh yeah she she goes out to d. s. c. and so she leaves the house about seven thirty and gets home about three thirty [noise] and hopefully we can find somebody that would just live in and be like a house parrot and then maybe have relief you know one or two days a week for them so uh and i just feeling this the sizes town is that once we we really have things set in place so we know what we could offer somebody your work out because <unk> see it first week <unk> came home you know they said they wouldn't be able to find people to work with it well you know we do and so i just feel i guess weather's weather's a will there's a way yeah well <unk> takes a lotta work but it takes a lot of patience you like you had that well it's [laughter] sometimes i wonder anymore <unk> i need more than what i have [laughter] don't we all and [noise] and i i hope to really put <unk> energy into it you know what i would love to see you and october if you can come out <unk> were you thinking of come well right now i don't have much um i've got a dentist appointment i think it's october nineteenth but other than that <unk> october <unk> pretty open right now so really wanted to check <unk>

have a community health plan mhm and he said okay well then you probably need to speak to someone at harvard to just go right and i'd rather do that i don't want to talk to the doctors right i want to say to them who who authorizes surgery anyway mhm you know do you tell the doctor's okay this guy already had one surgery so where everything you can you can you hear me yeah you know i mean what are they say do they say you know do everything you can for the guy but do you know try to avoid surgery at all costs uh-huh or does the doctor the one that make the call because they were really rude to a gym at the end those doctors were <unk> they just said look i tell you there's nothing we can do for you yeah and that's it you know so now get outta my face exactly well that's what i told her i

you it's it's so important like i said you were like well that's what i mean really really bussing out of our apartment <unk> <unk> it's a one bedroom apartment them and <unk> the living room right we're reluctant to leave because we're such good neighbors so close you know we've been together already three four years right right you know they're all <unk> became at the same time and they're very very good friends <unk> have you ever need a babysitter when you have to run film or we need a car you know it's it's it's <unk> neighbors <unk> such a yeah or wasn't stupid when she tried those calls <unk> relationship when the road [laughter] she was doing she thought that was just come and go round will help us [laughter] that's really <unk> those things so but that's what <unk> said <unk> own <unk> this is rob oh i'll try to be best friends was brown oh really i don't know she was weird because if she wants to make sure that they're not just come and get <unk> she's going to take care of us live like that these people know wow but that's something else i mean we're like yeah whatever [laughter] you know i'm thinking about being protected i don't know but just like in terms of communal stuff is very nice <unk> without family <unk> very very important <unk> so that's very good and the kids are mama shouldn't have and it's like it's heaven for kids they run outside all day long the person that's really cool you know they can't you know <unk> <unk> all year long let me go and they pick up six and they have <unk> you don't even have to watch them much because everybody for them right there i mean you don't have to watch them <unk> i mean well the big kids you don't have to watch his his no danger <unk> no cars there's nowhere you call <unk> american <unk> <unk> you know exactly exactly so and and you know whatever <unk> and the little kids i mean like <unk> even have to watch because he said you know <unk> but it's still like he he has freedom like you know if i'm just stay on the street and i just watch 'em we rent back and forth and his little cars are or you know whatever <unk> or something so he's you know but <unk> <unk> in terms of naturally like what <unk> it's really a good life for kids it's it's really really been very healthy life for them like they're very very happy and i'm probably the only one that suffers little from it danny sefer <unk> from it i'm suffering just from like that whole move was done so crazy like you know <unk> arrived on the tuesday morning we moved on a friday <unk> started work on monday for a while and <unk> was just <unk> yeah yeah it was just such hell and um and then i got sick and then you know like i just called in twice already sick like and it's such a short term and they've just realized that i'm not making enough money and so i have to because <unk> <unk> yeah transportation subtract transportation <unk> like eighty canadian dollars [laughter] you know like <unk> though so uh you know have to start looking into supplementing in looking into like teaching these eighteen year old programs 'cause like they're the only ones that pay anything 'cause you know like ten thousand dollar american programs <unk> wherever they're bringing money they can pay money yeah yeah when you pay they pay ten thousand dollars a year each <unk> each of these kids like of course they can have money to pay that's what i'm trying to say that like that <unk> places they know it's all fundraising so they don't have any money that was <unk> big enough to do even though it's not as kids aren't as motivated buddy means right about the insurance if you're a cashier ashville that's the bottom lawn lawn right i'm going to have your own out what the right exactly so it's a it's a bit of a problem now though because it's <unk> yeah you know it's like the year everybody started then i have to try and do like you know <unk> the trinity leave and then for things like that like you know substitution which anyway you probably have to do just to like get on the inside because it's all these schools are very over gla did with teachers um and so it's very competitive so it's <unk> it's only they know you and and <unk> speaks english is supposed to get a job right or like generally there's so many people in you know i'm <unk> <unk> you know here that are qualified <unk> yeah so they it's it's hard to it's hard to get a job like unless you have a reputation or you you know somebody <unk> you know so uh so i anyway the only way to like penetrated it's like with a with a connection and then with like proving yourself like you know if you do on maternity leave or whatever it is you know and then they'll hire you for the next year you know uh so we're we'll and started a a seminary oh really yeah um let's like like <unk> with more <unk> <unk> so um we're leaving slowly for the right and <unk> just a little different ones um i don't know if it's to the right <unk> well i would say to the right amount a lot but it's like has more of a direction like you know like a certain uh uh-huh whom that i'm a law does like you know just a collection of teachers <unk> this one is like more of a you know more like a more like homogeneous i guess i see so uh but at the same kind of style place but um so i have a friend who's a who's teaching there and i'm gonna try and like you know smoking <unk> get on me and you never know <unk> like the truth is is that i taught one year <unk> seminary here <unk> child but like the girls weren't the best <unk> what else <unk> not one of the best right it's like you know like all these girls on the prospect one it's a no that's um and all they want <unk> i don't know <unk> <unk> yeah this is what else <unk> like all sorts of um [noise] i happened to get like the highest class but they had like <unk> why kids that come there and all kinds of stuff i mean they're mentally coming for the year <unk> israel not really <unk> yeah they're not really and and i it was like a nightmare like i hated <unk> gonna stand going into school and i said i'm never going to teach in one of these again but the truth is is that like if you get to a um if you go to one of these places like that are more motivated like <unk> or like <unk> were woman's but he's already come you know like a more motivated to learn so that is way half of the problem you know <unk> i'm joel yeah you i guess you know yeah you gotta try it and if it really doesn't go really doesn't go below <unk> i'll i'll try it i think after the game like i'm gonna get into that i go right now i'm just trying to like get better and i'm trying to write <unk> get the house <unk> own path unpacked like it's not so i don't have <unk> i i wouldn't have closets <unk> though i didn't like ah well you know how you have to buy closets here you know <unk> i'm very expensive here they kill us ridiculous like pieces of junk <unk> unbelievable million dollars i don't know why furniture so expensive there maybe because <unk> small market and now it's just made <unk> <unk> what are we talking about <unk> <unk> <unk> it's garbage garbage garbage furniture <unk> you pay nothing for because because it's mass produce right here this <unk> market is so small that uh yeah that you can't produce in the same volume so you know you have to charge more so um but in any case whatever i guy i was going to make sure i'm like all the time to try and look for <unk> and he's like an hand stores you know like i said i bought one thinks versus <unk> yes off one for four hundred shekel that's two hundred dollars <unk> two hundred dollars <unk> not so bad but uh but uh i i at a certain point like i was going so crazy from going in getting heat stroke looking for these things like you know on top of everything else and i just said i'm going to tell us even went to like the furniture district and i just bought a new one and there's <unk> there's <unk> <unk> that's what it was it was like seven hundred shekel <unk> time all was all over right yeah yeah like what time it gets here and it's uh it will be seven hundred shekel like uh i just like i wrote a hundred shekel deposit and a half there were like right the rest <unk> diving until the next the next day <unk> should <unk> ah well i'm i'm <unk> how are you having enough for her at all and <unk> and his the he's having a very very hard time with my time 'cause i'm i'm like [noise] i don't know it's uh i don't know if it's like <unk> it's a whole combination of things like <unk> viable product or or i think he has viable product <unk> there's a few things i think he has viable product but i think that he's not like a fundraiser organizer type <unk> um anything like from the beginning if he'd had a person that was like <unk> ah type with him and then they would have been okay but i like the truth is is that all the people that worked with them initially were like <unk> like you know like danny and they are sort of i mean you know yeah active creative and all that but not like the battle he'll down to earth ah you know money <unk> and like you know <unk> maybe <unk> higher money minded guy for this so you know what i mean yeah so the problem is though that beyond like <unk> so beyond that financially now that they can hire anybody so while you'll have you'll have to so to speak of raises old salary i mean well that's <unk> yeah it's been happening but it's very very <unk> like you know what <unk> the little bit comes in here a little bit comes in there you know but uh like a lot of the thing the people that you know we approached in toronto delayed promise and then people don't follow through you almost have to follow up was one thing you know yeah no but like even when you follow up and then they say well you know we're gonna be in israel like after the game and now it's like <unk> and and and yeah well we'd like to you know start a project in a few months from now i send the meantime and and a lot of them he couldn't afford to keep on a lot of this stuff and <unk> and all that stuff left and and so he's there on his own with all this stuff is a very very very difficult so he's he's struggling like crazy and uh you know then on top of it is like in the middle of nowhere here stranded like uh we thought that it was every half hour we're right near kiryat sefer still like everybody's telling us at the buses from period safer go out every half hour and you know more and more service but it's like every half hour during rush hour like eight and five but for like three for an hour or two at a time like but you know that you can <unk> the day where like for three hours <unk> know but <unk> also can be real period so yeah and like until you get <unk> the bus goes through kiryat save her and then it goes into <unk> like until you get into you should limit secondn our rights not forty minutes so it's a lot of time and <unk> yeah and then like you feel then doesn't have to get the truth is danny you know is in town so it's not such a big deal to give them <unk> town but for me like get <unk> get very hard enough after that <unk> that but <unk> mean and then next it's like an hour and a half you know just for her so ah so that's a real and they also have to go and walked into curious safer like it's also will walk like a fifteen twenty minute walk in the blistering sun so wild saudis as far as that goes <unk> mean commuting goes it's really not immune goes it's not easy like now i'm trying to get a it's also the beginning you don't know yeah <unk> around once your life pick on some some routine it'll <unk> things will get easier because you have to like you <unk> you have to do you have to be in the know like you have to find out about you know who goes into and <unk> and the transit and all that yeah so i've just found out or or ride that goes <unk> like seven ten in the morning like i can get to work with it so you know and danny's found something like three times a week or like a ride in at the time that he needs to get the <unk> i think with time a lot on things <unk> will be able to some of the kinks right right <unk> it's just ah you know until then it's like a <unk> it's crazy <unk> little bit ah so ah yeah so we're like you know there's a lot of things stupid things like there's no screens on the windows and it's such <unk> all <unk> and <unk> and probably to buy screens costs so much yeah and then you had to make you know you have to make the aluminum for the whole thing <unk> <unk> i haven't gotten a call yet i'm sort of afraid to but like danny goes crazy with these things he hates dogs whatever you know like he bought some screen that been like in the hardware store and just like taped it keeps them coming out and whatever i'm not something <unk> you know so these kind of and it'll <unk> little logistical things that hopefully with time will get our and all but at this point there though they drive you crazy <unk> here like <unk> were very uh <unk> that humid human dry it's really hot and humid <unk> <unk> for <unk> hand that's for sure not <unk> like eight thousand shekel like that yeah that makes sense if i'm watching a thousand shekel yeah <unk> that's a three thousand dollars right american yeah it did they have assistance <unk> eating or air conditioning yeah what i'm saying but we can you can get your wall unit for four dollars right well i didn't hear <unk> hung out here <unk> we're going to get ceiling fans and stuff <unk> important when you're in an apartment you have <unk> yeah that makes a difference i'm sure it does have a special too but it's a short hair conditioning supposed to go to <unk> cools the place though right right <unk> don't know <unk> summer here oh you weren't drop and you know it's like right but i've never been in like what is worse like it's worse right really <unk> yeah and it's humid right <unk> <unk> you know <unk> it's funny and other than <unk> i never liked the fan didn't really make the make a difference yeah but they're dry here but like with with wet air it really made a fan really does make it really makes it so <unk> you know it's a different seems <unk> would be a nice enough <unk> totally totally without the fan we couldn't sleep and then danny like didn't want the windows open because of the because of bugs over and then the <unk> closing and so the sun was meeting <unk> would like <unk> and when it came in seemed like it was awful the first few days are awful awful but ah yeah we have we're <unk> we're trying to get set up with the fans and stuff but ah you know like until you get anything done they send us the wrong part and it's hard you know we're borrowing now are <unk> and then we have another fan that's broken and <unk> you know like ah whatever the whole thing so whatever until it gets i figure not like until the game it's not going to be like that it's not going to be together lead lead ride anyway right i see so anyway that's the full yeah reports and now you can uh film <unk> what <unk> mean <unk> my i guess our little puck was like a our car just what <unk> oh no don't okay that's life it's it's gone on i'm not really worth it to fix <unk> <unk> right so you have <unk> buy new i'm looking for a new car so we can do like shmieler dinner or no no i don't think <unk> <unk> <unk> you didn't get the what happened <unk> logistical problems also for the simple american canada and insurance and all the different laws it's you know i don't know he's being a he's a miserable miserable would
