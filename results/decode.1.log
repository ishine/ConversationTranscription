doing <unk> french and german and all different <unk> really they're really going to record this really going to use it for something or yeah i guess so i'm i'm my guess is that just either for doing some sort of speech recognition systems are for computers or for building up um there's a feel <unk> computational linguistics where they look at the properties of languages what the probabilities of our various kinds of words occurring together and such um and all that <unk> yeah yeah <unk> what it's for and they needed <unk> anyway thank you very much for your for your notes heart and your and your photo <unk> couple of weeks ago and i don't know what she's coming along [laughter] yeah she's a big girl yeah and how are your grandkids well pretty good are they both are going <unk> did you didn't have the second one yeah yeah she the second one in march and so he's about three months old wow and his name is about <unk> <unk> that's nice and he's a nice boy he's <unk> he's coming along and of course patrick is talking and walking and er how old is he now he's too well he was he was a middle of june <unk> second birthday so he's a big boy and he's doing all kinds of things that people do when they're too yeah like being disagreeable and asserting independent <unk> most of the time yeah yeah but um you know saying things and being kind of funny and uh walking around and uh just being nice nice little boy that's neat <unk> <unk> what and she's happy oh she's fine yeah um you know the apartments a little bit smaller and stuff and they could you know we could use this and use that but um oh sure she's fine yeah yeah huh how you doing where fine um what else is just beginning to get more <unk> because she can walk now and um well she's what how old a ten month but she she that that's very early <unk> yes hands cousin my are nice not sam sister's best his cousin sam sister's kid i'm also walked at nine months so she's been walking for about five weeks now [laughter] oh that's an and i can climb stairs she climbs on chairs and you know we have to know a lot more now yeah and she remembers thing so we can't distract her as easily anymore so she's had little <unk> a temper tantrum and things like if she was she was on rolling all the toilet paper [laughter] she just thought this wonderful [laughter] was that i didn't let it anyway [laughter] and she just put her hands on her hips and started crying and she had this power and <unk> we've had a few of those this week oh started so but then she <unk> she doesn't go life is tough but yeah i know getting <unk> were were breaking her spirit early or a girl my goodness [laughter] oh so you the number of words now um [noise] yeah it surprises me i like the other day i said do you want to go upstairs and change it and get a clean diaper or something like that and she stopped what she was doing and whenever the stairs and i don't know what piece of that she understood diaper stairs or what are some things are getting through and she um school has said her first word which was kitty kitty cat um our cat you know i don't know that <unk> that it's a general word it's sort of a proper now uh-huh uh and she's all all of a sudden i'm after months of saying pet the kiddy gently and showing her house she's petting her gently instead of just grabbing her and try and put her in her mouth [laughter] so [laughter] when did you get to be your uh august twenty fourth mostly for say yeah end of august yeah she's a heritage and determined <unk> that's nice yeah she's very headstrong um her daycare people say whenever there's a conflict between the two kids and to get a daycare that's always wins and even though she's much smaller than these other kids she's just very focused and very determined <unk> well she doesn't cry she doesn't look at another kid she just goes for the toy that they're holding you know and <unk> until she gets it and then the not nice part of this that i'm sure will get better river age i hope and she'll play with the <unk> as long as the other kids interested and when they're no longer interested she throws it away [laughter] so there's a little militia side than here yeah [laughter] um [noise] uh well i don't know yeah [laughter] and where to get to a analytical about it i've seen yeah the kids were through terrible things when they were really young and they grow up to be a very different kinds of people yeah i also feel that um it's probably better this way because you can train her to not be nasty more easily right you can train a shy kid to stand up for herself right so i think she'll be okay how was your teaching going it's hectic well i'm not doing it right now i'm all for summer which <unk> <unk> but i mean i mean during the year during the <unk> i found it much more difficult with beth i'm <unk> i i'm treated much more as a job instead of my life now yeah it's no longer the central thing but my mum was um a course in normal language acquisition being taught to students um of communicative who were majoring in communicative disorders so they're students who are going to go on and practice and um so they're not very theoretically oriented their applied oriented and um they're not as good as my students at san diego yeah um but they can learn you know it was a writing intensive course and all of these kids they were under grads but they have to go to graduate practice you can't um mhm you can't practice without a masters so they knew they had to go to graduate school so they really did work very hard they knew they had to get in the mid term almost all of them had season d's um and so they pulled it up they work very very hard and that was really <unk> um i'll have to teach two courses instead of one in the fall no i'm not looking forward to that um but it's okay i'm my research has slowed down tremendously and that's bothering me a little more and i'm trying to right over the summer but i've got about five papers to write and i'll probably get two and a half done and uh i would love to get a grant out but i don't know when that will be yeah not going to be the summer <unk> sam doing <unk> how's how's the college he's <unk> he's feeling okay um the colleges yeah having problems keeping it's enrollment up and so we've been a little worried that you know at one point it looked like they might lay off <unk> people and then the and they didn't do that and they're doing stupid things like um they want to start a football team which is a considerable financial investment at the same time they were talking about laying off faculty <unk> and they think that by having a football team they'll generate more interest amongst undergraduate some more enrollment and i think that a school with a population of seven hundred that's not the best way to spend your money yeah did never going to be good football team so yeah it's not <unk> that is that is amazing kind of anti intellectual well it's just it's so american it hurts yeah [laughter] it's this is a real anti intellectual environment here that's weird even among academics it's so different from anywhere i've been before um i i don't know if the rules of this uh call let me put on another caller but i figured the fifteen minute point i put sam on and he can tell you more about that yeah yeah um how are you guys <unk> chris <unk> pretty well christmas is not here at the moment she's been away with her class up in north up around blandenburg for about two weeks on uh they call <unk> medicine feldmessen is um surveying <unk> and uh so she's been away for two weeks <unk> come back tonight huh so we're looking forward to that so yeah gosh i bet you're getting lonely yeah well claudia's been here we've been we've been doing okay and i'm actually waiting for <unk> to show up because we're we're supposed to go into town and meet some people in town i've got a student here who's looking to chicken out rooms and stuff she's coming in the fall but she was in a place called <unk> while you know <unk> yeah <unk> <unk> was there she did a course into <unk> and then she came over here and um checked out a room here and so so it's i mean semester is still going <unk> of course it ends on the twenty second uh july mhm so it's a very busy yeah gosh another month and then <unk> are you coming over to the states and all this summer know well <unk> [laughter] no no no no relatives left here anymore well the relative scene is kinda sad you know everybody's kind of kind of passed away i remember when i talked to in the fall that both did your sister my sister passed away yeah i don't know if you smoke maybe for that <unk> was that was happening or when was it made them right after my father died right after we talked oh god yeah we're getting old [laughter] no i don't know what it is it's just ah people get sick and they get sick pretty young and yeah and you know my sister wasn't that old and she just just <unk> just had bad luck i guess is what even say anything anybody can do so and then an added an addict chris's aunt mamie up in maine passed away that that hadn't had had that happened already know that <unk> know she passed away in march or yeah i think there was some concern about her when i talk to you in september october know she's been she was not doing well she had a brain tumor and operated on things were going well [noise] i actually got this year i guess the day before she died <unk> mean she didn't know she didn't know that that that was yeah yeah yeah she was just not not <unk> so it was a blessing i guess but um anyway weird stuff yeah how 'bout you 'cause i don't know how your eyes well i don't know i have to go next week to see check out you know see again i i'm not exactly convinced that it's okay you know it's like i'm not i'm not sure <unk> it's been been pretty good it was about eighty percent for awhile and then i i'm i'm not exactly sure what it is now <unk> we'll i'll know a couple of it where are you having blurred vision are you oh yeah yeah <unk> right <unk> <unk> ah not so great it was it we got back <unk> about eighty percent <unk> detached retina right and then they operated on at once and the opera or twice and then <unk> things seemed seems to be seem to be doing pretty well and at the moment i'm a little i'm not sure [noise] so who knows um but you know it'll never be more than about seventy or eighty percent which is fine eighty percent <unk> i'm so we'll just we'll just see <unk> and see what happens [laughter] straight or yeah annoying and the thing that came up recently <unk> you know i had all that kind of a knee problem a couple of years ago in my right knee and that was my left me it's just you know it's just a pain yes yeah um i went to the doctor and they they too <unk> <unk> <unk> ah just the anyway they take <unk> fluid out of it uh-huh gets irritated and take some pills and stuff and it's just it's just this is is that like water on the name is that what that is um well that's what happens with develops because of irritation because of a um inflammation <unk> is that <unk> yeah maybe i mean they they they don't know mhm <unk> just came overnight practically wow um and uh we've been up in berlin and we had a big triples added a lot of lot of walking fast walking and stuff like that you know i mean that's shouldn't be be a big deal i'm was this last <unk> tuftees good what's your life <unk> students from tufts good yeah well they're still here right but they're winding down the you know that they want <unk> yeah they're very good they weren't they learned a lot of german raising my german for forget i saw george silinas <unk> don't know how that he's had well he's working for an american firm over here <unk> doing very well um that his wife just had their fourth child wow little boy benjamin yeah wow about uh two two weeks ago maybe jobs and i got a card from you remember amy gleason yeah yeah well she just had a baby a couple i think i heard that this is this is number two okay i just got <unk> card from ron and doris and they see amy gleason on occasion and so i think yeah tell me that have you heard from ron indoors another while no they are now living in rhode island you probably knew that <unk> yeah and she teaches you are yeah and it was very nice letter 'cause it sounded like she went through very similar things that i did you know i went from chicago to u._c._s._d. to hear right and it's just such an intellectual left let down and she went from penn to um be a <unk> columbia columbia's you are i yeah she said the students are just you know they don't care and they're not very good and all of a sudden she's getting conference papers rejected and she thinks it's the affiliation because she doesn't think the quality of her work it's changed now i haven't submitted a conference paper with the missouri i'm you know affiliation yet because the last one i submitted um was in the fall and i still had my sandiego affiliation um in fact i'm still officially on leave if anything came up in the next year we're going <unk> they'll go back you know for sam but i think it's very very very very unlikely but anyway it was nice to hear from her because she said after two years there now she um have come to terms with this and <unk> accepted that there's a lot of good things in rhode island and um you know their life is a lot less complicated and she has more time to be a parent and it's just not going to have the same kind of career that she had thought about ron is working as a financial consultant for a merrill lynch and all yeah he had been doing work for some environmental from as a consultant and it didn't work out he um he was changing projects every couple of weeks and he said he couldn't keep on top of it he couldn't learn <unk> whole new area that fast each time um and he said he went and had some tests name was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder which you know given how he's how far he's gotten you know it goes degree uh tufts and all i found that surprising that for the first time as an adult they're diagnosing this um i wonder about it but anyway yeah but that's what he said and um he um whatever's helpful right so he found this new job <unk> financial consultant and seems to be happy with that and <unk> saw leo and julie and <unk> the time and they're doing great um they had just using <unk> new york now right really nice house in west chester yeah <unk> know an older home that you know julie is of course carving up and making beautiful um now she had a job with an architectural group when she first got out to new york and that didn't work out she said they had her doing things that she really wasn't qualified to do and then she really didn't feel competent doing and they mutually agreed that you <unk> leave and so she was looking for another job and i'm i'm sure she'll find one she's so talented she may have family over yeah <unk> yeah yeah and so we met um [noise] uh adrian their kid who was <unk> and just really lovely little boy he's <unk> big [laughter] you know <unk> yeah [laughter] and iran and doris sent us a picture of theirs and he has ron's expressions he really looks like ron i'm really big two <unk> three and a half um but leo and julie just seemed i'm so happy with the decisions they've made and good uh where you know if he would've publishing house which <unk> which one i'm really <unk> <unk> yeah it's one of these sort of university <unk> the university <unk> brace i'm not sure oh i have two friends in publishing and maybe the other one that just took the job with hard core brace i don't remember which one anyway he's he's enjoying it and liking it and they're doing <unk> yeah he seems to feel really like he's doing the right thing and he is still in academic publishing my other friend just moved to trade publishing after years <unk> publishing and um you know <unk> feels like maybe she made a compromise but it's like three times <unk> money as with everything else with industry and academics [laughter] [laughter] i'm terrible yeah it's amazing and um you know ages ago i got a card from liz can and i told you this because uh you showed us yeah sure yeah <unk> and i keep thinking maybe i'd get in touch but i haven't done it and then i saw in the um tufts thing that ginny totta is living you know and the alumni thing is living in san francisco bay area with her two daughters and no mention of five so um i assume well they've <unk> they've been they believe me that's a long time oh a long time yeah yeah i forgot know how long it's been it's been a long time and we've lost track of kelly a camera yeah yeah i i have two yeah so i don't

man in september oh yeah september maybe end of august depending on what you know but ah probably september see i've one mile and the the numbers are down unfortunately things are really quiet and they and then the german world yeah really how many well this semester i think i'm going to go to have about nine wow seven seven undergraduates into grad so i wonder if that's because the end of the cold war uh nobody seems to know why but the interest is shifted away from germany and russia to japan and china yeah well you know very aware of that in san diego i is there any are there any programs in south america not from tough because that would <unk> people that are on program in a in spain mm mhm but um there are all kinds of programs in south america of course tops kids <unk> programs to south america and australia is very big these days don't ask me why yeah <unk> <unk> foreign language right it's english is far away and uh who knows huh so that's uh you know some concern about these things that <unk> but last year england was way way down and this year they're up again france fluffy they're all sorts of reading a lot and um there's some concern yeah <unk> oh i have a acts up it's such a yeah hey i tell everybody what a great program it was you know when i enter view the students for tops i always try to encourage them to think about too yeah i do a lot i do <unk> how did <unk> people you would have you did they go to <unk> i i andrew <unk> oh okay i don't know what their final decisions are they don't tell me that they just you know who the people i interview they accept this year they accepted all the ones they interviewed boy i just interviewed such a talented crop this you know <unk> ridiculous they were and the thing that you would <unk> better than anyone i'd ever interviewed in california i gave me made me think okay best can go to school here i was being very condescending about her going to school in the mid west before that but they were just <unk> it's a self selecting process and the people who apply to places like tufts new applied a whole bunch of other good places and the problem is that they go you know some people go to <unk> put a lot of people go other place yeah i think that's what you <unk> you know i think for the very best uh for i did her first choice was not tough i think it was somewhere like carleton um for the the worst one i interviewed and she was actually wait listed her first choice was tough and then the other two one was interested in brown as well as tops and i don't know about the third the the other guy so they were all really interesting kids [laughter] no i get the same i get a lot a lot of very very good people apply to toss okay let me run and get <unk> doesn't get annoyed with any that he doesn't get any <unk> you know okay may redo this and his name because we could each do at once you may get another call from us and then not distant future <unk> you have to wait for them to register him [laughter] okay okay <unk> actually <unk> by by by [noise] [noise] [noise] hi i'm sam how are you <unk> quite a gimmick <unk> pretty good how are you going <unk> it's very very hot here oh and i'm sort of amazing for for these parts i'm so everybody's kind of <unk> running around and suffering around <unk> but um yeah it must be like you know <unk> and when <unk> got here it's like the end of the world are you doing with <unk> oh i'm tired [laughter] yeah henry and leroy semester really had to do committee work it's interesting that first year you sort of you're happy you have a job stuff goes well then the second you're figure out what's wrong and you figure it's not that hard to fix it and i suspect in another year or so i'll be used to the fact that you can fix [laughter] but um yeah i'm still can really work takes takes an enormous amount of time and uh probably wonder sometimes whether it's all worth it [noise] will <unk> especially when you're you drink communities where you're supposed to be doing something but then the next generation goes and does something entirely so you've wasted your time entirely uh so it's it's a little frustrating but <unk> it's it's it's it's not any worse here than anywhere else it's just nope nope just to shock <unk> yeah [laughter] but um i have a student who are actually i haven't had him in a class but uh he's gonna go tubing and and uh i guess ninety six ninety seven on the road <unk> scholarship <unk> good for him <unk> is it a guy or yeah yeah <unk> yes <unk> you know or [noise] um yeah uh what's his name uh josh breaking <unk> know josh josh will <unk> will <unk> will be <unk> yeah you are you <unk> <unk> yeah okay good okay <unk> well for him yeah yeah it's <unk> tool <unk> not affecting your it'll be the fall fall of ninety six yeah that'd be wild so he knows already that he's got <unk> yeah well you haven't got the official letter but he's <unk> he's been selected from <unk> missouri area so it's good <unk> great it's great because he he didn't have enough money to go he was thinking he really wanted to go but he was giving up until after <unk> finished school and then go for a trip and i talked to remember walking into this 'cause i knew i knew you had a transcript uh-huh oh no figured it's competition in this area wouldn't be the top so uh-huh <unk> were <unk> that's <unk> that's good yeah free when you feel like you can actually accomplished <unk> yeah [laughter] a concrete thing you know even say i i really yeah that's one of the nice things about this job really <unk> these <unk> these <unk> <unk> <unk> my senior year [laughter] [noise] um you know it's with the nice things about this <unk> this jog or you know you can do things that you really see you know things really happen you know you write a letter somebody gets into graduate school or or um or you know whatever you do hear on the scene i mean she sort of you know day to day by day is like like building like being a carpenter [laughter] when you get a really sort of concentrated your good students and i uh yeah yeah and stuff they're doing really really changed their lives in in in the students are immediately aware of it yeah well that's what i end up doing slow and long term [laughter] definitely definitely yeah you know the uh some vice president from tufts showed up here the other day and get a little talking <unk> quite a nice guy actually <unk> good good talker he um he's someone who is who was teaching i think engineering and he's moved into this area and this area and now he's moving up the the <unk> things are <unk> wrong <unk> know ministry of stuff yeah and um you know i think the one day you'll probably be a college president somewhere i mean i think that's what sort of on his mind and and uh it's very very nice person and really a lot a lot going for him but just different priorities different things that were important for um and i think that the power to a certain extent and maybe i don't know exactly different kinds of problems yeah and um maybe <unk> you know having more of the big picture and stuff where people who were teaching or running a program or everybody gets a tied <unk> sort of a small little corner thinks that corner is kind of the beginning of the end world without him <unk> yeah <unk> it's very interesting i i uh uh but i'm very happy doing what i'm doing <unk>

4074-0000057-0001509 so did you just hear that message yeah but um no no no i don't have a british accent or anything right i actually have to call someone who has an american accent who is living outside the united states oh all right good of the things <unk> <unk> what they want they want american accent <unk> uh for their database i also could have uh gone if i was a native spanish speaker or native camel speak or or or they have this whole list of languages but both people on the line have to have the same native alright unfair so uh yeah it's kind of an odd thing but in any case so so so so do you have to say anything in particular or death or did they <unk> i i just had to get your permission or and after that uh basically what they want is whatever we happened to be saying so that they can get random bit you know the idea is to get random bits of speech for this and for some reason they want some of it are they actually have three different programs and uh one of them involves a you have to call within the united states in one of them you have to call outside the united states <unk> and <unk> with this this is an extremely good line um because then you get a satellite line which would be very very uh uh choppy et cetera so i i wonder if they're trying to do speech recognition over <unk> reminds <unk> through the thing that that's part of what they're trying to do yeah because then it is they want to work on speech recognition and apparently i'm also on digitizing speech well you'll have to have them or get you to call me back during midday sometime when they're using satellites are sending a threat to japan but anyway well ah this just happens to be the first time that uh because what'd you do here is you dial an eight hundred number and <unk> uh yesterday during the day i tried to do that when it was a time that you might be home and and uh i was actually up in a way right right and it didn't work and then uh i just happened to still be up at this point and i said well see if i can get through on the eight hundred number now and i did well <unk> so anyway how are you doing these days things are going very well i think i had mentioned before that um that uh that uh that there's a company now that i'm working with um which is very much just just myself and <unk> i'm not i'm not <unk> <unk> oh okay okay so you're on hold me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were entertaining offers and uh well well it seemed to make sense <unk> they had plans to to just kind of set up my own company of sorts so um put things are going extremely well so i had one client who said that he minimum amount you know he he uh there'd be a minimum amount of work i have about a a day a week for the next two three years <unk> what'd you say <unk> my bills and so i decided that it would make sense to do this and um and um i've been getting substantially more work than that so i'm quite pleased quite pleased well that's good <unk> oh i'm so i have a bunch of uh work they need to do on my lot this year i've been telling you that i needed to do that roof atrium for quite some time but <unk> come out this year oh well that's good to be an interview and ah yeah i remember you talking a little bit about it at one point yeah yeah so you have no intentions of coming over this way any time soon um i don't see the finances occurring now while i'm actually right at the moment finances are not going real well but i was working on that one uh <unk> uh i the the main reason for that is i had not really anticipated <unk> few expenses that recently came up uh related to a couple of burglaries that i had oh hersh yeah yeah but and not a whole lot i can do about that now indeed do you have to deal with the situation and so that's what i'm doing but anyway uh one of the main reasons that i've been such a pathetic are correspondent has been work i've actually been doing a lot of it oh wow i turned in my masters thesis back in may and i'm actually presently working on um several uh articles okay <unk> <unk> yeah actually it turns out that one thing one little bit and what i was doing uh is going to turn out to be very important and the end and uh from what i had been reading in the literature see the one very annoying thing about all this was my advisors been in france for a year and a half yeah and this made writing my thesis very annoying because there wasn't much discussion yeah yeah i um [noise] anyway i had been kind of telling him that you know from my reading of literature i thought that this one little alteration i had made in my model was kind of clever and unique <unk> and it made one type of solution occur which was seen experimentally but none of the other models had i had yeah they basically <unk> i'm looking at a multi mode lasers and one of the things that they find experimentally are what they call anti phased uh states where if you look at the total intensity uh-huh delays or you get an oscillation which is characterized buy one frequency yes okay if you look if you separate out the different modes of the laser and <unk> one of those you get more than one frequency okay <unk> what's happening is that the modes are oscillating out of phase so that they completely mask each other's exactly oscillations on these other frequencies and uh you can with uh pretty simple model you can find that frequency in a transient but you can't find that frequency <unk> driven a frequent see you can't find so that it will sustain okay yeah so yeah that that particular frequency according to most models damps out very quickly and so you shouldn't actually really be able to ever see it <unk> the only thing is that when you do the experiment you see it got it got it i think so um i found a simple modification of the original formula which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty and in most cases i insoluble but it gives the driving term [laughter] if it actually creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer you just can't always write that down very easily exactly oh wow so the the the <unk> you're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical laser neither uh whenever the same <unk> which is kind of interesting considering that that's not really my thing [laughter] indeed <unk> big and experimentalist not a theorist but um you know wow oh investments but <unk> are you going to get an article in nature <unk> i'm actually i'm not sure if we're shooting for <unk> i think optics letters is probably the one that we're shooting for or else perhaps though i don't think it's quite that significant would be phys rev letters <unk> but uh we want to write a letter and then a couple articles yeah <unk> <unk> and i i don't know how much you know about scientific literature but letters are much more prestigious than articles <unk> oh okay oh i didn't really <unk> <unk> yeah so that that's why it's actually a big deal as i you know writing a couple of articles based on your masters thesis is not at all unusual and physics and uh it's the fact that i would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all and what's actually kind of interesting as i kept telling neil that i thought that this was kind of significant and neil kept writing back that i should tone this part of the thesis down that people have been seeing the you know people see the anti phased motion and it's true they do in the transients and i was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature isn't has this frequency and the transients yeah and not driven and uh what happened was after i had turned in my ceases but before i saw neil again he went to a conference in rochester and their this was a big issue among the people who are doing this work was that their models couldn't show this as a driven frequency yet their experiments showed driven frequent [laughter] [laughter] oh cool and so neil then then like <unk> week later came to bryn mawr and he said hey law we gotta write this up exactly it was like well i've been telling you that the whole indeed so cool that's cool that's mostly the sort of stuff that i'm spending a lot of time on a a well it'll look good on your t._v. your resume so you might as well spend the time yes well uh no it's definitely worth doing 'em and i would have been spending more time on it if it weren't for ah dealing with the burglary issues you know yeah i've been dealing with so are you still living in that house in the middle of the park yes yeah okay yeah i know the thing is that <unk> this place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to it's not a question of whether or not uh yeah that that was easy it was just that no one really knew was worth breaking into exactly exactly and so the problem is that now they've found out that it's worth breaking into yeah and unfortunately like well <unk> it's kind of odd they've stolen very weird things for the most part <unk> <unk> as far as i the first time they broke in the what they stole was just bizarre mostly worthless stuff and ah the most worthwhile thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the preamplifier off my stereo unfortunately because it's a nice preamplifier it has an off board power supply which they didn't steal which makes the thing that they stoled absolutely worthless huh so these are these are so when they <unk> they steal the uh the uh what am i actually know all they stole the second time was my bike huh which was actually where the major problem came exactly isn't it yeah i suddenly had no transportation and so i then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike and then that cost me a lot of time yeah yeah <unk> spending a lot of time hunting for bikes and you know and getting one purchased and then having to go get it and things like that but that's dealt with at least and so uh that's at least dealt with now i just have to work on the financial aspects of all of this but yeah yeah at least <unk> during the summer i can actually uh according to the stipulations of my grant or my fellowship i can actually earn money during the summer so [laughter] okay [laughter] that's that's an advantage is that i'm allowed to earn money now at least oh odd um whether <unk> whether they want you to earn money while you're um but i suppose that they they just wanted that you didn't you know your time to the education and yeah yeah the idea behind that is that the fellowship is paying for my uh schoolwork and for my um stipend and therefore you know i should be living off of that and spending my time doing my work they'd rather then are you working <unk> something to gain money so like yeah that's part of the agreement is that i'm not supposed to work then yeah but i'm actually something that i found out this year that i wish i'd known last year that was interesting and i guess i haven't really told you about this one is that um it turns out that the educational grant part of my fellowship mhm that is supposed to go toward tuition yeah that'd be used on other things if i don't need it all for tuition and since i've taken all of the courses that they offer bryn mawr and physics i uh have been registered under continuing education which costs three hundred and fifty dollars a term as opposed to the several thousand four oh okay yeah <unk> so i had all this extra money to expand and so actually i guess yeah i hadn't uh i didn't have my computer last time that i would've uh talk to and ah so do you do you have an internet address 'cause 'cause we've got an internet link up here oh you finally do cool yeah well it wasn't it wasn't anything i did but um i have two of them all right well let's hear them uh the best one to use would be l. carson okay <unk> at yup c. c. dot p. c. c. c. okay <unk> okay dot bryn mawr b. r. y. and m. a. w. r.

one of the things they just never tell you right [noise] [noise] no they never said anything and i figured there was something like that because i was i was in the inactive reserves the entire time i

be a dill citizen as if you're born in a foreign country like if i were born in in in holland and then <unk> and then had american parents then i could be a dual citizen but you can if i were to ask to become a citizen and holland i would automatically lose my american citizenship as far as the americans are concerned yeah yeah <unk> dutch could care less the dutch would say fine want to be a dill citizen that's fine but the americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that active asking for it just takes away your american citizenship is kinda stupid yeah so i'm uh american <unk> i'm a i'm an ex patriot and american expatriot american living abroad [laughter] i still have to file a tax return <unk> yeah but my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income is tax free <unk> as long as i don't bring it back to the states <unk> iris for you huh [laughter] oh they want their share of they want their piece of meat but all foreign taxes are deductible and my taxes here are fifty percent of income so the taxes here are so much higher that yeah i would never have to worry about it and then she became the uh with the company then then maybe like a thousand dollars <unk> taxable right yeah some outrageously small amount the problem's gonna be the problem is going to be a be anya's american salary is taxable here <unk> fifty percent so we're going to uh some money to the dutch government on her salary or some amount that has <unk> deducted a certain amount and the amount we pay the american government is deductible but <unk> still owe some taxes <unk> i don't know how it works we're gonna need some we're going to have some sort of accounting do it because i have no clue how that all works they don't have the quicken dutch version <unk> [laughter] i yeah i wouldn't trust it because it's so complicated with this international garbage or or else that i'd turbo tax with the the dutch modules <unk> somehow i just wouldn't trust it i don't yeah full of complicated when you're dealing with the dutch tax form anya had to read it nine and her father didn't understand the damn thing how am i supposed to understand it i'm really looking forward to moving to oregon and dealing with oregon you pay state tax washington you don't <unk> i'm looking forward to that 'cause you'll be you'll be you'll be a student so you i mean you're <unk> what is your

will be eleven thousand yeah but you'll be below <unk> mean you're below the poverty line that that level so i mean any income that <unk> but then i've already made say like fifteen thousand or

it looked really sad when you hadn't nice material right like you but real silk and stuff it was a set <unk> was real uh it was the <unk> <unk> uh-huh has real slow <unk> had really nice place on the front and and a split up the side and um it was it was this really comfortable there was no train wasn't dragging on the ground and i have payless she's were nine bucks [laughter] it's pretty funny yeah the whole thing came out much cheaper than it would have been to to buy one and all that well yeah of course yeah and this way you got exactly what you wanted <unk> yeah that was great and we had a formal pretty formal ceremony even though it was you know liberal but but <unk> <unk> at the church pretty short yeah with my cousin and my and adrian adrian from our for uh-huh and then kevin was the best man and <unk> and did you know the <unk> and everything yeah he's my talk to him before about the ceremony and got what you want it and all that kind of yeah we had we had like a meeting they had he had to have a meeting with him um and the ceremony was like multiple choice they gave you this thing where he had the different parts of it like the wealth um and the <unk> and this and that and you pick like a part a for this and <unk> the for that or we don't like any of the uh put in our own uh-huh so it worked out really well the ceremony was great and then <unk> then we went out in the garden <unk> with jim i'm not being part of the universe i can't remember unit <unk> no it doesn't matter <unk> okay that's good <unk> they'll marry anybody [laughter] a lot of people who come from two different religious religious go there oh yeah yeah okay yeah so it was wonderful and <unk> and then when was the um reception like well we went out into the garden <unk> informal receiving mine and then everybody went up to north park and change clothes and we played softball and uh volleyball and four square and had dancing and music and great food that sounds like a lot of fun it was it sounds like it was great yeah everybody a lotta people <unk> the best wedding they never been to and that's i guess the highest compliment [laughter] [laughter] wow so um where did you guys gonna honeymoon went on honeymoon to this island off the coast to puerto rico oh god <unk> the <unk> the hardest part was getting there i mean you had to take three planes to get there but uh we got this book from my mom about the caribbean and um i'd always wanting to go to the caribbean so we decided okay well go we only went for five days so it's pretty short but um the place was totally laid back it was this old plantation house that um [noise] had this twenty four rooms and and they said in the book like you won't be able to tell the guests from the staff and um it it was really really cool and they have you know it mismatched sheets and stuff but wasn't fancy at all but it was really cheap and they just had the bar open all the time you could go and get whatever you wanted and just write it on your guess ticket and they picked fresh mangoes from the yard for breakfast and stuff it was great wow it sounds ideal ack who's really tiny so the island it's only ten miles long um but it was it was good 'cause it you know everybody speaks english and and yet it's still pretty exotic you know [laughter] we went snorkeling and it sounds great that's one thing i really regret is that norm and i didn't have <unk> honeymoon <unk> go on one anyway we're planning on going one on one one of these days but i don't know what's gonna happen well you know i think it would be really funny if we go right now and tell people were going on our honeymoon [laughter] how big are you um well actually i'm only gained four pound uh-huh but there's a lot for you know for how far i am but i'm i'm definitely pregnant [laughter] to have all the you know i need to give myself the extra support when i get up and uh-huh like you know how when you're you know like when i get up like you know like how wide you put your feet apart when you get up uh-huh i've probably put my feet like five inches further apart and kinda hoist myself <unk> thing uh-huh so it's pretty funny yeah i'm definitely pregnant but i'm not huge by any means but <unk> what are you five and a half months now yeah so it's it's just starting to get into the part where you start to show and uh-huh start to get big and all that but it's weird like you know like i'm like i'm not fatter in anywhere uh-huh my stomach i mean and honestly looks like i swallowed i mean it's really weird like me [laughter] i've never really like being a close to pregnant <unk> before you know like i've seen them at the gym and stuff like that but never had a good friend that lived close by that was pregnant that i could like actually look at her uh-huh but you can see the line of your uterus you can see in your stomach where it is it's like this big circle and it sticks out in a circle and it's filling up with it totally what it feels like it really does it move around yeah yeah he he takes a lot i don't i don't know that it's he but i call him he he takes a lot he's been kicking for about five weeks now huh but um he just started this week he started rolling that i can feel i mean they roll the whole time but now i can feel him rolling and it's totally bizarre do you have a main part i mean like uh you know a joke name that you call it when i heard some really good one [laughter] the only one that i came up with with bumper because he just kicks so much <unk> active baby was good yeah <unk> well also the monster child is the other thing <unk> the [laughter] rosemary's baby [laughter] 'cause he kicks that much it's really you know it's really annoying it's a good way to up no he hasn't woken me up yeah but if i wake up in the middle of the night he is he does kick <unk> so you can feel him kicking in the middle of the night if you wake up one of the girl [noise] well it's probably not a girl because in our family it's <unk> if you go on both sides of our family and you look at all our first cousins and everything and it's like seventy five percent males huh i'd be a girl i was positive it was a girl like the first three months i was absolutely positive it was a girl and then i changed my mind [laughter] boy [laughter] well that'll be a surprise then yeah yeah i don't know are you going to ask them not to tell you if i were not having and all <unk> uh-huh because it's really like we went and looked up all this research there's all this stuff you'll see when you get pregnant and if if you want to know just send me email 'cause i looked up a bunch of stuff but there's all this research like <unk> there's all different kinds of prenatal tests that you can get now it's not just amnio it's like other stuff too uh-huh and then there's also um you know the the uh the ultrasound but in fact like if you look at the <unk> the latest research on ultrasound it's like they really don't know like they assume that it's safe because you know they've had it for twenty years right and nothing ever happened <unk> <unk> well they don't know they've never really done any big studies on it or anything but <unk> but if you're a normal low like there's reasons to have an ultrasound and if you have to have an option and it's a really good diagnostic tool right right but in a normal low risk pregnancy like mine it's not a good diagnostic tool at all like <unk> they find as many um false positives as they do false negative <unk> first <unk> well the only thing they can really check they can check the heart uh-huh and then they can check to see if the baby has the brain and then that would be a good idea you know you can do some measurements to see if the baby have done <unk> weird like down's syndrome like sometimes but that's not really very good like amnio was the only sure way to find out <unk> could give you like some indications that the baby might have down's or something but it's really not a very good diagnostic tool at all for people with low risk pregnancy so i didn't bother getting yeah good unfair everything will be fine and if it's not like you know you're gonna are you going to anyway even if it's not like and we didn't do any of the testing 'cause like i i've met like three people since i got pregnant where the baby had down's right they found out the baby had down's can they aborted that they had <unk> well it's not called abortion it's called termination that's right and i just i just couldn't have done that i just we talked about it a little bit you know what i mean like obviously don't want my baby to have a mental defect or anything like that but but if it does you could not have done that so it wasn't worth doing the prenatal testing because you know if you're not gonna board anyway then there's no no but i mean there are like some there's some conditions that they can test for that are sort of incompatible with life and i figured well i'll just go through the nine months pregnancy and then the baby will die when i was born you know it's <unk> like the <unk> we had this friend is is not supposed <unk> just 'cause it's on the topic but um but the baby died at like eight and <unk> <unk> i know i read so many of the terrorists they just freaked me out and of course they make you have <unk> give birth anyway you know you have a new i mean i mean that's how you have <unk> give birth yeah and <unk> said you know that it's a hassle you know you've got to go through all that pain knowing the baby's not even alive anyway but you know she's pregnant again you know they're fine what happened to that they do they know i think it got either strangled by quarter some kind of that's what they <unk> they always say that <unk> they say that accident it's like <unk> then yeah you know something happen or or maybe it it went into oxygen deficiency or something like something happened to her and she was asleep at the time and so she didn't even know it until the next morning and it was something like that wow that is so scary but obviously you know when you have a baby for the rest of its life in your life you have to worry that it might die you know or somebody will happen to so scary it's awful that's gotta be the worst thing is funny how did you get to meet your nephew <unk> your uh i did the baby <unk> yeah it's huge he's four months and he's like eighteen pounds but it's all these guys have a two year old [laughter] he's the shape of a of a small baby but he's been [laughter] that'd be oh you better hope that that doesn't run in the family how well let's see what he was born he was normal size and he was born like eight and a half pounds okay yeah but um my brother my uncle was like six foot four and my brother's big and on gaelin's side of the family there's big people too so i mean he could be big bully [laughter] pounds that is humor pounds from breast milk alone and four months oh my god and yet he's you know he doesn't look that huge he's not very long run <unk> and he's not <unk> he's chubby but he's he just ways he hefty yeah well they don't you know they just tell you feed on demand i mean if they wanna eat that much you let them eat that much and and he's healthy and all you know like do they seem happy and they're really happy they're really happy it was kinda stressful coming all the way out here with the little one yeah but so when they got back it was kinda kinda exhausting to them um oh the <unk> everybody you know couldn't get their hands up baby jack he was a star the wedding [laughter] well yeah yeah but we want him baby too well you know there's only one [laughter] i know but i think we're going to go back to like plan a and and start trying in october when you're given <unk> really well you know maybe [noise] you never know call you up right before i go into labor [laughter] say now if if my cycles are regular as they as they you know as regular as they have been and i'm like <unk> around the end of the month so oh yeah so it would be it would be our halloween baby yeah wow maybe like mine would get the spirit of yours or something like the year it [laughter] so weird i mean they report every day but they're all different and i know yeah so what about <unk> david said had her baby she did wow yeah jonathan davidson i didn't really she was that much more ahead of me i thought she was just a few months but i guess so you had it may wow wow <unk> october is a good time when with the baby do if you and then you have <unk> then you can tell you in all three <unk> be do this time next year oh yeah and then you'd be pregnant all through the winter so that's good you should start trying earlier well we might start trying <unk> to be pregnant in july if it's going to be hot wherever you're living i just don't want to be too pregnant in april when a e._r. is i want to go to your uh well in that case you have to be in your six months a year a so that would be that that would be actually it's no it's eight weeks they'll let you travel up to eight weeks so eight weeks before your two seven month yeah yeah they let you travel until thirty two weeks <unk> but it's even driving distance it's in new york so even though yeah so no big deal and if you if you have <unk> normal low risk pregnancy your doctor i'll let you drive until the end <unk> thirty seven you could drive yourself to the hospital i mean you can <unk> yeah <unk> <unk> you just have to stop every two hours and get out and stretch your legs yeah so and there's no reason to believe you wouldn't have a normal low risk pregnancy i know i'm healthy and yeah gyms and not as healthy as i am but i mean for the little sperm i don't think you might as well have you know you want to get pregnant now's the time to start changing your lifestyle the head i know well that really worry about that but you really cannot smoke i know you're pregnant and it's gonna take a while to get used to it so and um they do say that you can drink caffeine they doctors have no problem with that although i actually quit drinking caffeine when i found out but um i like two two cups a day or something like that the main thing i want to make sure that i'm off at a relation time it's alcohol and then yeah because <unk> it's right to be getting that it's sad like i would stop smoking pot a couple of months before i don't do that you don't know <unk> oh sorry shana such an idiot but i know [laughter] [laughter] oh well well yeah i'm <unk> one one should yes once i agree i i <unk> i'm so anyhow um so uh yeah and the the other thing that that you should do is like start trying to drink more milk <unk> drink for glasses the milk a day when you're pregnant and it's like totally impossible to do but on the other hand you know so sick for the first three months that are <unk> you didn't want <unk> anything else you know i didn't eat anything really but like jelly beans and cookies for the first three months and it doesn't really matter you know it's no big deal like eating habits are really no big deal for the first three months <unk> basically what happens is it's it's totally true when you said babies like an alien <unk> little parasite he's making his own <unk> yeah <unk> record <unk> stealing from you so what will happen for instance if you don't get enough milk when you're pregnant as the baby i'll take the calcium from your bones and you'll end up with osteoporosis when you're an old person i'll drink milk you know and that's the same thing with like protein and stuff he'll take the protein from your muscles and mhm so the baby like basically what <unk> you know the baby doesn't really suffer them much about the mother the mother will suffer she doesn't like get the right amount of nutrients and stuff but when <unk> during the first three months or so small that they need such tiny tiny amounts <unk> when they start getting bigger then it starts getting to be more important to you know eat well uh-huh so but and also you know if you can you can exercise 'cause i mean if you will you already exercise a lot now so it doesn't matter but they said don't um don't change your habits you know like if you're relatively sedentary before right don't go suddenly run marathons and yeah but if you run marathons before you can continue jog until your fifth or six months of you know you ride your bike all the time you can continue riding your bike and now i ride my bike every day and david and said she <unk> she dug for the first three months and as soon as her fourth month she had to go walking oh really but she still like road biking exercised a lot and she she just gained just the right amount of weight and it was totally just depending on the person whenever you feel like like i was so sick when i first got pregnant that um i couldn't even walk i mean i'd go outside and i'd go for a walk and i go like five steps and i feel like bar thing because i know [laughter] it's like there was so disgusting v. morning sick is like the most disgusting thing in the world i was sick when i was pregnant before i was pregnant before yeah terminated it yeah that well then you'll probably be sick this time too i know yeah you'll probably be real i mean it's horrible i mean i it was it was just like the most horrible experience in my life i cried like on the average if once a week and i would call it like my aunt you know and she me on the phone and should be like laughing 'cause she thought it was so cute you know <unk> it's so funny yeah and then i went and visited them and my twelfth week and i stopped getting sick until sixteen vienna my sixteenth week <unk> actually i still get sick but it's not so bad [noise] but um so and then i went and visited them right and she saw what i was like and then she apologize for laughing [laughter] [laughter] i don't know what <unk> get <unk> will oh it's miserable really housing norm doing about thinking about being a father i don't know we don't really you know he he seems to accept it pretty well but i don't think he really has much clue about what it's gonna be like 'cause like i was talking the other day you know he's working now so um what's he doing he's working <unk> doing interface design stuff that's great yeah it's the same kinda job like i send you the microsoft post right but it's it's um a local job mhm so anyhow he's not really going to have much time when the baby get smart like maybe have a few days off i was talking about how you have to sleep in a separate room you know because he wasn't going to have time off and he's like well why are you going to have to leave the room you didn't really have the concept that you know it would wake <unk> oma yeah but he can just wake up and go back to sleep <unk> yeah yeah some people do like i was talking to him one of my friends here at work and he said that you know after the first week the baby never will come up at night and he just slip through the whole thing and plus will have the baby there's then you'll see when you get pregnant there's all these like [noise] is the baby sleep with you or sleeping and some debt and blah blah blah all kinds of decisions for the rest of it's liberia gotten deciding okay i know are you going to allow it to do this and this is the right kind of friends <unk> should you warn them or should you let them make the mistake so i know wow and give him my experience i started you know all the tricks huck's too <unk> so you know <unk> don't worry does relax and have a good time with it oh yeah i'm not really concerned at all and i'm not you know i'm not making any decisions or anything 'cause it's so hard to know what you're gonna feel like i know like lots of people said they were going to breastfeed and then it turns out they couldn't breastfeed or you're going <unk> <unk> yeah i'm going to try it's hard it's not easy mhm but you know if you have the right kind of support then you can there's this thing called let you lead right i've heard of that i'm going to go to something i'll let you lead meetings and you can get like <unk> <unk> and they're [laughter] this research the whole thing and <unk> then you have to decide whether you want a midwife or a doctor and then you can like labor coaches oh my god you have no idea and then there's like different methods of birth you know you know <unk> it sounds like to me sounds like <unk> like learning how to do a wedding it was all these different new categories that i'd never heard of before <unk> absolutely yeah i'm sure it's the exact same thing except that that was <unk> like just a big party and i have had those before but i've never had a baby what <unk> i have to remember is my training from girl scouts we took this special course in my girl scout and we're i'm like twelve or thirteen that was for babysitting it was like a little certificate got the end but it's <unk> it's the first day to what to do <unk> stranger come through the door and you know all kinds of stuff i held held a seven week old for like the first time in about probably twenty year for the weekend and really yeah it was pretty funny <unk> first time in twenty years since <unk> babysat for our a seven week old uh-huh and that's really that's pretty pretty young yeah so it was pretty funny i was like totally <unk> absolutely cannot hold <unk> <unk> well <unk> i have done <unk> ten days old on mother's day i went over there and i had to see him first day [laughter] and now and then i'm liz i'm bob secretary bob's i'm editor <unk> she brought her baby in the first time and she's four months old <unk> she's the same age as my nephew but like <unk> was that was she <unk> she was pregnant she didn't show for quite a while she didn't go to like six months and then she started showing all of a sudden it just went <unk> yeah that's what happens like with first babies that time like that would <unk> even knew oh well that's surprising because usually second baby show really early she maybe she just wore lose clothing i dunno yeah wow <unk> yeah she had <unk> before now she has got to that's perfect wow that's what i want one of each yeah that's what i'd like to [noise] yeah well this <unk> for the experience of raising both genders yeah yeah i don't care whatever i guess yeah whatever friends to me i mean i <unk> it would also be nice to have two kids of the same gender you know yeah it's been they could do more i don't know but um so what's going on with work <unk> everyone and then so well everybody's gone we lost kathy we lost jen are undergraduate research this we lost the grad student that we of <unk> that we had <unk> as a research assistant why is everybody leaving is too much stress or just because <unk> better jobs than quit [laughter] [laughter] that's literally the truth <unk> wow <unk> better jobs and says <unk> mean and that's it wow that sucks and i'm my things up august fifteen <unk> don't know <unk> know <unk> should have money from cassie then she can you <unk> she has british going to have cat these jobs she's gonna hire someone else as a as a research assistant so that leaves the post duck so that we have which is half time so i'm gonna be half time i'm through november probably and then <unk> write ends uh-huh and and needs to the post doc money to pay your own salary wow so she won't get <unk> because she doesn't have anything else to make up the rest of her so she's got another grant and and so she gets that then she will good to have a post doc okay you know it's all up in the air but we're just gonna try to stay here lobbying for a raise uh-huh 'cause men watch matter companies booming and he doesn't pay people anything yeah yeah jim should get paid more i mean i'm sure he's not making enough he's not making nearly enough <unk> and neither are the rest of the people who work there there all the demand raised that he's going to start looking for another job he's says uh-huh do you guys want to stay in pittsburgh or do you wanna leave well if things work out then you know it would be nice to stay here for next <unk> got this cheap place to live uh-huh yeah um my word for it it's much more expensive here yeah <unk> most places it's much more expensive <unk> we have a huge place that we could downsize even pay less than we're paying now and <unk> perfectly comfortably um or buy a small place yeah yeah you could easily by a place where they can <unk> you know what the the thing is is that if you get a job and then you get pregnant right away well in some places you might be able to go to half time but you know if you get a job you have to work at a place for over a year before you're even allowed six weeks maternity leave so you basically quitting when the baby's born [noise] no i get six months maternity leave you get six months yeah i get six months and for those <unk> will be full pay wow does <unk> will be sixty five percent of pay wow and then i um and then if i want i can go back to work half time wow so um but i might go back to work fulltime i normally i don't know what'll happen it depends on what's going on with his work too well right now he's only on a six month contract so he could be mister mom then and you could go back yeah that's one of the things we're talking about we we don't want to put the baby and daycare until <unk> at least a year old yeah that'd be good yeah so that's another thing to think about it oh i know that that's exactly what i'm thinking about i mean my job

have to be more than ten mhm well i mean obviously you know the expenses go up the more he has to shoot you know what i mean yeah yeah like there's a relationship between the number of roles he shoots the cost of the whole oh yeah no i know well yeah 'cause he used to take it to a place in that kind of contact own right stouffer right well we'll all over the black and white um yes yes and if it's not gonna cost too much i'd like to buy one other roles whichever roll the nicest one i'd like to buy that roll okay okay okay so you have to think about how many different shots there would be like

love number and i mean i did not have any at all i think it's just gonna it's gonna be hard enough and <unk> yeah right and i i don't need them right in because of that environment i don't think you're right on that i think it would be awkward mhm [noise] um so i think that's better actually if you if you know this way he could just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the ceremony so mhm and what i would like to do which you know we've heard about people don't elsewhere for the color ones during the mail <unk> as you know put some of those disposable cameras on some cable you know mhm <unk> oh i'll be sure to get pictures of my friends and stuff mhm yeah that's good that's what do you think of that so that's fine okay yeah i think that's valid mhm okay well i told them i would get back to him how many rolls did you tell him i told him ten two and a quarter <unk> okay it's going to i think it's going to have to be more than that <unk> like twelve to fifteen [noise] okay well anyway what you do have to think about is the number of sort of people poses mhm yeah oh i do mhm because i mean you know <unk> he has to a lot of <unk> enough time in order to accomplish all of that mhm you know it's not as if that i mean i know what it's like uh drexel you know when we have bunches of people getting their pictures taken mhm uh it takes a while to get them appropriately set up you know you have to take several shots of each grouping and all of that can take a considerable amount of time yeah yeah <unk> <unk> i'll think about all that yeah okay yeah i'm also going to have a list of stuff <unk> music i went to teach at a play yeah okay well you know anytime you you can probably let them do that when you come back here yeah <unk> i would think so okay i can call him <unk> ask him uh that i could but i think you could probably let them know pretty close to the time itself okay but anyway will probably doubt about that i um you know the invitations have gone out along the information on traveling philadelphia centre map mhm uh so people can see how to get to the art alliance you oh that's nice town for all the people from out of town uh-huh and that i also sent them information <unk> hotel eternal the barclay <unk> i'm sure it's actually the best deal because they'll give me the best deal <unk> wait hold on let me get a pen to write this down uh-huh okay i mean the barclay which is right across the street <unk> <unk> it's right next door <unk> yeah right directly across the street <unk> okay um is um i think it's ninety nine dollars for a double in eighty nine dollars for a single is that what it is alex yeah it's eighty nine for single and ninety nine for a double <unk> did you check on triples or no uh no i didn't but i can do that easily okay ah i don't know that that's a deal that's not um yeah that's about the regular regular price as a hundred and twenty okay so they're taking twenty dollars off yeah they're taking twenty dollars off okay and the holiday inn is actually the same price the holiday inn and that's when <unk> was <unk> was ninety nine dollars for a double without continental breakfast into a hundred and fourteen dollars with the <unk> because i mean that's for two <unk> at the barclay do you get breakfast know now that <unk> okay the room cost is that okay okay mhm but i mean you'd always <unk> as well as i do that all <unk> <unk> if you want to have a relatively inexpensive meal you walk up to join the square two blocks away <unk> yeah exactly and so um you know that area of town you could actually eat quite expand inexpensively mhm uh because there are a lot of um of asian restaurants that you can walk to within a couple of blocks mhm that so you know it's it's not i mean there's italian restaurants right around that yeah i mean there are lots of places where people could eat relatively inexpensively around the barclay yeah well it's that actually turned out to be the best deal okay oh that could be arranged so i you know central written statement to all of the people from out of town indicating you know what their options are okay <unk> haven't that as well okay okay so all of that it's working out quite nicely [laughter] um as it turns out that i think the <unk> bed and breakfast is cheaper than that okay well i can find out about that i didn't do that yeah you did did you i say give you the name of it the reserve and <unk> you know i didn't do that one yet okay uh but i can do that you know you could you ask about whether they'll do triples there and rooms with the bathroom uh-huh okay cause charlie mother and grandmothers are going to be you know his father not coming now okay so it's the mother and the two grandmothers handle a know isn't <unk> coming

graham oh that's what i thought was the uncle's name okay now <unk> oh okay okay all right so that's very nice <unk> did you send out the invitations have you <unk> god no not yet okay i i've just been <unk> you want to hear the weirdest thing <unk> okay today i came out of the british museum and it's just packed with tourists to whatever and lots of italians and i went out around the corner and made <unk> callhome and as i was standing in the phone booth there was this group of pretty fairly like like mid teen age year kids walking by one of them was just staring at adults <unk> okay the young <unk> <unk> in the house where you said yeah oh my god isn't that bizarre and you talk to her [noise] i i was er then i went out and i couldn't remember where i'd seen her before and then she was up waiting in front of a bus with all these italian kids yeah and she was kept staring at me and then as i got close she kinda like walked around like behind one of her friends or something like she was nervous or something right and i'm thinking this is just too weird and i didn't recognize it as her and then i walk past the bus and then i turn around and i just looked at her and then i just started smiling and she started smiling so i kinda know with her and everything but isn't that crazy yeah well <unk> yeah that's what i thought yeah it is a small world yeah so she was there was some sort of italian group <unk> well it was like a school group <unk> thing <unk> it was all kids you know <unk> fifteen sixteen years <unk> visiting the british museum <unk> yeah okay okay very good very good i also incidentally called um the marriage license bureau in philadelphia uh-huh okay now if you're getting married on saturday night the latest date on which you can apply for the license is preceding monday the preceding monday which would what the the fourth of september is that the priest lifting weights the monday before the monday at the same way <unk> oh okay okay but now the the problem is that i don't know the answer to this how quickly <unk> labor day oh oh god it's labor day so it's gotta be the week before so probably have to do with the friday before that you can apply any day of the week yeah okay well i can i can check all the good to see what happens because of labor day you're absolutely right [noise] well we were thinking was that he would come when does that that wednesday about the twenty sixth <unk> okay well i'll critical important <unk> i'm sorry the ah thirtieth or so okay critical important jeff critical important is your having the blood has completed in the united states in the state of pennsylvania prior to the application for the marriage license you have to have the results of the blood tests before they will allow you even to apply for the marriage like wow how long does that <unk> that's what i have to find out i suspect that takes at least three days <unk> mom knows uh-huh <unk> mary <unk> might be done overnight okay <unk> but he's going to have to be here that week before <unk> labor labor day [noise] so we're looking really into <unk> the twenty ninth <unk> probably yeah okay yeah but what i'll do is i'll call the doctor's office on monday just to be sure that they can do a blood test overnight because that way you could have it done on wednesday get the results on thursday and go marriage license on friday okay hold on hold on a second we have to have a blood test we both are different <unk> in the united states before we even apply for the marriage licence and it's <unk> yeah but that's a a state holiday so that's that so we have to have the blood test about three days before that you're going to have to come in here i'm going to pick you up in new york and bring you back <unk> think are newark you're going to come into new will in any case i mean that that <unk> let me find out for sure yeah see the thing is because he can get a cheaper plane ticket and <unk> on the first [noise] which is what day of the week that's the friday oh i see i don't think that will work hillary know because it's <unk> i mean you're not going to be able to get any broad worked on all over the weekend yeah okay <unk> finding that out huh you're just not going to be able to do that okay i mean otherwise you will <unk> will be pushing vows informally [laughter] okay <unk> and so i'm into they guarantee that when you apply for the marriage licence you'll get it and yeah she <unk> she said if you apply on monday you'll have it by friday okay and you just have to have it the day before okay okay but if you were to apply the preceding friday which is what i would recommend especially because of a holiday then you could probably pick it up on thursday or so so there'd be less of a hassle <unk> okay so something like that i think would work and i said specifically will <unk> charlie uh hillary had the blood work done in england mhm and then just bring the results here because <unk> knew you've wanted him to come on september for yeah and she said no the blood work has to be done in pennsylvania in pennsylvania unless we have a reciprocal agreements with another state in which case we will accept <unk> their results but then you know i'd have to investigate to find out whether they ever reciprocal agreements another state so what difference does it make you know because the only other state they would be reasonable his new york state but i think they could just linda certain kinds of complications yeah these bureaucracy yeah <unk> if we just got assassins office and we'll <unk> last or anything <unk> right and so that's ah that's something to think about as well yeah okay i'll be particularly in terms of of the <unk> the the flight patroli's jews okay okay very good and so it's been so busy at work yeah <unk> has a new president say well he's not around yet he's coming in on um [noise] monday tuesday and wednesday mhm he's full of energy however <unk> ah had

just say that you know he'd like <unk> with me this coming wednesday we're already have at least one or two other meetings already scheduled anyway but this was on another subject and she said he liked me with the with seven o'clock and i said at seven o'clock at night because i i actually have um a a thing to do for freshman orientation at seven o'clock at night and she said ah no seven o'clock in the world [laughter] oh so he's just a full of energy i see that's how are you [laughter] well right but what i mean is that you know <unk> he's also the sort of person who probably without taking due for it is so [laughter] it's like you know you couldn't say i'm sorry but seven o'clock <unk> the <unk> for <unk> yeah [noise] poor dad's kind of get <unk> well do i do that anyway this is a chore for me <unk> has he found a house in this area and ticketing breast one sounds from although he's definitely getting presents house uh rick houses are for sale oh yeah and and <unk> in fact i

in cologne <unk> <unk> has deteriorated rapidly [noise] which i can explain my my boss gotten more or less <unk> oh and you know <unk> from <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> the moment you know just from you know one minute to the next and i got to stuck with being the boss and twenty four hours later they offered this child duesseldorf so it was really a very strange a couple of days there in april yeah [noise] um i don't know why i don't know why does happen <unk> must have done something right at some point yeah he he knew the right people and you been doing <unk> right near the right people kept my nose clean [laughter] so now you can change everything around like you like it [noise] you know the fact that we have no money [noise] yeah [laughter] i forgot i haven't even challenges right civil

celebrate his are a hundred and fifty <unk> music school last week and i gave it a little speech and the city hall and you know the mayor gave a speech which i rode for him and all that kinda stuff wow sounds impressive [laughter] for some <unk> <unk> <unk> actually it was it really was very nice yeah or junior <unk> know it's <unk> it's quite an event and you're lucky that you're there at that time you know right right in a more press and stuff for the school itself <unk> which is good so that's a good thing yeah and that well the one important thing i better ask him before i forget but it doesn't matter <unk> see i i had this one free phone call i said oh why not peter hard [laughter] since you don't know anyone in korea it has to be somebody speaks english also too you see that's that's the problem is i don't know what it is actually i should tell you and it's it's i think it's it's some research for computer for um voice recognition and you know some people could talk normally to a computer and then it could actually begin to maybe trans pose what you wrote <unk> all sorts of things like that into it and drove a voice or into text right if you were talking about so you do you take the <unk> um text there'll be speak and gets turned into english yes and it would get rid of all those uh i hope [laughter] 'cause i saw saw <unk> yeah i don't know i don't know i just seen this on the computer and i said oh i can take advantage of this and i signed up my mother and my grandmother because there are also doing a research and german two <unk> and they were they have to be native german speaker's any side <unk> so i hope we don't qualify we don't qualify and i think that will driving me crazy when they do german with so many different dialects i read every just native german <unk> well <unk> don't know what they're into their for right that's probably why they need so many yeah and that <unk> here is another thing i have you got my postcard right i was in europe but i didn't make it to see right yes sorry but had all these place well you know europe is a big place <unk> right and the weather was so horrible i didn't have that great of a trip you know

well you're lucky let's see that you're not you're coming to new york this coming week as opposed to previously when it was so hot i think the weather has broken that's good 'cause that's even worse i think new york it's horrible [laughter] all that but you guys go out to that <unk> long island or something <unk> well <unk> i'll be stuck in manhattan and see uh-huh yeah well but i'm calling because there is a possibility i may be going back again in august and i wondered if you were around around august wealth [noise] um money now in the saturday yeah <unk> i think when i think i'll be here i think the next weekend i won't be here but just can you hold a large effect here it's <unk> it doesn't matter they hire overtime you tell the computer something interesting okay [laughter] [laughter] that would be funny [noise] theoretically i'll be here <unk> theoretically yeah you mean so easily you carry multiple calendar see you never know but i do have to one in the office and wondering home

[laughter] and so since i didn't go to their wedding i i've [laughter] feeling this big pressure i shouldn't onto the wedding last year was like and they started asking me when i was on vacation already and so i'm sort of it's easier to think about doing it when you're on vacation yeah get this idea <unk> when you're at work and say oh i can't go in for weeks how could i possibly just do that [laughter] yeah i know the feeling once you're in vacation mowed it sort of like well why shouldn't i <unk> i have the vacation just you know the time and money and what is money for right [laughter] so i have the <unk> you sound like you're the bank [laughter] now but i have to make up my mind here by friday because that's when i can hold my ticket <unk> so i saw i could get a ticket you just have to have a discussion with my boss [laughter] so you have to let me know what <unk> what do you think <unk> what this <unk> until <unk> consequences for me oh yes oh they're good consequences if you're willing i mean aside from so i have to be there on the twentieth and berlin okay yeah and i couldn't go for you know just you know three days so i had to go at least a week and there was an advantage it's because and if you'd like to join me i love it i was also invited to a wedding on the twelfth somewhere near duesseldorf between duesseldorf and essen can really be boxing in orlando it's north of rotting 'cause i've seen a map but it's in a small thing oh kept kept <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> big <unk> big <unk> big yes yeah that's almost <unk> uh that's almost <unk> okay whichever i suppose that's close <unk> your immune for twenty minutes or something and so if i do it i'd love to have you joined it's a fancy wedding too <unk> <unk> that's where <unk> [laughter] yeah sure <unk> it's actually i can't believe this this is a a german friend that i he worked here at nasa for like two years and within our our german conversation club hearing a german woman i mean he just went back a little while ago 'cause he's in america but he's marrying <unk> german <unk> german too yeah they're both german sisters <unk> german wedding but [noise] as if he was saying we should come from a and one other person from our group is going 'cause we wouldn't you hadn't gotten around plenty of vacation said he's going to be there so i thought well that's something the twelfth and the other things on the twentieth you know why not and then <unk> i'm going to go down and see my relatives <unk> the twentieth <unk> i mean that could be a <unk> funniest the twentieth just my back to them also the wedding where you <unk> but it's like a real thing there's like a wedding it'll eleven and all <unk> schloss kept <unk> or something at lunchtime and then it's seven o'clock there is um there is is he a dinner dance <unk> <unk> <unk> but i thought you playing piano you must have that problem <unk> over [laughter] isn't that mean like really fancy clothes [noise] uh well yeah yeah <unk> ball dresses and you know tuxedos and things yeah i know i couldn't believe it 'cause i met when i was there on the other <unk> i didn't hadn't read the invitation before i didn't think i was going and so i had met his name is heiko for one day and <unk> we met yeah so he mentioned that he was looking for his tuxedo and i said you're gonna get married in a tuxedo said no no no [laughter] that evening i've never heard <unk> quite a wedding but she wanted <unk> pardon i said if you really don't like those things well but it's it's really great meals [laughter] free food [laughter] aside from we can talk and they should be nice people will be and then i'll know one more person <unk> how old are they oh little bit younger than us oh he's probably a good question i don't know maybe thirty two it's okay as long as a twenty one oh no no no no <unk> no friends sprinted herr doktor heiko hecht and jessika whatever her name is who they actually met in in the united states <unk> university of virginia got his doctorate or maybe it's not virgin with somewhere over there <unk> something i don't know [laughter] yeah so they're not you know they're they're not really young so i said they're friends i presume are in the same age i think it will be a lot of family friends i have a girl i'm sure it's always the waves are always family and and the way he was talking i guess you'd have <unk> sounds like his wife's family as well to do or something so [noise] yeah well <unk> <unk> <unk> it's february <unk> <unk> <unk> it's going to be pretty that that's what i thought you know that's what i thought up upscale [laughter] in that <unk> think about it i'll let you know i'll let you think about that and and you can write me a note or give me a call because i know some people really hate weddings but you're afraid to say no or you have to think about it but it's the twelfth and otherwise what i'd like to try to do is stay with you twelve and thirteen because it's weekend <unk> could see each other and then i'll go monday down to bottom or wherever might those relatives are 'cause i haven't seen my uncle in like three or four years and he's just trying <unk> eighty and i'm <unk> yeah i don't i guess there'll be some are still being bug munstereifel they've actually move they don't live <unk> bonn now they live in um <unk> what you think <unk> yeah yeah just a little bit down but i think there'll be munstereifel and then my cousin she still does live in boston so i'll get to see her and then i'll zip off to berlin <unk> to go to the wedding and see my favorite <unk> all the other [laughter] uh-huh [laughter] yeah because you see when i was there before i i couldn't visit you because i didn't want to spend time visiting these other relatives involved [noise] so you're so diplomatic about all that you know [noise] well i mean if i was visiting new it'd be very hard not to visit them the and the year before i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't a toll on your you know i know you wouldn't tell but the year before i did it but that's <unk> just stopped on the train and i had you know two hours <unk> had our wild lunch on again yeah would [noise] we ah [noise] commiserated yeah that sounds like you have you know its positive end result which is i don't know i mean it's <unk> it's a change that's for sure <unk> change and it is a lot of work obviously yeah but you know i really don't know if it's a lot of work i always have the sooner i'm just so terrible slow has this and you should always be doing these things much faster than <unk> was so what if your slow and i'll look at it the other way yeah but i always keep grows <unk> didn't spend much time that i should be doing other things yeah <unk> guess had this talk about somebody was saying you know confirming you know and i know i'm too self critical so not a good idea because that was complaining to them about my mother and their this theory that you know what people do is a reflection of you come home and had suggest that people react he was a reflection of you and what would i mentioned about my mother bugging me was affected every time i see her or we even talk she has to comment about my clothes or what i'm wearing and and i was talking to this woman because she seemed that's such a good relationship with her mother her mother treated her like a human being and not a kitten yeah she said <unk> reflection you know your mother's being critical you know <unk> you see that because you're critical to yourself too much [laughter] well you're filtering the information from her mother yeah but this is ridiculous i mean she's never let up on that i mean it's crazy [laughter] no i don't i mean and i think no not the last time i left him on the phone i bugged her about something else that i been trying to not take anymore but then she cries but that doesn't work with me and she's been with him being mean and i nor the fact that she's crying pretty tough yeah you know [laughter] [noise] i have a speed crying i have a colleague an american girl dancer <unk> school and cologne who somehow or other has fallen in love with me mhm and now that i'm leaving going back to this was <unk> going crazy i'm thinks she's <unk> concluded that i'm abandoning or oh but he talked here pardon in america we would say are you being stalked yeah <unk> reaction to stand in just yeah she's <unk> she's nice you know which is confusing the fact that i think that she's nice the fact that you know she's found her made for the for the you know for the duration order i don't know what i mean it's just [noise] it's very it's very uncomfortable <unk> for me and i'm <unk> <unk> we're going to have lunch tomorrow i'm afraid it's going to get dramatic mhm i mean it's not that far apart even still be friends here you know she doesn't want to be friends oh that's a problem [laughter] i don't want to be friends i can be friends with anybody was well i know but i mean even even make an effort it's harder to see each other <unk> gets <unk> to this thing she didn't you know she's not content with being friends she wants to <unk> she wants to get married mhm oh wow yeah let her on oh are you <unk> said it'd be nice to her you know she goes confused with uh yeah so so the fact that you're moving on this other job just brings it to the head <unk> meet right exactly she's being abandoned that would <unk> even before then you would have let her know that you know she's nice and everything but <unk> you just wanna see friends even when you were working in the same place her yeah well i mean we've never been anything by friends mhm well i think you'll survive <unk> that's for sure but <unk> she was saying you know the <unk> the workers you with the <unk> the room it's um [noise] oh then graders oh two years yeah so that's what i'm thinking well known what's what's coming up what's in store from you tomorrow so i mean it's not that <unk> tough but but <unk> i know but i mean you have to strategy you don't have to really deal with <unk> yeah that's true i guess you look at them saying you're actually the other person's reaction situation they're not something you are doing right that's how she might choose to react <unk> it's her yes her problem [laughter] i know but you know doing a helper with your problem right because your friends <unk> completely mean no but lunchtime that's dangerous time to meet that is that because you're hoping that that well that's what i can only <unk> i can only stand up and say i'm sorry i have to go back to work now yeah okay that's cruel well you'll survive you know the more stories to tell <unk> storm [noise] [laughter] yes oh that's true it will be exciting you tell me that'd be perfect dinner conversation at the wedding [laughter] how i chose who'd martha [laughter] someone who i didn't even know <unk> and <unk> [laughter] [noise] well it's not as bad as my story let's see i was on this trip i was i'm meeting friends of mine who were on their honeymoon <unk> this one friend had a friend in florida so it was a good opportunity and i hadn't well first of all i hadn't seen the friend in a while and i'd never seen florence <unk> for the wedding got cancelled would've seen her the wedding <unk> never met the guy so they called the wedding off a couple of weeks before but the trip was still on [laughter] as a trip you know <unk> why does the cancer the wedding uh he got very cold feet <unk> <unk> i mean they still live together and everything and i think but now i think they're they're talking about some of trying it again well not that no no no of just what it is it gives him cold feet <unk> therapy because it's not <unk> yes it's not it's not her it's just not sure it's the idea <unk> married at all it's the idea of commitment yeah yeah so and so they're going through that but they were still going to do the the trip and she said 'cause we how we paid for it we're both too cheap to give that up [noise] oh yeah right right <unk> the <unk> economic problem yeah and so because it was a bike trip in italy plus a couple of days in florence and so then the week before right before i'm leaving for my for it but i mean there's she calls me and tells me your email me i guess and says i'm she doesn't know if she can make it because her fiance his father just got diagnosed with um cancer <unk> which kind cancer in something liver remember well that's what you know and so then they had to find out about that but she would let you know and and so they had to cancel the trip that was a reason that you can get your money back but she was hoping to come for a few days just i'm frequent flyer yeah and then you know when i check my email on the trip no it's definitely she can't make it it's just too crazy [laughter] and so then i end up going to florence <unk> loan alone and but i in the way i looked up the person who's a friend of hers who i don't know [laughter] so but that the end with mine but at the beginning was here <unk> that's a good wedding story [noise] going back to work and i just keep telling my friend she needs to take a vacation it doesn't matter with whom and where yeah because it was so funny she's such a workaholic when the wedding was off first of all she didn't even take off the day of the wedding i think you should just take that time oh god [laughter] you know and then <unk> then <unk> crazy and she said about the trip you know she said well it's so hard i take that time for my trip and she said when it was a honeymoon you know what could they say at work and i said doesn't matter but she didn't take it and then these are europeans no no no these these oh this is someone who lives in boston that's what it was so exciting to meet them because to meeting europe is kind of exotic right mhm now these are not these are crazy americans as my investment <unk> workaholic america or they're just ordinary manner or [laughter] i have to go there they're allowed to be so crazy i mean any europeans and european with things like that has a [noise] a joke <unk> rear species when somebody you don't find them very often i have lots of workaholic german friends ever couples visiting with me right now <unk> sunday but they're not they're because they're still at work [laughter] [noise] oh no but they're here for business uh-huh here for <unk> okay yes and then sunday they had the home playing with me because they have to do a preparation for this talk on tuesday and it was crazy and i haven't and another friend of mine in berlin definite workaholic so it's it's not but it's it's completely sells um induced as opposed to hear that i think there's a lot more you know company pressure yeah yeah i suppose in germany has its personality quirks personality and america it's evil [laughter] we're capitalists evil capitalist yes i know i was just <unk> well that was some study i was hearing on the radio the other day again about <unk> telling us how much time we've lost how many more hours we work than people did you know thirty years ago was <unk> probably maybe it's i don't know maybe it's true i think it's really true this the story was just saying about couples nowadays buying more services why they didn't let <unk> higher standards of living we wish we have to look forward to finance somehow or other which means we have to work harder to uh but we don't have to work i mean to finance the higher send moving <unk> work harder just because they wanna do everything with the smaller you know margin yeah [laughter] that's true too you know war with less people right for them they work more and more hours but i've i've recovered from that i've since that last year i've that's why you can take this vacation again because i'm still in my motives you know what is my life it's not my work [laughter] yeah <unk> have the vacation so i should be able to take it in august so i don't know yet

4247-0000000-0001298 you didn't hang up [laughter] hang up now don't do it don't [laughter] um okay well we have to make a thirty minute phone call believe it or not um how <unk> how are things there and uh how did the film festival go we're still going on not that way but just to me it's like are you going to analyze my grandma <unk> here's what it is it's a project of the university of pennsylvania linguistics project and they're getting sample of people in in the number of different languages and um basically they take a five minute segment and they analyze it for grammatical structure is a linguistic this that and the other end of course we don't give away any national secrets i don't think there's any reason to worry about it [laughter] yeah i mean that's my understanding that's it's just a matter of uh it's like kind of a great way to have a free phone call [laughter] neither do been sitting around waiting for you know to get a free phone call but i just thought it would be fun [laughter] and like i didn't make <unk> gone to american i don't work out better [laughter] uh-huh uh-huh well actually to my knowledge of they're only going they only do this from the u._s. to um you know to your um i mean from from the u. s. an outward as far as i know they don't do it the other direction but we can find out and if if it turns out that it does and we could have them contacts you had <unk> started getting but that's okay [laughter] i mean you know <unk> i think that <unk> that somebody else ask that and i i think that ah first of all they want a native speaker <unk> m._c._i. can call my brother in new york as one of my two <unk> two hours <unk> opportunities to make a three a thirty minute phone call one is overseas and the others to my brother and that's it [laughter] and in your case unless you had another native speaker there was long distance from you that was over there this this might be the only opportunity you know what i'm saying right right so sorry about that [laughter] is it really eleven p._m. over there yeah it's mine <unk> no you're right i understand well i'm great what can we talk about [laughter] tell me what's going on in america i haven't seen the news and easiest really you didn't get married and i know what's going on around <unk> yeah well let's see what's going on a human and just give you some headlines yeah <unk> yeah i was just gonna say clinton just came out yesterday with his uh his statement concerning affirmative action uh-huh and and basically he has in the past said that he was not in favor of uh you know of making 'em all allowances strictly based on race but at the same time uh the analysis and the news shall we say the conservative analysis and the news is that clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe in quota systems and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that affirmative action is necessary to move uh you know black americans forward into give them the opportunities that they've been denied so he's trying to kind of walking a tight rope you know what i'm saying right in other words sinus these everybody yeah let's see what we can make everybody [laughter] i think that he's making nobody happened i think you're right [laughter] 'cause you know affirmative action's really under attack in the united states from many different quarters right <unk> and it's a big it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender i mean not a gender hey race color blind we're supposed to race color blind and yet it's like contractors that are bidding you know with the high bid or higher than the lowest bid are still getting the contracts only because they are of ethnic protected you know black or whatever and it's really you know and then <unk> they're taking lawsuits to the supreme court and all of this so it's another thing that just came up with that the supreme court said that the uh redistricting of the congressional districts one of which is in georgia violated the constitution because it was based primarily on race there was you know what you did did they were doing it because they were trying to make it more like they were trying to make it they were trying to make the district majority black americans so therefore they drew it ah all the way across the state you see what i'm saying i have a very narrow district edit created a majority black district which then elected <unk> black representative and then it was challenged because <unk> said well the only reason that's been done this way it's just to ensure that it was majority black and that's not you know hello i'm okay <unk> <unk> yeah i mean if it was just thinking today we had a discussion about doing a pre departure orientation we weren't we had a hot topic neighbor we bringing <unk> and we talk about like political correctness and raise them around <unk> might encounter in america when when <unk> when i am not really <unk> american <unk> well there's a lot of frustration i think over the fact that there are there are a number of evidences that the affirmative action program is in fact discriminating the other direction and people are saying wait a minute why don't we just give everybody a of a try to give everybody an equal shot and if someone feels that they've been discriminated against because of their race go at it from the standpoint of tried to remedy it through the courts rather than saying that government has to give x number of contracts to minority no matter what right and as a result some um some people are getting contracts just because of the color of their skin and you know what i'm saying it's it's when they might not even be the moment <unk> either them they're they're not even they're not the low bid you know normally on contracts you take the low bid that meets the quality <unk> specification right and but now you there <unk> several cases where clearly you know it was they didn't get it because i just did worth or right color skin so now that is that really remedying the situation or is it it's creating a lot of a of a resentment and that's kinda too bad how <unk> oh it's a mess really how long have you been there by the way <unk> can be three years in november wow so you really <unk> [laughter] i don't think i'm not really [laughter] well yeah i know when <unk> touch even when i was in america [laughter] oh okay you're that type i gotcha [laughter] my around anyways [laughter] well i notice like because i've <unk> having lived over in korea for almost three years um it's you know when you come back all of a sudden the you know the society's changed a little bit you know <unk> knew terminology new buzzwords and all then of course when you get to be over forty like me um you could miss that stuff just being an american anyway [laughter] it'll pass i didn't know when you get older your mind farm when i was in college i didn't know what was going on i was busy yeah i'm thinking of ah you know like a lingo that the young people come up with you know younger people yeah i think i'm more informed now that i was in college i was sort of out of it in college but uh by the way i did i tell you that i have a new job in your email you said that you don't you knew that you didn't say what your new job was oh okay i'm i'm resigned here last week effective august tenth and i'll be taking the job of the director of english language i'm the english language program of a private university i'm in atlanta a larger university uh-huh so it's kind of a step up for me it's gets called mercer university you'll have <unk> hey now we're talking to you or not people into e._s._l. program where we get requests about it i don't know how many people actually go around and not have a lot of money but we get every year that i have money where you really don't know whether or not they know yeah well you can be sure that we will send you information because uh you know i've got to go down there and we're trying to <unk> to improve the program we're adding they're adding thousands of dollars of a state of the art language you know equipment or lab equipment and all that and they're restructuring everything so that's what i'm supposed to do next and then it's gone i i'm i've never heard of a scholarship for an english language program personally but i didn't either but i keep thinking i'm going to find one one of these days [laughter] yeah i know i'm sure that they <unk> you know <unk> the question of whether they have scholarships for international students um for the regular program is a good one and i'd like to find out i'd like to think that they do and and i think they might but i don't know yet it's not going to be my particular area of expertise you know it's it's that that can be regular program but still i would like to know so i tell people like how are you looking for <unk> yeah well i was looking for new job and i've been looking for about a year and a half and uh when i went to nasa in new orleans you know the one that you missed degree when my son oh it was a blast but i'm not sure it was more fun than miami <unk> you know but it was fun though you would have enjoyed it and as i said you're in the email the uh the russians and the siberians and all of these people were just hilarious i mean we had a we had a nice little visit we really did i'm too bad i can't believe they were calling i'm ronnie we rain here that he was calling her money [laughter] oh really you didn't know that you wouldn't be thinking freezing anything going on in america is well that's <unk> that's what you said i mean i would like to do that and i think it's just <unk> yeah you should have seen them dancing around with the crowd

kinda fun um you know you got to sort of do that kind of weird stuff um i interviewed for this job at the at nap stuff so that's kinda how it got to where it was a you know that was a major major

per cent raise every year oh yeah well if i get three percent around here i was happy [laughter] about how i am [laughter] you got that right [laughter] yeah really you know last year i got two

well anyway but and then <unk> and the black boyfriend [laughter] i don't know when he's not [laughter] oh my goodness you've got some dialect mixing up there i know he's <unk> he's an interesting where we might not be [laughter] yes native english speakers [laughter] oh well [laughter] well you are doing primarily advising right yeah i mean you you talked to students about educational

freedom to think of any program for new ideas or activities and <unk> and i don't really like <unk> <unk> you're right well i'll have some freedom but i'm also going to have a lot more responsibility at the at the new job so it's gonna be different i'll have teachers that i'm supervising and all that so the first thing is to get the teachers on my side you know [laughter] yeah well yeah [laughter] 'cause if they don't get <unk> and again you know i've got too warm you know when them over and then uh try to try to work with a with this this could be very difficult but i'm i'm committed committed

i'll we'll still you know it's also the interaction with students i just won't have <unk> quite in the same capacity you know there'll be bowing down to me now instead of asking me to do favors for no

another place and tutoring you know to bring an extra income so uh it's just a matter of trying to keep it flows and move ahead <unk> let me let me mentioned one other thing you ask about the headlines <unk> you are you familiar with the ah the o._j. simpson trial when i'm not going <unk> i mean i'm telling you <unk> are you going on for years i know you're pretty well travelled and a half didn't do well the only thing that the latest <unk> is the prosecution rested their case and now the defenses bringing people up you know yeah and uh they're <unk> basically the the main defense that they have is that they they're trying to get people to believe that the police planted all the evidence to frame o._j. simpson one that had been <unk> whenever <unk> whenever <unk> for a little bit just to please be doing better than <unk> i know it it's unbelievable it's terribly incriminating the d._n._a. evidence the blood evidence on the wheel the blood on the sox the the bloody glove all that good it looks like for all the world that there is no other possibility they're really does but see this is another race thing because if they've done poles that show that seventy something percent like about seventy seventy eight percent of whites believe that o._j. guilty but only sixty eight sixty eight percent of blacks believe he has <unk> wow that and it's it's a matter of distrust of the judicial system i think on the part of a african americans and i think they have you know reasons for that some of those reasons are <unk> some of them may not be valid it's not this trial is not a racist but people just believe that if there's one juror that for some reason doesn't believe he's getting a fair shake he's got to walk out and he could be in fact guilty you know what i'm saying right so people are very disillusioned right now with the criminal justice system here and believe me whenever <unk> making like a big cat and the time <unk> all the time and <unk> and even now i think you're probably right and it's too bad it's just you know what are we going to do got to have justice in this country and and and <unk> <unk> it's and it's like not on t._v. i really think that's ridiculous c._n._n. selling anything c._n._n. one at least the about that oh are you kidding [laughter] they're going to be with me [laughter] [noise] oh well oh well let me mentioned one other thing we don't have that much longer believe it or not [noise] um yeah the thirty minutes goes fast when you're talking between writing <unk> email <unk> long time i talk to my parents and i i mean half an hour like nothing to me [laughter] yeah but i'm not and when you're overseas calling for half an hour it's like a short well that's true but it is late there and i didn't want to keep you up too late and then after all it's not like on your parents you know maybe your parents [laughter] i may be old enough to be your <unk> but i'm not your <unk> [laughter] i don't think you're right on how well i don't know you just look a lot younger than you are about that [laughter] you'll you'll you'll appreciate that later [laughter] yeah the other trial that started last week is the one in south carolina you heard about that susan smith trial the mother that runs the car to the lake with her two little boys strapped in their safety seats now i didn't hear that oh it's just it's heartbreaking happened it happened last october and i think yeah she enjoys it was like this woman reported that her children had been her two little boys and there's like fourteen months and then nine months or something like six months or something like that <unk> had been um they're very very young okay see reported than someone had carjacked her car and taking her two sons away and she made it appeal over two weeks like about ten days or two weeks where she was saying you know please bring my baby's back and all this kind of stuff and <unk> the whole nation was just shocked what they were even more shock when she finally admitted that she had a pushed her car into the lake with him strapped into their car seats and drowned them they found out she did that oh just unbel well the only reason that <unk> you know logical reason we can think is the fact that she was she was in in a divorce with her first husband and a and she was um uh having an affair with another guy that she wanted to marry but he had written her letter of the day that she did this thing i do not want children <unk> isn't that hideous oh it's just horrible just oh i know and the the the trials just started in and uh the guys who does in and and found the car and everything were testify that they saw little hand depressed up against the window when they found the car <unk> ah i know i won't say anymore but it's just it's just awful it's terrible uh and of course people are saying you know ah okay bring out the electric chair it's time but you know and then other people are saying well this woman was obviously a a offer rocker and therefore she's not responsible for you know that's another big arguments when are you responsible when are you not so when are you in c. o. unbelievable so i think they should just make or break <unk> <unk> yeah although they were just saying well you know which is worse of course she's been depressed and suicidal sense and they said well the worst punishment is the maker sit in jail and <unk> for the rest of her life uh thinking about you know what she did and uh then the other people say well put her out of her misery but you know it's just i don't know i mean because she represented to the nation that someone had kidnapped or children you understand so it's it's it's bad and that's really big on the news too so anyway [laughter] so what else <unk> that kind of news here well i know well tell me what's exciting about your life right now [laughter] right 'cause they gotta cut conferencing breed <unk> europe conference great great great <unk> i thought it would be like the city like new york i mean the thing is marshall in them and it didn't mean to me really tiny things around it might not even like any nice ruin you mean <unk> town

worrying i'm thing where it's tetons yeah usually tetons which sounds really <unk> [laughter] to three calls breath nipples she kept saying grand tetons league nipple rings really so you didn't know the translation <unk> excellent they do pay them a little <unk> are they <unk> they said lonely french canadian rappers and <unk> [laughter] women for years it's pretty fun [laughter] three's the certainly founded though yeah [laughter] but um yeah so yeah i've been there like five six times because i drove across the country three times i've been there waiting yes three times i think this is my second time yeah the first time we had been there was like twelve years ago kevin and i went on like a six week camping trip that must've been <unk> you know washington you know from idaho washington we hit all kinds <unk> oh yeah it's <unk> long huh you know we spent <unk> know a couple of days <unk> stone and then you know i'm very little time in grand tetons but we've spent a lotta time with the national forests right around there uh-huh were you know we're really camping really serious and i'm like <unk> went into <unk> and the town and we were like oh let me like a traffic jam and all these stores there didn't know what was coming <unk> oh my god traffic jam kinda <unk> tell <unk> out of you know you guys have a five year old here a couple of days with their benneton [laughter] where are you guys are really turned into yuppies huh [laughter] scary [laughter] but we shouldn't have one <unk> one employed i can tell you how <unk> how does she <unk> um yeah i guess well norm and i are worse because we live in the suburbs so at least that far selfrespect sorry or not i don't know my hopefully he'll finish soon and uh and um you know i mean he was going <unk> yeah <unk> <unk> <unk> just tested descent and so i don't know we'll see what happens i'll talk to him today he has a job so [noise] if not when you guys moving we're not moving for a year okay good move till okay she probably do okay maybe early june because of i don't come when norm does his defense <unk> which i really want to come for that but you know i have i might not be able to for other reasons but if i can't come in and i'm going to stop in january well probably stop and january anyhow <unk> because i'm going to i smell in january with the baby to uh see the yeah <unk> it'll come out to see the relatives so all the baby yeah shuffling <unk> excellent <unk> do you think <unk> i mean eight weeks it's not really well it'll be older than eight weeks it'll be like ten weeks by then that's not too early to travel isn't now i thought it would be like much easier to travel if we want when he was ten weeks young you know after that new infants it's like <unk> <unk> you can nurse them and like you can do anything you could probably like the sky diving or something but yeah i know we're nursing the baby while you were skydiving maybe it'd be like okay yeah that's what i thought they were doing this <unk> and they don't need that many clothes when they're that young and they don't need toys so you know basically you don't need to bring anything but <unk> but you know your to boot [laughter] since i can't really go anywhere without those anyhow [laughter] hard for me yeah so i mean you know and then we can just use disposables <unk> don't <unk> don't we did one time we were like we were travelling in the car <unk> like oh we can just bring a little mini diaper pail and all that was after one time i was never again [laughter] i'm all for travelling and did you um [noise] every now did you supplement nursing with bottles that all around and you know like i read too many <unk> book so i thought it was like no formula it does make a difference like i always thought formula smells kind of disgusting when they throw up it smells disgusting and when they make their little doodoos it smells grosser thorough but if they're totally breast milk now you'll find it hard to believe but if they're totally breast milk for like the first couple of months <unk> they don't their number twos don't smell that oh okay they don't know like <unk> anything like hitler flakes and did you pump or not yeah i pump what joy that was <unk> the manual alright <unk> did you get one <unk> little battery one that <unk> yeah i think so too i like i can tell you i can find the exact brand new <unk> like it had like this little like nozzle attachment thing on it said you were supposed to use <unk> and i use the first time for like three seconds i like [laughter] [laughter] really [laughter] don't ever do that again and i forget what it said it was for i think it said it was worth <unk> small breasts or something i don't know <unk> like i i took that thing and i threw it away [laughter] it was like a little part you put on top of the novel thing was just like an extra attachment and i think that <unk> would away okay and then it was fine okay yeah i think they were fine if if you could avoid it you know it was a choice in your life <unk> say well for the first couple of months i'll just be home and i'll just get a lot of rest and i'll take it easy and if i'm not sleeping at night i'll just sleep during the day or sleep with the baby plead not through the whole pumping thing i mean if i had to do it all over that's what i would oh yeah because i was thinking it would be easier 'cause then other people could feed the baby and you wouldn't have to be so tied to it if you want to go out to a movie or something we <unk> we never got norm and i'm like whoa <unk> believe me we have a baby when you're when we want to put it in someone else's house or someone come in your house and go anywhere [laughter] see that's what i was thinking like for my inlaws and stuff when we go home for christmas <unk> it would be so nice to just you know leave the baby with them but you can't leave the baby yeah i mean if you know you might have to try one or two before you find one that works yeah when you know they have like things like <unk> the tension or whatever [laughter] power level [laughter] like extra suck for like <unk> what did you <unk> you know at first people like what am i doing this machine <unk> goes <unk> something to get used to it it was you know you could like read while you're doing okay boring and what does it go into like a little plastic bag thing uh well i had like like you screwed on this whole motor suction part uh-huh on to something that was just like a a jar bottom you know it's like a screw thing for the plastic container okay and you can reuse the plastic container and then what i would do is just uh i wouldn't bring little bags like that you're supposed to put formula and with me to work okay and then i'd pour it from the container into the plastic bag and fill out and then go you know rinse out the <unk> thing in washington and did you throw away the plastic bags when you were done well see then the plastic bag <unk> time to go inside of model thing yeah and then you see through the plastic bag away when you're done after your baby drinks the milk <unk> yeah okay okay <unk> you know we have a um a way you can freeze them so yeah we'd end up there was sort of like a a girl or no go for breast pumping like once he's kinda got everything going it was like it ended up i was pumping too much you know we have a freezer full like you've found a year later [laughter] oh that's super oh this all over [laughter] like all that hard work but it was either you know it was either explode or you know pretty much but i thought like you totally got down to the level so even if you only breast fed one you know once a day that that's how much milk you would have i don't know all i can tell you got a big [laughter] like ones that have been at work i you know when you when he was getting bigger or something like <unk> making two bags that was like you said that you <unk> two bags explode that was it and he just couldn't quite drink that much <unk> that was i was working in the morning and <unk> everybody's definitely would probably yeah yeah that's true well i only have fourteen weeks left so while you're getting <unk> know [laughter] i know with the miscarriage anxiety starting with the delivering [laughter] i know [laughter] oh no i had the miscarriage anxiety up until the you know because you have all those well wishers you know telling you about all those things you know <unk> everybody wants to start selling the only thing i would like corner me to tell me about their hysterectomies like somehow some obey gyn connection <unk> see you and they think it will be going <unk> got to tell you about it but i've heard the cord accident stories which had me like totally and completely freaked out <unk> are you still there oh so i had i talked to my doctor about it and apparently it's very <unk> don't ask me why i've heard so many stories about it but [noise] oh yeah and then there was this friend i had she was eight and a half months pregnant and you know maybe <unk> cord accident as people they just have babies that all works out yeah i know i know so i'm not so freaked out anymore good that was like i was talking to eric on the phone and ah [noise] that's what she told me she's like <unk> to say that it was okay she was like saying well you know what this woman's pregnant again and you know will have her baby again soon so it was like no big deal <unk> oh yeah but having never been pregnant before you know i'm sure erica has like no idea this woman must be on just you know absolute pins and needles she must be having the most miserable pregnancy and the whole world yeah and it's such a public thing like everyone knew she was pregnant <unk> month but i mean there was nothing nice about it and i know through the <unk> nap <unk> fine deserve a baby i know and then you know and then have to go back to work and you know and then the second pregnancy must be just like fraught with anxiety and especially since that happened at eight and a half months you know everybody probably be thing now you better really drink milk this time [laughter] you know your cottage season i know i know yeah well actually did start drinking more milk and it has helped with all my little aches and pains and stuff <unk> yeah <unk> um yeah and so i was afraid of ah i read a little bit about osteoporosis and how babies suck the calcium from <unk> from your home you eat too much [laughter] i know i know well you know what can i say find like <unk> the main reassuring pregnancy book i know i should have those the art medical during well i have started reading sheila kissinger a little bit more and <unk> she doesn't say anything so pleased to be reading thing you don't see anything [laughter] any <unk> yeah and she has <unk> you know she'll kissinger has really good pictures 'cause they're all of a the pictures of and they're all like woman who are overweight to begin with this so you know it's not like those little books that you get from the doctor's office you know where there's this like perfectly thin woman and all she has a big watermelon and her belly now [noise] mhm i pulled mel i wanna be will still use my i._d. cards to commemorate from what are they take somewhere and stand up my head or something that i'm a volunteer year so how'd you good to keep trying <unk> good <unk> new number i'll tell you but i haven't tried it lately so maybe no i haven't tried it lately either i didn't use it very often but the few times i use it it was really helpful i use it all the time just to find things in my own office you know it's like i have all those journal i know yeah <unk> it's like now something by someone <unk> what's yeah they've written in the last couple of years yeah they like <unk> psychology two years ago it is [laughter] in norman i uh used it a bit fritz dissertation too yeah well <unk> up and running again i'll let you know what happened with them <unk> iraq oh we did just what you said uh-huh i said all right when you're right when you were able to get it off on time and everything <unk> avenue <unk> august first but oh he's organizing symposium so elaborate half a page for the symposium well yeah like he's getting isabel owe some other people uh anderson richard anderson well that'll be a good symposium if he's able to get that together matthew <unk> yeah it sounds like pretty much it's gonna happen you like you said <unk> learn about it twice and the largest ignored them and he finally like quarter and she's like i don't have time to be scott's it and she said oh boy did you must really just like <unk> was purely hateful i mean i'd rather be rude the only time i've ever seen her being rude is to cast <unk> remember catherine the big the big one you can like <unk> yeah that's the only time i've ever seen learn like math math irritating or something what's going <unk> me oh no she's very good at uh i don't i don't think you should worry about that at all that's not lauren style at all she's very good at um you know separating out don't you remember there was all that stuff with amy and hey you were worried you were going to get yeah in a rub off on you yeah no and now and then when i went and talked to her about it [laughter] it's tough <unk> but anyhow the point is is that when i went and talk to her about it she was well aware of the situation i mean she just needed confirmation from me but it wasn't any uh you know <unk> wasn't like lawrence going oh my god you mean amy did that and you know she was like well yeah <unk> i kind of thought that that's what was happening so i think that she's you know she's really good at doing that kind of thing i mean she certainly has plenty flaws but i don't think that that's <unk> you know i told you when i was really mad that she said that was all <unk> work but matt had talked about and stuff so that's been able to pull the wool over i at least once [noise] yeah but that's just because you weren't there to talk about it so i think has me infinitely forget <unk> or something i don't know i'm still going to work and i'm not getting paid <unk> [laughter] really it's getting more and more depressing [laughter] [laughter] well they just want to get the stupid paper with matt out you know and get that done and then you know then you know i don't know retire or something you know i've been making pointless to talk to people about where getting schools and what to do <unk> fact about being a volunteer i mean i do have to get the hell out of the house it's become completely [laughter] i can't stay the whole day there's too many people in my house too many things going on now my new house and providence there i could stay there all day 'cause it's a nice big will be up rooms like at my own room for my sewing and things but here i need to get out of the house yeah but it's a perfect opportunity you have a whole year i would look at it as a year of totally like forgetting about pittsburgh and trying to focus on them you know providence and figuring out what you want to do there if i could get some experience <unk> pittsburgh school like i go to providence and like exaggerate what i mean do you feel like oh i've been working in the schools in pittsburgh during blah blah blah blah <unk> so what kind <unk> definitely wanted over here i don't know that's the problem <unk> it'd be like a teacher <unk> <unk> when the company and say i don't want to do a cooperative learning project in my geography class where we're going to talk about this what should we do and um do you want to work through the university or a or the universities in boston or i'm not i don't want to travel to boston often do you how far is it to boston what they go to an hour oh forget it that's too much 'cause even if you work you still want to just work half time don't you yup yeah now that's too much forget it like because by the time you left and then you worked half time by the time you got home <unk> the brown he's doing some coalition of essential cool whatever the hell that means uh-huh like read the book and find out what that is all about yeah yeah you could do something like that i don't know yet <unk> with me with that i was about to lose funding for <unk> for that people fall for her consulting opportunity for video theories and things if i was interested she could give them my knees so what i call her and see if she could <unk> that was the <unk> the <unk> or something and <unk> little bit of consulting too so i mean you know you could talk to and say i know that uh she get some consulting work to really know how <unk> distasteful that and so but i know that she also lost some people in her group can work with and they just to see it more condescending to me than anyone else yeah she's pretty hate going to me i think it's the peculiar early <unk> selected side you know <unk> well i really have <unk> whenever i think of an faith or something i know about that [laughter] no but somebody told me which i shouldn't pass on but what the hell of a big now tell me it's like it's so stupid it's like it's the dumbest thing in the world that that i should feel superior for this reason but she's been trying to get pregnant for like two years and hasn't been able to even though they're not even married yeah she used <unk> <unk> yeah i mean with the guy come [laughter] yeah [noise] so what do you think about how like horrible how much i don't like er i think like [noise] yeah but she's totally failed and [laughter] that's so stupid i know it's pathetic but you know what can i say i mean see x. so self satisfied oh i know she acts like that i know of any kind of thinking the iraqis very appealing i know a heater well and you know that you know that that being infertile is like the absolute worst thing that could happen to any woman <unk> it'd be pretty frustrating yeah it's like worse than frustrating and it's like you know i mean especially for someone like an who's you know basically maintain control their whole life you know and here's this thing that you like absolutely cannot control my mom's best friend's daughter had like because her my mom's best friends took some of the the <unk> one in our little thank god <unk> let's see as a daughter you know it's like eight or ten years younger than us who looks like a perfectly normal person uh-huh but who are <unk> they're totally messed up and he's like never got her period really doesn't even have like <unk> or anything oh my god that like off that'd be that that'd be like even worse than being frugal <unk> well i think that <unk> in some ways i mean that would be depressing but at least you know you wouldn't have to go through all the treatments and the trying and trying to get married or something you have to tell someone like your chances of every confusing children <unk> zero you know no matter what we try and then if you hadn't been ever left you you'd always think like it was because you know the chances of having doing anything about it are the euro and like usually medically way <unk> looks like woman and i've got <unk> thinks he basically a male jean or whatever whatever or exercising or why the level the problems that god that's terrible wow well speaking of which she should be double <unk> glad that you didn't get an ultrasound oh really because um somebody posted something there's a mailing list for people who are delivering in october november and someone posted something they were kinda freaked out because <unk> um it seems like there might be secondary uh problems for ah [noise] in sex organs for daughters of mothers who had altar sounds so your daughter won't be without children yes exactly so your daughter might look perfectly normal but then her children she might have problems conceiving her her children might be weird are your grandchildren might have problems conceiving they did like animal studies and that's what they found some people feel like the more technology the better i mean you have <unk> jumper i do i know you should see this october november last there's all these people you know it's like they've they've already had two ultrasounds but they had them early and pregnancy and it's like but i want another one because what if there's something wrong with my baby little window and they're pretty i mean if it was perfectly harmless them little window and always be that everything's great i
