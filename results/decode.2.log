happened <unk> tell me all the adventures yes oh my god the reason i was so blitzed and everything is i you know i kept saying oh well when i get home from philadelphia to be relaxing else tree and it'll be cooler and all of that and we came home and we got home really late friday thursday night because it got stuck in traffic and stuff and so friday robert's mother was coming up to meet me and she had a car crash oh no you imagine <unk> first outing was down to the scene of the accident with two ambulances and for police cars and a great big traffic jam oh my gosh how is she well she's okay as it turns out she's very very sore but she's miraculously not really hurt you went to go down there with the baby well um i guess what the neighbor called and said you know that his mother in a car crash so robert went down it was right down the <unk> blumlow lame oh you mean it was right there it was right down you know that <unk> right in the foot if you're ill um no it was in she'd already turned in pass the church right near the church what's there to crash into their another car heading one day they smashed head on into each other so um and so robert went flying out the door said my mother's been an accident tour out the door didn't tell me a word whether she had called weather's don't call whether she was dead or alive the next thing is i get another call your husband says to get down here right away with the baby so she's stuck in the cart took them like forty minutes to get her out of the car <unk> and all she can say is there in the car behind her holding her next still and everything and all she keeps saying to me is still where i can see the baby still [laughter] so that was made for reading and i was and then <unk> went on an ambulance with her and you had <unk> and they didn't <unk> get them up from the hospital until like eleven o'clock at night and then he had to go home and stay with her uh-huh and so i my relaxing returned home home alone with the baby baby oh god i mean she's gonna she's alright she's okay she's really really sore i guess her chorus ruined yes totally it was new to them and the other one i thought <unk> yeah and the other people are okay the other guy is fine he was actually walking around and <unk> and when you know um no he's a guy he works for someone i know in town here and he um but you're going to be like legal hassle i don't think so um there was a car parked on the curve and he had swung around out around to pass <unk> car <unk> and obviously i mean he was on her side of the road okay he obviously was going faster than you should have been <unk> i've seen her yeah but um you know i guess that's why they call them accidents i don't know i i stay both had insurance and you know at least <unk> and they both have insurance able to do um but so that was my relaxing i i thought oh god i wish i were back in philadelphia with the heat and then <unk> noise and the trolley car and all the rest of it would be your trolley car at night it's funny until you get used to it you know when we were kind of like it yeah well we're not suppose i suppose we shouldn't talk about people we know but dave and mary was fantastic yeah you can say that that i can say they were the most gracious ah they were i can't imagine how anybody could be more hospitable gracious unwelcome and then they were they acted like it was absolutely nothing to arrive with your new baby is stay there would be using that way you know they just absolutely totally gracious about it so that was wonderful and i didn't realize how relaxing it was until i got home and <unk> to the contrary because she's really going to be all right so it probably is she's very very sore because like all her muscles spasms but she was <unk> she better go back to her um health club uh i know at the moment she's not sort of going anywhere but she had a doctor's appointment on wednesday to go get checked out again they x ray or and everything is not broke and she was wearing two seatbelts you know the lap and the shoulder belt <unk> italy and yeah she's okay it's really amazing that she is but <unk> anyway i'm kind of live kind of what happened i thought oh this is life this is what it is yeah you know this is just the way it is [laughter] yeah so and then the next morning of course mom and dad arrive which uh they've already been down there yeah they came down on saturday oh my god and i'm <unk> already seen the baby yeah they came saturday actually they didn't let me grass for wonder their feet um well it's funny i didn't know if they weren't going to come so fast ads said i said but when you think you might want to come this call them from philly yeah that's <unk> about five hours <unk> which is exactly how long it takes to dry [laughter] and um [laughter] mom said well you know we could go in wait we could go what we could go to your house in wait until we got i thought my innocence that they were going <unk> <unk> well you're coming up to maine so soon anyway i thought they'd just wait it doesn't work that way with the first grandchild maybe with little deck and that would actually they made some funny noises about well we're going to the road he's on wednesday and we can't change that so maybe we'll come down after wednesday and i said you know wrote this coming and i don't want you all the <unk> the same time i want my time with ruth so yeah um they might have waited if i had let them but i don't think <unk> dad wanted to mom lives they get <unk> overwhelmed about having to go to many places are <unk> yeah um so they came and that was nice day seem very very happy well that's neat yeah they've already seen her yes so but it's funny you know i'm a little surprise i shouldn't be i know is that um they actually let me do quite a lot of like serving meals and uh-huh you know yeah you'd think they'd come to really helping they're willing to be helpful to hold the baby yeah um [laughter] but i was surprised at how much you know could i have a glass of juice and let's have breakfast and you know yeah <unk> and what you know it's double the dishes and stuff i was a little surprised but i think it's that their formal robert that that it is it that they're scared to make themselves at home it's like the opposite of david mariette well it's funny 'cause i was feeling like jeez you know yeah and robert said well their formal their parents are formal and that word clarified for me what was going on yeah you know and that he's right they are sort of formal and you don't just go into somebody else's house and we'll be meals down on they're good to have your and they have this whole idea of not taking over mom <unk> little <unk> i would have been happier she'd have taken over the <unk> <unk> if you said to her i wished she just take over to you know that's true that's true 'cause i had moments when i suddenly realized she was dying to scrub my stove and i just said all right oh [laughter] see i've never ever affected that impulse would you visited me i wish i would [laughter] does need scrubbing into big way but i don't think she dares your place frankly i don't know why well your place is very very special it's so much yours it's also very very dirty so maybe the other thing she may feel that if she started she wouldn't know where to stop [laughter] much i'm just guessing but anyway oh well so they didn't <unk> but they stayed in a hotel uh-huh [noise] and and the way that was just as well uh-huh but they really liked me uh-huh very very sweetly they should have some pictures soon building <unk> anything <unk> bit of an adjustment i go in february and i come back and my parents or grandparents it's sort of trying to absorb that yeah it's funny <unk> you'll see in the pictures they look very well suited i'm sure they will that sort of what scares me about it i think they've been actually waiting <unk> pressure on any of us oh i know they have yeah mom has told me oh she's told me they haven't set <unk> around the time you got married <unk> knew she was ready <unk> oh yeah well i know she didn't she had a surprising inventory and her head what was available and gee we'll occurs you know she and i both can't stay out of here ever since joseph was born uh-huh whenever i come up there i took some pictures with you in mind of joseph holding me really <unk> yeah he looks all lit up wait to see the golden boys get silly when you try and take their picture i know they make <unk> and so forth beautifully photogenic until the age of about three and it was all over at that point he started <unk> yeah well i don't catch 'em on a where's i've got nice pictures with him that i'm able to take when he's busy like playing with <unk> right <unk> most people look better you know when they're not self conscious sure but <unk> but he's also at the stage now and paul makes the most extraordinary things and then when you try and take picked [laughter] so i don't know what they'll look like but i'm sure i have a whole is where he's holding up this beautiful mask that he'd mary made oh i saw that picture and he loves <unk> that was the most fun part i brought it down when <unk> or something was the mole yeah from the <unk> <unk> uh-huh and he was ecstatic that he had that picture and he wanted to put it up at nursery school you know each child can have a picture on the bulletin board uh-huh of himself or herself and mary at first tried to talking out of it on the grounds that you couldn't see his face uh-huh really tried to talk about it but she didn't care but he was just so excited and he that'll <unk> <unk> well i have a nice picture of you in a couple of nights pictures of you and <unk> that were taken here before you left really yeah i was gonna i only just recently developed the film and i was thinking of sending them but by now just you'll probably see them sooner if you i just hold on to them <unk> nice ones have you piled up in that red and white striped chair with jack on top oh [laughter] well that should be fun you're very nice i i got um cards from each of you yesterday oh good yeah and i loved that dog finally send you the one with the dog yes what agree on that together last summer in maine actually and i suggested it might be good in maine no not that when this is a pyrenees dog oh oh okay it's a really wonderful looking ruffle doodle uh la brea yes is that what they're called it's on the back yes yeah they're all over here <unk> <unk> yeah they're very common in there as i sit in the car to versions uh-huh with a blending living with a black muzzle is french and without a black muzzle spanish <unk> i like the want to hear any and sheep dogs uh-huh and in fact i know realize the pet dogs that i met him my very first trip to spain that was like something amazing like twenty two years old <unk> was <unk> <unk> basically i mean that was the idea behind that dog well he's a nice looking dog when you see the carts from both of us i also got card from you know what he's send 'em a little card of some people stand the black and white card i'm standing and he's saying no he's not in paris alone in fact that he's going to paris and he'll be alone but then you can't really say he's alone he'll see his mother and grandmother oh maybe i don't know when you could have written it that that's great i maybe on a train or i mean i think if he wrote it on the train yesterday and you have it today it seems strange that seem very impossible maybe it's from a while ago i you know i'm over graces so i can check her i would you know but anyway and i've got a square ugly baby on my lap now he showed me something i think he was sending too which was this ticket from that position we had gone to that's right <unk> we're here to uh-huh that was in there too right and <unk> to me right and i like that you said you only mentioned was something about the what about the baby you know once every forty minutes by keeping very busy oh that we can yes <unk> was great but it was quite there [laughter] so tell me a little bit about the day she was born when did you first see her um what happened was we went to the hospital she was induced mhm so we get a phone call <unk> she was supposed to um the birth mom was supposed to go in at um it's a nice thinking that this'll be distributed publicly right at um six thirty in the morning but she called and they didn't have any beds oh no she called us and told us that but then they did get a bed and she went into date mhm or seven thirty or i guess you went in at seven thirty and they started her at eight or so so we hopped in the car and drove down to be there for the day and um we hung out all day we had a we had some difficult times with the lawyer down there he was supposed to show up and we waited all day and he never bloody showed up i don't know and um he and also she was expecting him too <unk> you know and so that was for him <unk> but anyway we waited all day and um [noise] but then five twenty five mae was born right and the birth mother's mother was with her through the whole thing and she was fantastic she was just great she was so nice to us and so solid there for her daughter and just a wonderful woman person and um she was great she came out you know a couple of times during the day she came out and gave us little progress reports of housing and we're going and actually it was very funny because the first time she came out i mean here we're out there sort of ringing our hands and uh-huh sweating it out and wondering how everybody's going and everything and she came out and could i go downstairs because i'm her daughter wanted playing cards uh-huh so i guess she was bored uh-huh i know [laughter] so we went downstairs get playing cards with her and uh-huh and then later on she came out and she wanted some chewing gum [laughter] um i guess your mouth gets dry and you want some things so you know it was it was kinda funny these reassuring in a way i would think <unk> yeah but he's very um you know there's such sort of specific little yeah and um then but they kind of held her back i think the baby would've born been born sooner but the doctor didn't get there till around three so i thought once it was induced there was like no stopping it no they can hold you back <unk> little bit you know <unk> once <unk> depends how much stuff they give you stuff but anyway i think they were holding her back a little bit because they wanted the doctor there uh-huh um and the doctor showed up around three and mae was born at five twenty five mhm eight pounds eight ounces mhm and screaming <unk> really screaming and i was a little scared i thought oh my god what have we wrote you could hear her out through the door hall you know and there were a lot of babies being born you didn't hear them all uh-huh and <unk> and um what happened i guess um [noise] that's right her mom came running out to tell us the baby was born and then she said that's hurry here [laughter] and um [noise] so that was a beautiful birth i mean two pushes and she was out which is really great so she's very unsquashed and unbattered looking for maybe usually they look a bit bashed yeah but she's got a nice shaped head and you know she doesn't look like she was um you know she's not <unk> but did you get to see you're in a few hours <unk> what happened <unk> right away <unk> there was a very nice um delivery nurse who had spoken to earlier in the day named tina and what they do is they take the baby from the delivery room to the nursery normally they go directly and tina very very sweetly zipped past the door to the out outer part of the nursery where we were waiting and let us holder <unk> she was just minutes old then wow so we held her for just a couple of minutes and uh-huh it was really funny because you can hear her coming up the whole screaming loudly onto handed her tummy screaming loudly and i said to tina and also to the birth mother's mother there you know <unk> robert has the magic touch i handed her to robert instance silence uh-huh instant she just stopped screaming immediately aha so he held her for a little while and then the nurse was afraid to take her <unk> she's going to scream again [laughter] and she did [laughter] off they went to the nursery and then you were almost three days <unk> are you <unk> for robert it was very nice wasn't very wonderful for robert and for me to just to see i knew it would work too yeah i don't know what it is he has some you have <unk> body warmth or something but i think it's partly <unk> but there are certain kinds of men who <unk> i think it's men who have like these big i have this theory that it's men who are very broad right under the elbow you know like broad under the elbow you mean the chest know from the elbow down towards the wrist oh who have like these big broad forearms [laughter] i think that it gives security i threw remember otto who moved my filing cabinet that time <unk> philadelphia he's another one uh-huh he's big he's sort of solid <unk> very solid and they but robert's not <unk> like that nobody but robert his big below the elbows i'll bet if you have to check out below robert's [laughter] at any rate um so that was nice and then we watched through the nursery while they do if you survive the first four hours of life in the nursery you'll survive anything after the most sort of appalling introduction to life <unk> but i was kinda scared at that point because we're looking and and they're all these nice sweet little pale babies lying there live and there's mae and she's big compared to the rest and she was bright red and <unk> is screaming and she screamed and she screamed and she screamed and all the rest of them as soon as they they sort of get exhausted after two screams and labs and she was healthy i guess uh-huh screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and screamed and i thought oh my god what have we wrought here [laughter] you her off the car when it really they tell us anything in fact at the hospital they weren't <unk> they were <unk> the individual people we had contact with were were decent to us and friendly but <unk> the hospital policy was rather unfriendly to us how that <unk> like we had been told we they have a room called the bonding room <unk> the whole purpose of the room to let people being it with a baby who are going to be with the baby right and they wouldn't let us in there so it was really quite awful they wouldn't let us they didn't they they gave us they didn't tell us beans yeah i mean they really didn't talk to us they didn't offer us that parenting class that they offered to most people we would have had come back the next day to the hospital which of course we weren't going to do um you know they really weren't very nice and yeah i guess they have their rules are just very rigid <unk> and the problem is a lawyer was supposed to have arranged for 'em right an additional bracelet <unk> in other words what happens if they put one on the wrist of the baby one on the ankle one on the birth mother and then she has <unk> what you call the fourth bracelet which she can give to whoever will be her coach through the birth and stuff and of course had given it to her mother i switch makes perfect sense mhm well the only way they couldn't get their minds around the notion of a fifth bracelet for right so the only way that they would have let us in there was to take her mothers away right which we wouldn't ask him which i wouldn't do right and um the lawyer had told us he had arranged everything ahead of time and there was supposed to be i._d. there at the hospital for us and it was all set <unk> of course he hadn't done anything that no hadn't done anything he's been just hopeless i mean i think legally he's not hopeless i think he's done all the necessary legal things but <unk> you know in terms of the things he said s._o._b. forgive me tape whoever you are but <unk> was fucker and i'm <unk> i'm sorry but he was he said published actually well they can edit that word anyway it's english so yeah it's american english um [noise] you know he he said things to me like you'll have her for the rest of your life you know yeah don't worry about it which is really an arrogant attitude to take you know and [laughter] yeah he was really he was a real arrogant s._o._b. so how old was he i don't know we never met i mean never showed up he ended up in the end his <unk> he sent his partner to actually sign the papers who's not even an adoption attorney he does litigation doesn't know what he's doing but i hope you did with his partner told them to do but he at least with a sensitive human being <unk> and um you know so that was nice he had some sensitive and we're going to get cut off soon and i wanted i always something than what <unk> you can tell me some okay now i'm <unk> i'm not worry and feeling like oh my gosh should all of this the and the public record <unk> oh yeah well they just beeped i think that might mean we have to have okay we have that i want to tell you i saw four parakeets fly across the street in barcelona oh neat is it already universal is it gonna be thirty minutes in about five minutes i think oh okay 'cause there's a beep coming on my end yeah you don't hear it no okay well ignore it so we'll let them go on so anyway oh so that sounds very nice they were loose or in the well they were loose they were i said i think i hear a parakeet you could tell he thought that was nonsense that it was a heroin and i saw it but the sun was against my eyes <unk> couldn't tell and then it flew and when it flew three more of them flew out of the same tree oh how neat there was this beautiful there was a street i walked down in barcelona big we'll bird sellers yes they were closed up that day but i'm sure that <unk> <unk> well it was a wonderful place i mean i guess you have to sort of just sat there and <unk> it's hard <unk> <unk> it was beautiful i mean it was just so beautiful with all these amazing birds and <unk> and also in parts of spain i don't know if they have this in parts of france but i tell you talk <unk> spain where they have birds on the shutters and they put them out during the day it's very popular in spain but it's not so popular here in france yeah it was very little of it yeah um i had friends in the trade whose father bred birds <unk> oh really are apartment yeah parrot hobby no little tiny birds i don't know what maybe yes song birds of some uh-huh and he was good at breeding them uh-huh so oh well that's <unk> but when you went up to connecticut all was well resent another adventure connecticut did and then you had to go up and get jack and everything <unk> oh yeah it's it's new york still but um yeah we got up we got jack we went to the lawyer our lawyer who's been absolutely fantastic start to finish i think she's great um and then <unk> came home and that's when <unk> then robert's mom crashed the car [laughter] oh i see it was after that she actually we had to do that at like eight o'clock the next morning cause martha was leaving by nine <unk> mom and dad were down there for how long they came saturday and stayed saturday night and sunday and left monday uh-huh this past monday like yesterday mhm yep so great seen baby <unk> good who's a sweetie pie she's here with her head off to the side you know babies look like they have no neck yes it looked like they just go ahead on the body and it's on the side very sweet she's sleeping on my lap through this whole conversation i picked her up midway mhm so i'm impressed i can have a conversation you know my son's you can't i can't tell you the number of people i've known who've had babies and you couldn't really speak to them for six months and then once the child starts to talk it's even harder i know now i have friends who i call and invariably they want their little someone on the phone metal sitting there <unk> little someone told [noise] god knows what for fifteen minutes it's like okay katie can i talk to your mom now and um yeah you know you have to sit through it and i called england the other day to talk to julie and she said <unk> window wants to just one word with you [laughter] okay when <unk> [laughter] yeah it's so funny to have a seven year old said you at the end of the conversation lots of love [laughter] which is what he said we so cute it's cute yeah so you're coming soon soon it's getting sooner all the time i think a week from today i should be there uh-huh so oh well that sounds wonderful i can't wait to see you i can't wait for you see her i'm hoping i'm hoping assuming that <unk> arranged for us to go first night the european dean is okay if not you're welcome going with us you know what it's like <unk> thank you okay you know i would actually like it but um it's either you guys you might yeah relax i just saw the first night <unk> kind of late and stuff yeah well we're often up late these days so yeah your problem <unk> goes to bed between eleven and twelve usually uh-huh and sleeps until i don't know for <unk> uh-huh and then sleeps again until morning so it's amazing i mean there are people who wait for years to get to that will last night she wouldn't go to sleep until one o'clock in the morning but then she slept until five yeah so it's not too bad i signed as as long as you can get three and a half hour stretches you can we haven't been able to from the <unk> that's as much as you ever get here and to lose anyway how come <unk> noise oh really yeah oh well then you'll be right at home though but <unk> doesn't make a lot of noise when we get up i mean it's not like we finally started sleeping with ear plugs yeah that's what are <unk> are not um upstairs next door neighbor's brought ear plugs knowing we were getting a baby but they haven't needed them and you have anyone <unk> house um yeah <unk> yeah there is someone living over there i don't have a lot to do with um the guy named jack okay <unk> certain amount of confusion between [laughter] jack's but um but he's not a problem or no no we really i mean it was real nice having martha there i mean yeah there's no comparison at all and i miss her and um you know i worked jack so much less yeah she's not there and <unk> and <unk> must be funny when you go out in the yard and holler yeah track come here and how <unk> how is he responding he's okay he's <unk> but i can't tell how much is the baby and how much is the heat uh-huh um and he did something yesterday he's never ever done which is a neighbor's cat wandered into the house well it hasn't happened before but he took off after that cat and chase it out the door and around the building and <unk> it's making noises like he was going to eat it which i don't think he'd do and he's never done anything like that towards anyone not showing too much laps jealousy or i i don't know whether that's what it was really <unk> you know misplaced lapt jealousy <unk> he certainly wants attention does he get to be in someone else's lap sometimes when you have the baby or when i don't have the baby i let them in my life [laughter] i don't know how people deal with older children when they have a second one that really must be awful it's very hard it must be awful but if you have the baby and one of 'em you can have the other one around the other kid yeah but it's hard it's not that easy 'cause it takes two hands to feed <unk> okay there's another beep that <unk> that might be a really really looking forward to um giving jackson extra attention good good to it we can help that way okay see you <unk> okay thanks lovie bye bye

said you know he needs to sit in there and he needs to have the chairs so he can push up on his arms yeah you know and well actually yesterday i convinced him to try standing holding onto the chair yeah and taking a shower and he didn't want to do it and i said well i think it's going to be easier on you know so let's see what the problem with just sitting on the chair and taking a shower [noise] it it was it overeating on the chair was was not so much of a problem but the shows a little cramped all and he couldn't get his bottom wash them all like that so i'm standing was easier it was just much easier for him so he was grateful for that well at least you have the the <unk> <unk> yes yeah <unk> <unk> if he needs that you know but <unk> all these things if they had only been done and i know where <unk> on them and we shouldn't but yeah we have that nightmare of the fall so today he said well i'll take an x-ray in two weeks and i looked at him i said to do today i said what's the point of finding another two weeks to find out if there's been a break or something you know so i said well he said i kept you waiting so long today i didn't want you to wait any longer i said we're here will do it so he took the x. ray and everything looks fine how's he doing sleeping terrible that's just leave on his back test asleep on his back for several more weeks yeah <unk> and he's going crazy and that was the one thing he was hoping they say you can sleep on your side now and <unk> <unk> they just this guy said i'm telling you what i would tell my father he said don't do it he said other people will tell you <unk> on your side right now but he said i'm telling you don't do it because you could throw it out and <unk> and you don't know what you're doing when you're sleeping

pressure on that incision you can even open up the session <unk> and he said then you don't know what you're doing one you're sleeping and you can turn your head than or something yeah and then you live <unk> <unk> you know and they're saying he's he's nuts eating at the table because when he sits at the table hands to kind of lean forward yeah to them right <unk> and they said that <unk> know mhm and so he said he can go out for dinner yeah see them <unk> you're not supposed to have better than ninety degree angle you're not supposed to have it more than a ninety degree angle <unk> more than ninety till i always had something you know <unk> right <unk> right and you know people think we're nuts you know people come to visit and i say you can sit here there and there but you can't sit in those two chairs because of the chairs allie sit and yeah and i looked at me like what what difference does it make you know it makes a lot of difference in the chair he's and yeah and then i'll

been so nervous as i was that night while that's enough to scare the life out <unk> home and have him fall right you know and then all i could think of as if he pops something that was my fault yeah you know really wasn't my fault but that's how i felt <unk> you know and then somebody else was saying well you need to laugh more blast while smack you yes yes because you do very well in that area too you know so one one i'm not laughing or allie's not laughing at something you know and then somebody else said well you need to get out more toni and i thought why i want to be with our yes and i have no desire i wouldn't care if i ever went out again you know and <unk> and she said all you need to get out and you know be among people and everything and that's because she needs that she could this person to never stay home five minutes <unk> but i don't need that i can't tell you the last time i've been in the department um daughter he doesn't want to go out oh no [laughter] it was terrified at the doctor's today because little kids were running around and the mother using the walker or the crutches or he was using the walker and then um monday the nurse and the third pissed encouraged him to try the crutches and so today here the crutches going to the doctor's office because it was easier <unk> the doctor's office no matter where you <unk> you have a long walk to the door because they have like a courtyard yeah instead of having handicap parking and and the area that you have to walk on half of it is uh like fake stonework cold boy yeah crazy this is <unk> mm and knots and um and then when we went to pull into the parking place some dude on the handicap parking place he had taken up to places where the ramp was a young kid and i said boy <unk> hope <unk> get some <unk> car when i'm out here because i'm going to give him a pace in my mind but i was parking the car when he got in and took off you know so i didn't get my opportunity <unk> but anyway he is the crutches going and coming i had to walk with me but i never use the <unk> i i never i would be afraid to yeah he <unk> he was quite comfortable with the crutches and and <unk> but he can't use them for any length of time because he gets tired and so let's see what else so the swelling has now pretty wild on down but he said to where the sock for another week during the day he told me to get vitamin e. and break it open and put it on the incision <unk> that helps and the healing <unk> the incision mhm and um you know and <unk> put peroxide on the incision and that and the one question why <unk> asked uh he showed us the x. ray and it looks gorgeous you know but the therapist said you know like three months from now or even six months from now if you take an x. ray you can see that the body is still healing <unk> she said you don't see it with an added on to get to see what the answer and i meant to ask so i used to be an x ray technician but i don't remember where would you see that where would you see the healing and the bone you know i don't know <unk> nobody ever showed <unk> really you know no no and <unk> did they show too before yeah and they didn't show you the after

she said i don't know much about this can both <unk> men [laughter] it's kinda fun you know <unk> well susan definitely wants to be a man yeah yeah so it but then <unk> and got her hair butched that short then god that sounds like she wants to be a man too <unk> jeez i'm like man they says who knows maybe they can both be then i guess so that is just so bizarre yeah really like i said i think the red flags were there all along and we chose to ignore them yeah because we wanted happiness for todd oh yeah oh yeah that was my very first thought that oh don't be so mean don't even say that <unk> yeah yeah i i looked out that window and they were in the back yard and it took me a minute to decide which one was hot yeah like <unk> <unk> yeah well and i'll never forget that night when they were ready for the wedding when she said when she mentioned that girlfriend and how you know she thought <unk> you know this girlfriend works that they would couldn't be friends anymore and she told her that was so and i thought why she told me about a girl friend yeah yeah i remember then <unk> you know i mean yeah all the little bells went off in my head but i just thought no no no no you know [laughter] i know there's a lady in our office who was married and got divorced and her last kid just graduating from high school and she was talking about that she was going to sell her house and get a small place and she wanted to be out in the country and blah blah blah yeah and i'm in senior year or so ago at a restaurant with a lady and you know and they acted guilty when you saw them you know things yeah and it was this saturday night you know <unk> but it was kinda like she was a small restaurant that i am the other people picked it but it was like way out of the way and not a place i've ever been before ever heard of and right and there she was and so she kinda it was it was just a little different than <unk> you know and i thought that's kinda strange and then i thought they they kind of looked like they were you know yeah pretty close and stuff and [noise] so anyway then my secretary told me that they should only rented was into days you know she bought houses which we've talked <unk> spring and she said something she was going to and stuff and she was she bought it with another lady <unk> <unk> oh [laughter] huh and i told her about seen her in the restaurant and how they acted kind of weird and stuff and she said why we've kind of wondered about her she is a real man hater she just oh rolling figured that was because she went through a bad divorce yeah really did he ran around you had another woman in yeah kind of a bad deal for her so ah but anyways you know it just all makes sense yeah like you said the little signals were kinda there but you just think oh that's you know yeah don't jump to conclusions you know he's <unk> he's out with another woman you know that doesn't mean she's a lesbian or anything and i really thought even if they live together i suppose they don't necessarily have to have a sexual relationship you know that i've thought of doing that before and i i still think if something happened <unk> you know later on and they had a woman friend that i enjoyed and stuff i wouldn't you know <unk> yeah <unk> opposed to very allie's together or something to share that i've been having a companion and stuff and it wouldn't mean we were sleeping together and i went um [noise] each to their own yes that is just too bad todd had to be caught and <unk> and i say get messed up with all that <unk> i guess he's still going to church every sunday medicine you stop on his way to church or something and [noise] so i don't know maybe <unk> can find somebody else <unk> you know i think that would be better <unk> oh yeah and and then quit going over to see her parents and stuff i think that's <unk> prolonging the oh it is so is but i think you need that you do it too you know have it right you have to go gradually out <unk> and when when you know when that's not right for him anymore around yeah poor little brother but <unk> one time <unk> so yeah but it's just kind of interesting and then she wrote some stuff about mary blakeman [laughter] oh really i gotta get this it's just right over here okay [laughter] this is for you to take a second <unk> [laughter] that i had everything here in our my call but and i had my my banana and everything i'm out here <unk> at this letter what she said um [noise] i went out to see mary last week they've moved her from the therapy department to regular room and her roomie is a black woman married without the nurses' station waiting for bill and leslie ann to pick her up and take her home they told me she's been doing it for a couple of days she did know me and kept asking where i thought she should wait then she asked me to take her home and i told her i couldn't than she wanted me to call them and see when they were coming finally i tried to explain they weren't coming and she asked who isn't coming [laughter] [noise] so [noise] my heart heavy i told her i had to go and last i had tried to get her to go back to her room but she kept asking me why i said that was her room so sad i surely hope i never ended up in that state <unk> if i do don't ever come see me a break your heart [laughter] i don't remember me as i was not in that condition and i'm trying to see if she said anything else about god um she said he was going up to baltimore for a week so she yeah she had <unk> um you know she told me down <unk> they have an offer house thirty thousand less asking price twenty thousand less than their bottom line and the people would negotiate susan is still concerned about her job i don't understand exactly what todd told me something about the hospital taking on a managed healthcare plan and then her for might be totally eliminated in which case you would have to resign from the hospital and applied to the managed care people are take whatever shift a hospital chose to give her no job outside of government seems to be secure these days teaching is <unk> <unk> he said neither of them is filed for divorce says it's just a formality and they get in the household is the first <unk> business <unk> can come later <unk> he said a v._a. lawyer who's planning to leave and open a private practice said he did it works for nothing that the only thing the court is concerned with this other properties divided <unk> will be very simple and the children are all <unk> tidbit todd said that julie has really butched in their hair cut it short season i always figured susan was the male partner in that relationship do two lesbians every <unk> <unk> <unk> oh innocent little me how much i have yet to learn [laughter] and it was about it yes no her mother she's the one who needs to get out and do some oh i know i did it just so now since i've been home i mean i love it but i do you know i i made for <unk> to come home at night and stuff you know i mean you know if i just went by myself like she is and i wouldn't go out much or do anything either well i can remember that like during the summer when i'm <unk> would be out of town you know during the winter it was okay 'cause i work all day and i had kids i enjoyed the quiet evening yeah but during the summer when i was there just by my own you know that's what i always came up and visited you yeah because you just get lonely right and uh i can't imagine i mean even grandma talked <unk> for an every day and <unk> regular almost every day that she went out and <unk> circle around <unk> yeah <unk> yeah <unk> that she talked to and yeah i just i just can't imagine <unk> either how she could stand it i don't know the i don't know either <unk> but you can't make her go out and get activities you know every she complains and criticizes everything yeah you know she did that volunteer work and she hated that leave that yeah yeah i tried one little thing and <unk> didn't like that yeah it's just like one afternoon a month <unk> <unk> did you have <unk> ordering that clock that she wanted <unk> oh i think you told me that and then <unk> or something yeah yeah <unk> and she didn't like it she would never order mail order <unk> yeah it's kind of the same attitude you know well i didn't like that volunteer into all never again yeah yeah and <unk> thinking that you know <unk> that was maybe not what i wanted but there could be something else there you know she her mind is just so close to everything <unk> yeah that's exactly what it is yeah absolutely closed and you just have to force her to you know what it's like <unk> stacey to open house i mean i wasn't really looking forward to that either but she wanted to do it and it would be okay and met her i mean for like two days before hand 'cause i'm just writing this i'm just reading this can imagine yeah yeah i mean you would have thought that she was going to be led to you know how <unk> recession or yeah and i said mother just do the food and you don't have to talk to anybody you know i said that's <unk> you can do that will help me out and it'll keep you busy and you won't have to mess with anybody i know i know but i'm just hurting that this is just not me i just want to shrink back and do my little corner you know <unk> and then i think she really enjoyed it yeah because <unk> quite social and talk to a lotta people and everything and she was just you know and i just thought you know i have had those feelings too but you just say oh it'll be fine and do it yeah you know and <unk> <unk> yeah i hope i never get that <unk> were heart of that is all the i've noticed the older i get the less outgoing i am in atlanta i do enjoy stuff like that so i'm thinking jeez and thirty years or twenty years or whatever you know yeah i hope i hope i don't yeah and and <unk> you know like i say we need to remind each other <unk> getting that way because [laughter] i am more and more you know things i used to enjoy doing i just don't care to do any more you know and a lot more people kind of things yeah like i see myself becoming more and more of a hermit and i i kind of worried that i'm too dependent on <unk> because he has a lot of friends that he has lunch with and yeah he and i really don't i mean he's about my only real friend you know i mean everything i do basically i do with him now <unk> good friends we went over <unk> and we had it was fun time reminded me when we when you lived in that little apartment we just late in the pool [laughter] burn up too but anyway i had sunscreen <unk> still got a <unk> about ten i guess i should say but i do have a couple like lowest i went to launch the other day and you know and i need to call debbie sit <unk> can't do much with her before she goes back to work and and you know there's people there <unk> land even two that i could if i wanted to talk to more to do things with them but i just i really don't you know and as far as going out or anything i never do i guess my thing is that i still see a lot of women do um the kids <unk> you know like you know i mean i went to tennis three times a week that i didn't stay except on fridays but fridays you know i would um because they play their matches yeah so i'd stay and diane would come and stay and usually carolyn would show up and you know we'd sit there and talk <unk> you know what i'm saying yeah and then you know <unk> now and then and catch up on things with her and you know just so i think part of it's just this neighborhood yeah you know you see people and you know people know <unk> like racist having a dinner party saturday night so we'll go down there and you know that kinda thing and like there's two or three of the gals walk all the time they're always walking if i'm outside and they come by you know they'll stop and talk so it's not you know there's there's people that i see and have contact with all the time even though it's just on a very casual basis i think men are even has that oh no she you know she doesn't that with our neighbors or <unk> or anything like that and that's kinda the same thing grandma had yeah people that she'd always lived around and been around and you know the bridge group and like i could play that <unk> that group if i wanted to i just don't because of working yeah but i always figure will some day with <unk> you know when the kids are gone and the other thing is that it's on wednesday nights and that's one of my life with kids yeah gone mundane thursday anyway but i figure you know once they're gone i'll <unk> i'll let them know that i'm a bit because they they always need us up yeah there's always some <unk> can come through by playing i'm only a sub but i play every month you know yeah <unk> and yet if you don't want to you don't feel obligated yeah don't you know <unk> and you don't have a habit i know yeah [laughter] and you don't have <unk> yes you know once the girls are gone all make him let them know that i'm available the <unk> and and you know it's just kind of like now there's just because you didn't because you know that's the thing about this neighborhood there's like a little small town yeah and uh and i'll always know these people as long as i live here and i'll always have contact with them but she just like isolated from the world oh yeah now she's just really yeah and i do worry that she's gonna die sooner because of that because i really think that most the more <unk> about daddy or something i worry more about daddy's health yeah his health is worse i think i think it is just you know that arthritic hunting and everything i love to be a hundred to answer to sit there and get <unk> here <unk> <unk> i don't know <unk> i just i'm worried about her because she just doesn't have any people i think you gotta have the people contact too i guess to keep your interest i don't think i think she'll just be you know like her <unk> stop kind of what should be a nice way to go but it'll just be more from <unk> you know not losing the will to live kind of you know not really wanting to die but just not really have anything to live for you know well you know she always says that thing about feeling needed and i almost feel guilty that i didn't need her this summer <unk> don't you know we don't since then you know <unk> you know and <unk> <unk> would you know she wants to like i figure next summer i won't have any classes take hopefully and [noise] we get her up here and i can all do things with her i'll take her to the outlet mall tell yeah you know i'll just think of some things you know maybe we could do a little house cleaning the morning and then think someplace to go or do in the afternoon or even if she would just i don't know i mean i like to work in the yard yeah and i don't know she probably wouldn't really like to work and i did some of that too i was so you know the days that i was off i would go run and then i wanted to spend and sometimes she would kind of come outside and smoke a cigarette and <unk> but yeah she could have just come out and you know 'cause i planted flowers and did some of that stuff when she was here and yeah you know but she didn't really mean mr nine joy that every night after he comes home we eat dinner and clean up and then we usually go out in the yard 'cause it's cool then yeah and we usually walk around and and you know with the place that needs to be waited so we'll stop and pull the weeds and talk you know and then we'll walk <unk> you know we we peruse the entire parameters yeah [laughter] and then we'll check the tomatoes and like a couple of nights ago we put miracle grow on the flowers and it's just a nice you know what i'm saying yeah it's cool and it's pretty outside and the stuff needs to be done your aid and then and then we usually end up getting a popsicle something and we sit on the front porch swing for awhile and it's just so pleasant nice outside to me it's just a real pleasant way down to spend the evening evening and you get <unk> and you get a little bit of everything done around the yard so it doesn't become completely overgrown with <unk> and stuff and you know i mean i would be perfectly willing just to do stuff like that was mother just to do things around and talk and you know enjoy each other's company while we're doing that but it's like you said you give her project and then she's like well i can't do that [laughter] so weird [laughter] it was just doing my windows i kinda started before i called you and and um she did like those four big ones you know and <unk> area there and that was [laughter] just lazy i just didn't want anymore and it's like okay but i mean already did those <unk> took five minutes i'm you know literally to do i mean that was it you know that we all that she had the energy to do dot <unk> around here now that i'm done with school i've got this i thought about your projects there thank god this place it's such a pet i mean that basement i'm afraid to even look at it [laughter] yeah that's pretty well straightened up and i say there's more of ted's crap and i didn't think he had much staff and i said the thing that so annoying it's like he had all this crap on the shelf and his master bedroom and the apartment yeah they had like this old this little tiny portable black and white t._v. and stuff when would you ever use that oh well see <unk> the same way he got stuff from centuries ago and and it's kinda like if it's something expensive or if it was expensive uh-huh not he doesn't want to throw it away right <unk> <unk> it's it's like a leather golf <unk> but it's gotta be twenty or thirty years old and i'll beat up [laughter] i mean it <unk> it is leather uh-huh and i'm sure it was very expensive and so it was out in the garage and so he said it out there and when he first did it it was like trash day and yeah he said it kind of by the trash cans i called and luckily it called them yeah and i said you know you want me 'cause he puts a trash out and they said you want me to put that <unk> what the trash you forget <unk> no i know [laughter] that that's why you set it up there isn't gonna put my <unk> said you are and it's real heavy and stuff yeah [laughter] never walk anymore he's riding the car and he said that's a really expensive golf bag and i said but it's old and it's all that stuff you know i'm going to use it don't throw it away i said okay well of course it sat there oh yeah the whole time so i finally just moved <unk> down into the basement you know but <unk> why would you keep that i mean because you just can't stand <unk> yeah because <unk> paid i don't know <unk> probably a couple of hundred dollars <unk> way back when or something you know and it's just like it looks like shit i would be embarrassed to use that money would ever noticed that it's real weather that <unk> a lot of money it just looks like an overnight bag you know <unk> <unk> as i put that down in the basement i moved and i don't know and then that box that t._v. and all that shit and then he's never ever open <unk> look at that stuff and you know and plus he micha stuff down there that when they when his aunt died and they cleaned it all out and he just moved at all but he has never gone through it that's what happened <unk> stuff is and and see i can understand said like they're just says a lot for the <unk> right i can understand their maybe things of hers in there he won <unk> yeah but my lord i mean she's been dead for almost ten years yeah you know what goes through it and figure well the neighborhood is having a garage sale september <unk> that i thought maybe maybe that would motivate made it through all this stuff and then i thought and maybe it would make some money for christmas too because i'm thrilled that they're eliminating that in service but it was like a check for three hundred and fifty dollars out yeah that was a separate checker yeah <unk> it's not a contract that's why they could eliminated and um and i always you know that help pay for christmas yeah when things are going to be tied anyway so i thought well maybe if i got 'cause i could sell shelley's old furniture you know there's some big things in their right that we could get rid of some back for <unk> get some bucks and maybe that would help supplement christmas a little bit we'll see yeah [noise] but anyway that's going to be a whole nother thing <unk> god with you know me having a sin four hundred twenty five dollars a month they the way right yeah but um anyway <unk> those things all work well i i should get my race and then i figure all sub class a day or so that that brings in some money is not the most something in the world to do but you know but it's doable yes it does bring the money will be prepared for them to cut us off <unk> <unk> oh okay <unk> boston and say we have to hang out oh okay well it always call you back and forth in the middle of anything yes <unk> big <unk> don't think we are but <unk> sleeping downstairs though well the girls have never <unk> they <unk> they came in and out and out last i started we went to bed at ten thirty and it started about eleven thirty and i mean they were <unk> the phone was ringing they were out and i said i mean which was like ready to get a gun and and so i finally got up and like <unk> stacey came home and then shelly and diana came in and they were all laughing and talking and i went out there i said you guys <unk> yet we can't sleep you know yeah and and <unk> they said well mom we're going

every the chicken and grandma saying that the people <unk> the time yeah [laughter] i know but you know it's <unk> phone ringing indiana i mean it's just it's just enough to drive you crazy and then i'm misty has her final organic mystery yes she's going into the final with the seventy one <unk> several passing seventy yeah yeah yeah [laughter] so she's got to do she's got passes final <unk> stand yeah so i hope she can pattern but of course that's a whole nother story that i keep saying why are you <unk> where are you being funny that she can get all those loans forgiven though yeah yeah and uh i do is work and some little town <unk> he went to some saying that they had for family practice doctors where they're trying to recruit the kids to go into family practice yeah and they all

about extending and she said well my mom said that um she would all want me to extend so there wouldn't be so much pressure and go seven years instead of six if it weren't for the money <unk> it doesn't matter about the money yeah yeah god so i don't know we'll see how she does the next year <unk> year anyways yeah they have to see which into something else is that possible er yeah i know you i mean they can only extend twice yeah then they they booed him out i mean that her career yeah she would have to do but i you know i still think with all those science courses everything she could

4365-0000000-0001140 i guess that that <unk> talk about the president then [laughter] i know i talked to dug go i i guess well <unk> well the thing is it does kind of annoying me a little bit oh why well the first <unk> first of all <unk> i i <unk> i think he's sort of knew he didn't i didn't want him to be here yeah but still he was someplace to bring people it's like how long are you going to be here uh-huh so i really don't think that it's very appropriate or so forth like you're on vacation i mean what what's the point yeah and it just sort of <unk> that that might of annoys me it's kind of uh for the ones that you know why he wants to bring people there right why well you know his boyfriends [laughter] yes but i <unk> i i'm sorry i don't want another lee worthy okay yeah <unk> and i don't i i'm i'm pretty good so i don't think it's beyond that okay huh i don't think it's <unk> well <unk> i think leaves actually little bit cleaner than is what i'm sort of kind of figuring out now after a while and i just don't like it you know what i mean uh-huh this is gonna motel okay oh okay and it's kind of annoys me it's like are you going to be showing up i don't care i'll show whenever i please so anyway and then anyway we're supposed to do something with the air i mentioned <unk> <unk> what we get together with eric or something friday uh-huh you know let's you know go out to a movie and so forth i wanted to see this <unk> species movie which was <unk> night yeah yeah but the thing is is that he never calls never does anything okay and so all i get now as it gets the message well i just <unk> i want to get a hold of the key when can get it wants me to straighten up or something it's like i'm not gonna straighten <unk> can be accurate <unk> sorry [laughter] and it just it just sort of annoys me yeah you know if you want to do do any of that other stuff just go somewhere else yeah i don't know <unk> know i just think it's bullshit i mean that's i'm sorry but it's i i know i just think you're getting a little worked new <unk> i'm sorry i don't get <unk> crap okay that's about it okay i i have to feed some animals now worry about that now and then this other <unk> over that what's that are you staying over there i'm thinking about it yeah yeah well then why not i just wish you had mentioned to me before you offer i did when i was kind of thing i was kind of hesitant yeah i i don't know if you asked me you mentioned it and then <unk> discussion after you've mentioned it to do but beforehand i've kinda been kind of like negative on it i don't know i just i guess i never really thought that it would be that big a deal you know <unk> well i mean i i i just think that it's largely because you're in a really high stress situation i'm in a situation where i need full control my environment i know i i so i was just i don't know but anyway he doesn't call and i just only <unk> mean friday and all <unk> get this <unk> only <unk> mean talking about a little bit rude i'm sorry <unk> really rude if you ask me it's just like well i i just wanna use you for something here i don't think it's like that well i think the behavior indicates that at least at least at least you know mister mister mister very sensitive and aware of other people's behavior is obviously not super aware of his own a little bit so but you know that <unk> acts abrupt like that anyway <unk> <unk> and i'll <unk> i'll have to brooklyn so it's it's sort of funny but anyway the movie was good yesterday though i i'm i i might come back monday what am i supposed to do you know you're not supposed to do anything i'll take care of it i i i am going to mention to him that i do think it was sort of rude that he didn't do that and all that good as this message blah you know well you could yeah i mean i think it's valid for you to yell at him for that you guys up and stuff <unk> wasn't <unk> official plan but it's not as if he gave me a number to contact him <unk> <unk> so i just i was a little bit i'm a little bit put off by it yeah you know and and i always say he could probably say that he felt put out by too so i don't think so i was the one who suggested going out and doing something the only thing he can be said put off by me is that it might <unk> life hangs in the balance and i would like to be left alone i don't think that that's unreasonable yeah you know i you know it's i know i agree but you know i'm also yeah you know uh you're not going to be there during the <unk> the way i kinda <unk> it's like if you want <unk> of a soft place to lie your head down fall asleep and wake up cook food or whatever and putz around once in a while that's fine but if you want a place where you know it's it's time for saturday night fewer party i'm sorry it's okay <unk> not quite like that yes but still that's kind of my you know he's got people that he hasn't seen for quite a while don't they don't they live somewhere [laughter] you know what i'm saying well i'm not all of them i mean i get the impression not all of them can you go back to that place i mean have you ever actually talked to him about it no but anyway well because some of them you know oh i understand i think i understand what you're saying though yeah i think i figured it out but yeah so he would like to have a place where they can come <unk> visit him yeah and so and so [laughter] it's never mind i thought a hilarious word play but anyway <unk> i don't wanna say [laughter] it's not it's not it's a it's a word play on what you just said <unk> which are really it's but it it it it comes when it comes <unk> there's some truth to it you know uh what what is it are <unk> are they <unk> they can visit him income they ruin uh-huh ah [laughter] this is coming and visiting <unk> yeah well okay [laughter] but i mean anyway anyway so my my my thought on the whole thing is that you know if if you visited him you wouldn't wanna have to be you know spent panting and spending every second of the day with him on line you know and <unk> and that probably part of the reason that it would be nice to actually stay with them and that you could also go and visit the sights or whatever where were you talking about in japan i'm not going to japan now but i mean i'm trying to maybe in ten years but no time soon but no you know what i'm saying when you are visiting in town and is that someone's house and you can't ever do anything on your own and stuff like that well i don't want any does stuff on my his own i just uh you know i mean there's a difference between guests and there's a difference between ownership i think i think that i know there i mean if if if i live somewhere you know i can rearrange the furniture staying somewhere it doesn't mean i'm i'm i'm in jail i mean just because i'm in a motel doesn't mean i'm going to repaint the walls but doesn't mean that i'm obligated to stay there either but i'm just sitting there different degrees of you know i i don't think he's obligated to sit there and hobnob around with me the entire time either i wouldn't want him to yeah you told them i say i have no time to do anything and i said well maybe that's why he was trying <unk> as soon as as soon as i moved back here he's out i i i'm i'm <unk> totally insist <unk> i don't care if you never talks to me again because there's no way i can study with worrying about keeping somebody awake or you don't have to worry how <unk> how dressed if i'm clean you know whatever yeah well i i agree with that <unk> but in that case i think that while i mean he can stay woman <unk> that was my point that was my whole point that what is the big deal <unk> giving him <unk> time to do what do you want to go make a copy too [noise] the um [laughter] well you know what i'm saying and i'm kinda thinking about saying well here's here give me a couple bucks america happy yeah or just give them <unk> give him your set a kids one day when you're studying and say here and bring it back you know go make a copy and then bring it back and <unk> i don't think that unreasonable for him now for me when i you know at least i anyway yeah maybe not you have offered long time ago that oh yeah you can stay here and blah blah and he knows that you're not going to be there so i think that you know i i don't think that's <unk> yeah i just think he needs to know that there are limits or whatever that i don't want it i mean i'd like to be able to come here during the day any time and not feel like if i need a book or something uh-huh i don't wanna feel restrained because it'll frustrate me uh-huh and i won't be able to come i think that that would be reasonable <unk> make an agreement with them <unk> <unk> what time you know after what time of day where you call before you come over yeah you know or you know so like between uh eight p._m. and you know ten a._m. and if i have to come over then i'll call first like that i mean i don't think that then reasonable you know or something like that yeah because then you can feel comfortable and you can feel comfortable because you know what's going on yeah you know and and <unk> you know you're gonna be at a suzanne's for what till the eleventh or something no till well that's right yeah when you come back i guess i'll be i'll still be there will be there right <unk> right so and then so just would you be over here packing at that time partially yeah partially sure of course i deposited your other rent loan traffic came in oh good how much and i was nineteen something okay if you know the thing is i took out two hundred and fifty <unk> the account i'm going to pay the electric bill i'm going to pay m._b._n._a. i'm going to pay some other people okay that and then there was like thirty five fifty thirty five it was like different i wrote to march next minute give him too you know it doesn't matter <unk> figured out and we get back i i haven't done any catalogue and all i've had <unk> figures my head i knew where everything is so i can do it very quickly but i just i just haven't because there's just i get so much meal but i mean i got a big pile that you're gonna have to look through what you want to keep it throw away i know i know and so i i've thrown away some of the junk mail but i haven't worried about most of it takes a lot of effort most <unk> anywhere and i agree i'm i'm so i i was thinking sending mom and dad um about a hundred bucks that's unreasonable for what off of what i owe them is this recent amount or your original loan <unk> out of them you know twelve thousand dollars or something yeah yeah <unk> where did you get my other postcard yet i mentioned <unk> no i didn't know how <unk> how are you going to work for this fall at all or possibly um 'cause actually i was i was thinking that in any case i think in some sense it'll be a learning experience and i don't know but when i talk to them uh in march <unk> didn't sound very optimistic about it as far as what that there would be anything any possibility because well partially because he wanted some <unk> long time and partially because they thought he might have enough people already and stuff like that <unk> okay well that's so you know i said okay well you know we can talk about it later and stuff like that but <unk> it's not and it just sounds like a kind of cool thing you could put on i know i know it sounds like a nice thing to do but i'm not sure that uh i'll be able to you know what i'm saying yeah um but i'll i'll definitely talk yeah 'cause we'd be cool if it was only like five hours a week because it would be just enough so you could get <unk> certainly an m._b._a. crazed anyway you know oh i know that i'm going to be teaching to classes and taking thirteen credit hours why are you <unk> why don't you take <unk> twelve or ten or something well because one of the courses had the correct with it so it's for credit hours and the other ones i need and and they have it so so ah you know possible that we'll just have to see that's nice <unk> um but getting the spring i got your um package but i can't get it yet one <unk> the mail room window is close <unk> yeah i know get your surprise [laughter] [noise] yeah you have to take a nap today <unk> came back from the <unk> party and <unk> had <unk> and stuff and i'll say tired well he's up late last night with eric talking <unk> he was fun to talk to you know when i called you're still chatting yeah and so each other for like three years wow um oh another thing i was talking to my mom and dad uh-huh and um i don't think i've talked to a what they recommended about investment yet have they <unk> um but i mean the thing is i'm going to worry about investment were out of debt you know i know that but but <unk> mother mom's a recommendation was that we should put <unk> that we said invest <unk> even though it's non money because that get started and you'll always put it off later no matter what <unk> and <unk> dad's recommendation was half the credit cards but then when they talk to made together and <unk> that kind of came to the agreement that it would be the optimal situation would be to invest two hundred and fifty dollars it didn't pass or not and then have credit cards and once you've invested two hundred and fifty dollars and that's one <unk> and then you can send in small amounts whenever you want but you have to make a two hundred and fifty dollar initial investment yeah <unk> <unk> worth worthwhile for them to isn't right and have it running through the hassle um yeah uh and i think that's a good idea i mean i'm really i think i'm really look forward to us trying to work a lot this spring i mean if you one class and i agree i work 'cause if we don't get if yeah if we don't get close to out of debt i will not <unk> i refuse to go to europe i mean that's i mean i'm going to stick to that now i'm <unk> i i'm i'm just saying you know it doesn't it help that i had a scholarship and that's <unk> yeah i think it's i think it's wonderful that's why i'm thinking that there is an opportunity i think we for you if you really you everything correctly it can be i'm not going <unk> i'm not gonna buy any stereo equipment i don't want <unk> <unk> ah i simply going to buy things which that we absolutely need or really help us in some special wave right now and uh-huh so forth <unk> was going to rain elmer of all things talking talking about if you go to i was thinking of i don't know why <unk> thought about this today uh well he was hanging around with this guy john who's in library science is and they were going out to the country to look at stores <unk> sounds like fun so it's pretty cool yeah what he's doing fine <unk> not too long ago and so so are you okay oh he does this <unk> computer for [laughter] it's nice and all but i mean i think you know i like it to an extent i would like to know more but i would never want to be into it like kids it's just not me i'd rather read some book yeah that's true it just kinda sexually for species was okay so that's good um oh um the other thing i was gonna ask you about <unk> mom called earlier today <unk> um i was talking to and she was saying that uh there is say <unk> that she was talking about gram and granddaddy she went <unk> to cut their line and stuff like that <unk> and um so what i said that i was hoping that you know and i could get down there may be the first weekend after classes or i'm <unk> you know the next couple of weekends to help them out with projects around the house that they got you know and and mom when i mentioned that mom i'm i'm you know i said well think about something that you guys need help with you know so that <unk> come down for a weekend and just really clean the house <unk> yeah exactly <unk> <unk> mentioned two things one of them was painting the fence outback and the patio cover and then the other one was um going through all my cried you know that got left there now and uh oh one one thing that i've told them that we have to stack everything right but <unk> have to go through it all and sell the stuff that <unk> that the extraneous jon you know they're buying <unk> the the in large slew of them yeah you're right um anyway so but <unk> you know 'cause i've got so much stuff left over there i don't know what you think about that though i think it's fine i think one of the first thing we shouldn't <unk> boxing's up get rid of or we don't want and get it all efficiently stored away and the room for um mhm your parents are they can use it for something right so i talked to the <unk> the other day was talking <unk> actually went into <unk> his birthday party <unk> that's where i talk to her but the other party with a lot of fun we we're we're being really crazy these kids were i think we're kind of weird <unk> [laughter] all of us for just we're being we're laughing <unk> really hard we're being <unk> just a lot of puns we're making we're just kind of sort of sort of like if the kids could of understood them they <unk> they would have been better [laughter] so it was pretty funny but um i talked to a talk show and the and the evidently she was she was like <unk> wild woman i've kinda who was talking about <unk> you can get a lot but ah i'm i was just kind of kind of put her back <unk> whoa you know it's kind of talking to her and she's like and she says well i'm always the one who initiate should juman scared of [laughter] a <unk> a lot of people i know where she has <unk> periodically and she just she just she just well we just share something that was fun oh well it's like she doesn't love anybody she has i think she <unk> <unk> actually it's sort of wonder if she has the ability to love she's very cold yeah she and <unk> you know could have <unk> her blood sugar and you know yeah of course a lot anyway <unk> yeah we should get a couple of postcards from <unk> probably monday or tuesday will get some postcards and and um and then we'll you know and then you come back and i'll pick you up and you just send email about what time <unk> and everything <unk> um yeah did you get my email that they should change changing the flight no i need to check your email <unk> i'm sorry i don't have time no it's okay but anyway so when it's gonna be than ah earlier on sunday earlier than twelve uh i don't know <unk> something about the flight recently yeah that was what it was okay so sometime around noon okay i don't know i mean we'll be flying out of albuquerque around seven or something okay are you being <unk> okay yeah <unk> it's about a three and a half hour four hours <unk> we're gonna probably still have all these interchange yeah exactly so um but anyway it'll be probably that'll be better anyway right 'cause we all be driving in the middle of the night you know it's true i i got my new glasses hey how did they say oh well first of all the <unk> sent you a letter kinda describing [laughter] my postcard about how are you <unk> people screwed them up they did what happened <unk> well the thing was when i first got them to frames essentially you know where the the stems that bend uh-huh they were <unk> they were probably for somebody with a slightly near or had been mine who they kind of pushed in a little bit so i've had this idea that i was gonna take a piece of sand paper removed <unk> little bit of this metal uh-huh and so they would open up a little bit more but not the forming the shape well when i get them back it looks like somebody said some fun with them or something you that they put <unk> put lens than there were a little bit not cut quite right uh so they actually would spread they spread them out a little bit leasing some sort of spread i mean they were like <unk> they were loose they were unwieldy on my face that's really weird and so i was sort of an order to go back what's that did you go back and tell them <unk> you know <unk> the girl i do you do you think i want this this you know this little girl the twenty two year old girl the fixing no way i'm <unk> i i i saw them and and i was kinda looking at him and she's <unk> she's afraid i'm just going to break them but she was just doing weird stuff and she had no idea what she was doing i mean talk to someone who's really in charge and say look you guys <unk> messed up my glasses and what did you <unk> they were very it's very subtle and i've had some certain hypothesis ease about what had actually happened to them uh-huh okay but <unk> they weren't totally breast but they look <unk> look they were bent out a little bit and they were sending to lucille and his anyway well i fixed okay oh that's okay yeah i mean actually i heated them up with the <unk> which <unk> actually <unk> lightly ever society <unk> almost i don't really care at all uh-huh slightly <unk> just colored the plastic little spots here and there and eat them up 'cause i guess the steam it's not as good as a hairdresser for some reason <unk> hot too hot or whatever but anyway so i i fix them myself now they could just perfectly fine and they look okay oh yeah but the thing is so sad is that nobody has noticed i have to tell everyone that was hard she's the only one that they mentioned it and she <unk> she could tell the difference she said well those are a little bit this way different and this way this way [laughter] that's right okay so you notice the difference okay like everybody else <unk> brother and my sister john paul eric nobody noticed [laughter] hell everyone <unk> i might <unk> see if you just okay yeah 'cause they're they are i i realize now that they're very similar [laughter] oh that's great although i i do think they look better in certain ways <unk> i've noticed actually weird thing is i've kind of notice that people kind of look at me a little bit differently now <unk> i hope hopefully i think in a friendly overweight [laughter] goes <unk> they look a little bit better my face like okay <unk> anyway <unk>

was it was um it drove really bad on the interstate israel wildly but i thought well you know it's just not <unk> i took it in to have the wheels on line and these guys go can you look at this and they put one of the rooms machine it was all bent bent big time i mean my nephew was hard on the car i think you have <unk> few times and things like that so the humor is kinda funny hey i gotta tell you <unk> did i talk to you since i went out on that woman that has forty personality you told me a little bit about the <unk> you know she got raped the other night or somebody [laughter] not raped the other night [laughter] got raped or and then when they were doing and then she says she called the hospital or whatever you said that was <unk> she got raped one she's nuts she's absolutely nuts uh-huh and she <unk> she asked the she told the nurse i want charlotte to come out and i'm like there's no sure one of the personalities no [laughter] that's a given melon one sure charlotte come out <unk> anyway she was she was referring to me because anytime i hear chelsea or something right there is no charlotte that there isn't <unk> and that's probably who she means and she's at in that and i'm sure it's the same way <unk> she called <unk> charlotte she called yeah she told the nurse i want charlotte they meet me at the hospital right and it's like we don't kind of charlotte but i'm sure that's me so i figured it must have been her anyway <unk> she's like real melon and she's really what really nuts uh-huh oh yeah she goes into those three year old boys and i think part of it is it's sad because whether she acting or not she still crazy and when she went <unk> so anyway i was with her that whole night right and then like two or three nights later she called the hospital again i didn't go out because i wasn't on call sure but another woman who works with me she went out and when they were doing the rape exam uh-huh they pulled out a cockroach out for <unk> oh my god anyway all i i just lost it because all i can imagine it's like you know and it's science <unk> oh my god i rode in a in a jar oh my god how do they get there <unk> i i think that she probably put it there or something she's pretty bad i i i seriously doubt actually got right now i i just don't well you know how <unk> how could you tell with with somebody who who is like that exact difficult episode certainly i mean with chemical <unk> with the kids that we used to work with <unk> you know and and he does a lot of a self mutilation earlier and stuff like that so that makes me think of fatal attractions last night <unk> yeah she has like the <unk> you want <unk> see my he goes into this three year old boy he goes and it's really sad i mean whether she's nuts or whatever uh acting or whether she has forty personalities are not she's still crazy but um she had like um cross mark upside down crosses on her stomach and i'm <unk> she she would draw <unk> god um i believe i mean she is a victim of ritual abuse that snow down right otherwise how would she <unk> she knows but i mean that <unk> that cockroach thing it sounds to me like either she one of her personality either participate in that kind of abuse that ritual now right sure that <unk> activity or it's real weird though i mean because i've talked with her so many times <unk> it's like i just have to she's she's really difficult to work with because she splits out until all these personalities three or four weeks i'm i'm like i when i was talking to read the <unk> i've never met you before i met <unk> which is good for my god i haven't met <unk> your salina right isolated salinas three actually like nineteen so weird though got real civil yeah really is how weird it is pretty tragic yeah so yeah anyway

country including america to wanna make a phone call anywhere in the world and he'll let us tape at least ten minutes ever secretly to use for accents and all that stuff <unk> give you free call so i thought oh this is one way i can call cheese shelter since i'm such a cheap bastard this'll be <unk> i've heard that about you [laughter] so have you been up to uh nothing really we've <unk> we've had a big change of uh leadership over here <unk> oh yeah and they <unk> changed the clinic <unk> change the clinic c. u. nurse changed and just trying to get a you know the feel for how everybody else's [noise] you know going to respond to them and now they're going to respond to everybody else has been trying to say the least for the past so probably month or so yeah so because last time i talk to you you're getting ready to come home for <unk> even thought you might even be getting hitched yeah well that didn't that didn't pan out uh yeah well what what i've done if my mentor the world's free as bachelor had gotten ball and chain well i mean that's still a possibility i mean yeah feeling <unk> the right time and those homelands so i don't know why <unk> oregon i still see you with some little gal flying around going <unk> san <unk> whole body <unk> [laughter] gets <unk> ass on the table no nothing like that going on over here yeah well i tell you another <unk> did you hear about martha getting married no what was supposedly it's gonna happen <unk> hasn't actually happened yet so maybe at ground zero i called her to chat whether i guess about two weeks ago um and she said oh hey bill uh by the way <unk> getting married if there's a typical martha pronouncement it's like oh okay are you talking about this guy how long you know and all that oh well i've been dating been since april but i haven't really told him <unk> thought well this is true cause martha you not been pretty good touch since april you never mentioned it but this guy supposedly they retired marine pilot um he just retired out so he's kind of thing we wants to do there i think for some reason <unk> six driver <unk> seems like they just really hit it off and click then i think he has one child but he doesn't have custody um so i don't have a whole lot <unk> they haven't set a date <unk> decide they're gonna get married and do it real informal and all this and i know [laughter] so i asked if he was drinking buddies with luke and that didn't go over real good [laughter] so i don't know a whole lot of soup but she's still in san diego and so you two settled pretty much there are in mind that i've changed <unk> last time i probably talk to you is what last spring yeah i know where <unk> where the world's best to keep in touch while i'm on the road now moving from new orleans and finally left the big easy and i'm going up to vermont believe it or not for graduate school oh you are yeah i find decided to go ahead and get on the ball and i knew i wanted to teach english as a second language as a career but i've never really done anything about it so i started doing it new orleans is a private tutor and then got picked up by little private school down there to teach for a couple of months in news is what i want to do so i got a apply got accepted into graduate school vermont who specializes in kicking you out into a one year master's program to do that so this starts in late august and i'm on the way up there kinda meandering up to the states and seeing anybody and everybody <unk> you're dead old behind was in the states i could make a point to go by and find you but since you're doing the land of large explosions i haven't been able to yeah well you tours what three years <unk> did you get no it's only two i've only got about six months left over i'm going to say i thought you're winded up you know where you going yet yeah twenty nine stumps you're kidding me no all good deal i think i know some folks out there yeah well you know i i called the detailer and i had originally i'm applied for fellowship to work with the joint commission on accreditation of hospitals <unk> which would have been a year long out service fellowship up in chicago which the the town that they had this <unk> been was like five minutes from where i went to college and <unk> minutes from where i went to high school right so i thought it'd be great you know but ah they picked some physician they go yeah so the only other choice they gave me it was either a great mistakes <unk> or twenty nine palms mhm and the detailer um and i said well let me think about it for a while and and probably forty five minutes after i hung up with her she called me back and said that <unk> the director <unk> nursing out at twenty nine palms mhm and the director <unk> nursing out there <unk> wanted me to be the department head for emergency nursing wow so i don't know this lady but um you know i've got <unk> <unk> especially in that under with the experience that i've got <unk> soon yeah <unk> yeah go ahead and go out there yeah well i was gonna say 'cause i know you're still the commander right yeah okay <unk> <unk> are you looking towards how how soon would commander becoming around the pike you carry a well being zone next next year okay so that when <unk> department head than if you figure commander would no no but guess who got deep selected for commander in let me think oh it's gotta be boring oh yeah [laughter] well now i also heard and i think i heard it's martha i heard barney had some kind of terminal disease well barney has cancer okay uh he had some sort of a um mouth and throat cancer yeah you know he's a big golf or write and golfers tend to when after they tee off they stick their golf tee in their mouth oh no yeah well they think that this cancer developed from the the bug spray and the weed killer that they put on the the grass oh man yeah so i i saw <unk> i was back in the states in march and um i saw barney and this convention that i was at and uses skinny as you are you're kidding me no good guy 'cause he was always built like a sealer something he was huge yeah and then you know you've gone through chemo news in the process of getting radiation so he like can you know one hair per square inch on his head yeah and <unk> could barely talk because that's where they were focusing the radiation right and and he looked he looked like death warmed over <unk> yeah you see the honest woods pictures and that was barney barney von lifting yeah yeah but then you know he worked for a general uh krulac oh okay okay you just said the magic word <unk> i got you yeah i've got another buddy who uh is a marine pilot i'm trying to think you'd ever met this guy i don't think so he um worked for him as an aid and so he was chuckling the other day <unk> probably the daddy other year when <unk> heard krulac had been selected to be the next big boy that he thought you know bill whatever happens <unk> i'm good to go there i'm going oh yeah yeah it was it was a real surprise there and when i talk to barney he wasn't we didn't really spend a whole lotta time that the the cancer yeah but i i asked him i said you know <unk> some point blank and said <unk> what the prognosis was yeah and he said poor um but you didn't say terminal yeah i'm okay i think i kinda assume then i guess from talking to martha because she may have over glorified i don't know well you know and barney's wife barb is down in sansabel mhm and i talked to her fairly frequently than that and she just um a couple of months ago mhm and then he was starting to gain weight back again so super you know i don't know whether they manage to get all the cancer with the chemo and the radiation or or what but uh yeah i i knew when <unk> came out i didn't even have to look you know because i knew that both barney now we're um eligible <unk> not the end zone but eligible mhm yeah i knew of anybody he would be the one that would be deep selected well being and buds with old chuck krulac didn't hurt things <unk> <unk> oh no not at all and you know when i ran into him uh in march <unk> the some symposium in san diego nurse corps thing yeah and then enroll engel the nurse corps admiral was there and yeah barney knows her like their best buds [laughter] oh yeah and then we're new pictures with vice president sons on stretchers uh no not yet [laughter] i would expect to see him taping <unk> chelsea any day now well wouldn't surprise me either emergency surgeon barney berens flown into white house today he's he's talking about going in d._c. next that you gotta spend a year in san diego for follow up yeah and then he'll probably go back to the admiral stances but i guess yeah i got another laugh too when you're talking about old names you remember john's otto yeah well he he breezed into san diego have <unk> call martha and i've got the whole history onyx i'll just <unk> you know i don't want to go out he ended up totally blowing her off i think to where she was waiting for a couple of hours and then came roaring up on a motorcycle drunk or something and said yeah you know what's to eat and stuff like that just moved <unk> here and then after the whole episode called her back later didn't remember it ever happens said yeah we've got <unk> got together gather some time [laughter] so i think this is what preempted martha to uh all her old beaus are definitely losing it they get <unk> get married and <unk> think we've gotten the other news i haven't been as much in touch with the other folks do more than they usually have at least keeping abreast of things i think pete and jennifer still there and you know she picked up lieutenant commander yeah i saw jennifer the same conference okay and she still look like <unk> teutonic opin up mhm oh man although her a hair color is getting a little bit darker really and she's <unk> she's not bleaching out quite as much i know she was a police behind are you kidding me oh yeah carried shoulders man i never knew this i thought she was one of these natural teutonic blinds no no no no no she's she's dirty blonde i mean she's she's blind but it's not the way

pilot money and <unk> said and i had a little bit from dad the states i decided i'm gonna take a couple of months i really decide about this e._s._l. thing <unk> want to do this and take a good month

together and we decided to go to disney world and we went down <unk> great vacation is the greatest place in the world came back um had a good time and she was understanding i wanted to go into <unk> some schools to get a masters in e._s._l. and that we would think about the idea of said she was still in california where this great part time deal of her company sending her to e._s._l. school they're paying her salary the same time that she really wanna think seriously i would be willing to talk about the idea of moving in together out there <unk> as long as they didn't compromise my plans to go and get this degree yeah so she knew it was a possibility but i guess you gotta fix her mind i was going to go to san francisco <unk> any route she had to go back and early november decided she'd come back and <unk> for christmas has been another <unk> and we'd find a lousy planned if we wanted to try and do this move thing so she came for christmas and i could tell from day war and she was just kind of not herself so i you know you know i don't know what the deal is here she's japanese are emotional strategy different uh i'm not quite sure what's going on she may be a spy for the the japanese mafia who knows <unk> finally forced to like you know <unk> <unk> what the heck is going on here and i had forgotten i told her on the phone because she was getting all upset about a lot of things that fact she had other boyfriends that she's young without worried about that and said ah i don't care you know that's just the past i said you meet and you're so worried about powell she says oh bill i'm so worried all the time you go back to palestine humid <unk> impossible i mean she was even here this summer and we decided to make a complete break the things i know that has your interest in her and i can tell you for a fact now she is not any of my future was set of hearing that all you mean <unk> course was <unk> was here this silver yeah and so uh that became a big deal so anyway the christmas she was saying you know i just can't get out of my head that she didn't tell me about that if someone allen feel like a big dishonest characters like what <unk> told you that show you how much trust his error the fact that she's totally out of my life you got no worried all 'cause human kept <unk> i'm so worried about powell thing [noise] so anyway we finally get into one big argument and we never had <unk> before you get all stressed out and we decided she was just gonna go back early that we were still you know close and everything but we just need to both settled <unk> cool damage he'd get this thing so she goes back just before christmas so this was made it a great christmas goes off <unk> california where you know <unk> that time and i thought well let's call each

real nice guy that you tell <unk> embarrassed to be on the phone so i have you know i don't know <unk> guys are have any problem with the <unk> the <unk> wish the poor bastard luck but um [noise] i said basically does humid there are <unk> touch with her what she said well bill uh hang on a second got back <unk> i don't think she wants to talk to you so i was like okay well you know tell her i said a chow or whatever and that was it and boy our hot because after all this you know invest the time and <unk> was all this all be like you <unk> also too you know yeah i think she was working if not the green card angle she wanted to stay in california so she probably had another boyfriend out there and decided a if a scout marry me and my ideal is made so of course at that point once again is forrest gump would say swore off women again <unk> decided <unk> get in trouble again and this is what it really got funny because i just devoted myself the academics and uh you know when <unk> made <unk> grades you into university new orleans for that one semester and had fun doing that and was working part time as a private tutor teaching english <unk> and then a guy accepted the school in vermont and started making plans to roll up and get out of there <unk> memphis gal from germany [laughter] <unk> figured out what it is scary it's a <unk> a tribute to them in world war two is that what it is since the access screwed <unk> i've been screwing the access because i was engaged to an italian girl relationship with japanese girl and when <unk> got very involved with this german girl <unk> looked it up in the history books and technically romania within the access so i need to pick up a gypsy and i'll be complete <unk> well you know it got it got better and better but i went ahead and cut ties to the marine corps or if you could i don't know if you're a big navy times reader you might see my recording there [noise] oh no i didn't well but you know they have a marine corps addition now too yeah and uh after i finished with the counter drugs saying they had how these promises about bill used a great guy who was an active reserve program coming up you'd be super for it and that <unk> that was like <unk> car distorted crumble and i could see a lot of politics and stuff going on and a lot of people who are coming <unk> bringing their boys and so to speak yeah if i knew that wouldn't be a future and i just asked them <unk> <unk> what do you guys want me to work for the next six months or not 'cause technically i can do that and it was kind of him and han human home for the last day i'll find salem walk <unk> i'll just get into a little reserve units somewhere if i want to do reserves stuff yeah and uh they owed me let's see about a month and a half too much pay 'cause the system shut down on pay me just before that plus the only travel pay for all these exotic places that going to the counter drugs so it took about six and a half months for them to pay me and about two months into it i figured out that one set of paperwork had been sitting in a sergeants desk and literally had just been shutting the desk and put away and and i got better and better so finally i went up through all the chains command you know went through administrate change hit every week it on the line and nobody uptay <unk> curls would give me a straight answer whatever said okay let's just write the navy times in a fax them an article and they put it right in the navy times and i've got a check within a week at the same time i told him you know that's this is kinda for me guys you've romeo and this and plus i knew if i was gonna go overseas and teach carry i didn't want to get recalled the buys me when i'm you know just checking into animals and we're so i went ahead and cut ties in an old maid you <unk> yeah he retired and he kept in close touch with me and written recommendations for a couple of grad school and said you know bill you may think i'm a strange one to say this but i think you ought to cut ties you've had good time you've done find stuff sounds like you're in a real political bunch of b._s. down there and just you know <unk> <unk> and going to do whatever you want to do [noise] so i'm now civilian bill i had my beard for awhile but the <unk> gone [laughter] i know knock knock you over with a feather still have the moustache still actually have a bill poor moustache long hair long <unk> long hair <unk> long hairs probably like you know male academy regulations for me [laughter] okay right i've had it i tried i was gonna grow a ponytail and i figured out i couldn't i drew these two things down the sides of my head that looked like i was a jewish <unk> lay reader or something but i couldn't get <unk> until the go so i kept it fairly short and that's the way <unk> plus our decide you know if i started <unk> law may find that i have bald spots so yeah well let's keep us safe and they're not bringing the extra gray and then i don't need that grease and formula boy i tell you what works at the store so now when you're does this um e._s._l. <unk> course yeah i'm <unk> where you lived in europe no actually i want to go back to asia but <unk> got to spend six months on an age where the marine corps and you know three that <unk> <unk> yeah and uh literally ten minutes and korea just go with an airfield so i thought about it and for a few reasons first is the pay is the best over there and a demand for english teachers it's just that <unk> <unk> and it's it's huge in china vietnam and it's always had big and japan and korea so i'll have a year course workout finished juice sixteenth of ninety six and then hopefully be going into a teaching contract right away and have two years ago <unk> thesis and if i had my druthers and this may change of the wind but if i had my druthers i think i would want to go to japan or korea because <unk> got <unk> much more modern living standard but you still can make outrageous books if you were in our age you panic or she can make huge books it's just try not to spend them yeah when i got into a a a parochial school with a t ninety little school called the school for international training in a little town in vermont and i mean it's it's sole purpose is to really teach people to either teach english uh in the states or overseas yeah and uh i thought you know paying back grad school loans plus the fact that i i love japanese cultural and i'm gonna go to asia i think a plus the fact that i still find rental girls extremely cute well hey you know you may want to think about staying away from <unk> tokyo <unk> well that's my first idea i have no desire but tokyo um and i know that it's not so much here and <unk> <unk> yeah but you know like hiroshima <unk> um i mean they you know you could probably get a job but they're all over <unk> <unk> well one of the universities that they're right you know i mean they they're probably die for people in the cost of living on this part of the island down here is not nearly as bad as it is in tokyo right so <unk> you know <unk> closest everything is if you really want to see tokyo i think it's a great place to visit but i wouldn't wanna live there oh yeah have you been up to colorado huh that was i was thinking about all the japanese people tell me not to go cause it's cold but either where you are down in the south are up in the north <unk> or my first couple of choices because i think you're right <unk> get away from tokyo any universities um you know in other places are screaming for people because all the americans that just want <unk> teach <unk> want to go tokyo or killed or whatever and all the pros want to go to the big universities in tokyo and all that and you're right the ones that seem to be just the ads obscene <unk> ahead of time they're always screamed for people are like a girl junior colleges and you'll highest level and all that <unk> would you need some girls high school <unk> believe me i'm not <unk> [laughter] i can just see but the first talking <unk> <unk> he says not to five hundred dollar just <unk> one time [laughter] and i think it's just that if you need to ah if you want to read [laughter] there's this one guy met down your walks has a retired navy commander just got out name hank ah baldwin and hanks a trip you would really like this guy he's into running but he's fairly normal guy and he had been stationed in south america few times and done e._s._l. the sly and he to kind of feel that you love to do this and he thought wow they'll pay me for this i says gravy and he was just dragging i'm going to go to to ah south america you know you gotta you gotta go peru bogota columbia the women are just kill you or your there's one place i don't want to go with short hair and always <unk> drug country yeah but i think age is the place and like you say it's it's to get away from tokyo or i think would be the key off huge number of americans i mean just go but i decided caribbean thirty three and this <unk> second career i gotta have some job security and i think the masters <unk> do that 'cause i know you really want to stay for a career oh without a doubt <unk> exactly and it's it's a stepping stone other places i got into a special dorm program up there um at this little school that proctor and gamble japan division promotes and they'll give you like <unk> i'm going to be in a sweet instead of just like little dorm room i being a sweet with the japanese executive in a different comes in every month and while i'm going to school i'm just kinda running buddy i have a couple of meals a week with them and kinda just teach them informal english yeah and just helping relax and look around vermont and for that i get this week and also that's another way to make the the good box is to get hired by a company in japan to teach the employees english yeah and it just to make some contacts and ask these guys you know what <unk> would you recommend you have a second cousin when your mom <unk> works in a hiroshima or whatever and uh you know there's there's just a ton of people here on base <unk> teach <unk> town right and you know they're making like fifty bucks an hour exactly um and actually some of the the ones that have been <unk> the getting <unk> some of the good programs get like fifty bucks an hour <unk> student right you know so there's a lot of money to be made <unk> and some of these people are are filipino who don't speak english very well i know what she <unk> and that's the the other big draw for japan and they say bill if you'll go as a six foot american you'll always get hired because the japanese people know that <unk> teachers are japanese <unk> yeah oh yeah they got <unk> say you know these gasoline come over <unk> they don't want to say <unk> it's <unk> the winery meet you yeah so i i'm looking forward to it plus i i'm just gonna have a blast doing it and it's one way to afford living overseas if i decide i'm just had it with overseas the job market exist that america for this and just getting a lot bigger oh sure yeah because you've probably heard about all this legislation liking california florida where they have to teach in spanish as well and it's <unk> much opposition to realizing well if we're gonna teaching english we need to start really open up our english teaching programs you know and <unk> have made some contact with people do it in the states and just realized i would give us some time before i made an investment doing this and so i did it privately and i've done it as a volunteer and just kinda ate it up and and i could see <unk> english teacher anyways i'll see you set up with your five hundred a l._b._s. family lives down in southern <unk> the phillipines you'll be going to change the subject here <unk> you'll be surprised to hear that the three days a week i run in two days a week i go and lift weights at the gym or you awesome <unk> are you a monster yet no not yet but the i dunno ever get to be a monster but it's a don't feel bad <unk> backed awful lot 'cause i finally decided to go to the old advisor just staying fit and so when i when i think about it i do run you know <unk> when it's not too hot and none of this second al at noon b._s. then and then when i think about it

for <unk> right right <unk> i know well obviously be now because he has a headache and even to just see you're crazy but you know and i also spelled my girls today <unk> they have to fast that i don't remember that we ever fed <unk> much <unk> [laughter] i said to me all day long really they are hungry that their stomach hurts their head hurts <unk> staying there there's the any time that i was around them or near that they were oh fetching and is it hot there actually today it wasn't too hot i um it was very nice but usually it's hot and still the evening and then in the evening <unk> tough weird i'm sitting here near the window and i had like cool air no fan snow air conditioning <unk> well that's good 'cause here it's been really really hot but today it was pouring so [noise] i haven't even gone outside yeah the states <unk> yeah i was in the house most of the day but then i had to go to the kids to do some stuff and then i came home and wasn't out the whole day and then in the evening we all hung out on the grass meet you rise you know <unk> that out ah well that's good yeah and then as time goes by and we're fitness right and you all waiting for <unk> come home he's coming home soon <unk> august twenty eight twenty nine <unk> wow <unk> his apartment ready no because he's <unk> he's silly i he could you could have done it already they decided that they'd rather come here and take care of it so [laughter] okay they're going to live in a different apartment and so they finishes even i don't know saved them tainted it yes well i guess you couldn't decide what you wanted to do or i maybe she wants to see what other people have done you know she only knows american style she doesn't know israeli style now yeah no i'm sure she's bringing everything with her anyway i i would assume but <unk> their apartment that they're thinking that was the one family the crazy people that really didn't do the living room normal and they didn't put in the sliding door they closed and made a window so that lady told you the awhile ago that they want the sliding door to the port so that effects uh-huh um and then they said like from the parent my room to the bathroom they did a door instead of having like we have the my son's there oh no no so that's nice in a way because you could walk through instead of walking around the whole house to the bathroom [laughter] and my <unk> you know it's all right and then the kids you know she had laugh like the hallway <unk> wanted to leave the hallway 'cause it was an art but it really made everything small <unk> kitchen was made figures i think they said down but other than that <unk> anything else they haven't found yet <unk> how about your house well we're just about finished we have a few i didn't in to get done but um it's very nice i can't believe also that you live you live <unk> <unk> in the house well the beginning was really a lot of fun every day i'd come home and see what they did and it was exciting in the end right before we left for <unk> they they broke through so most when we came home and we didn't have a bedroom and the kids were always near bedroom that it was just us so we just slipped downstairs for a few months but it it's definitely worth it it'd famous a couple of things we're still waiting on but basically it's finished everybody's in their room and more carpet he did and [noise] yeah so it's nice you're happy yeah very nice you know there's always little bits and pieces of aggravation but it's yeah well nothing can be done right but it's still very nice very nice and so i'm sure mommy told you but we're planning to come to israel well i'm in december and december the beginning not not like christmas time <unk> for the conference and you <unk> you know i think it's in tel aviv oh that's nice we never go to that and then i said to him and his new tanya real close to tel aviv yeah yeah right color into your yeah let her know learn the media [laughter] no anyway his confidence is i think the the week like the twelfth or something i loved that we'd so we're probably gonna come anywhere from seven to the tense and we'll stay a couple of weeks or i'll stay a couple of weeks i don't know how long he's going to end the is it around <unk> hanukkah is like the second week we would be there so that's that's like on one hand is very nice but on the other hand it's hard to hear that <unk> have a fit right so um 'cause i had originally thought we'd go later you know <unk> the week a conference in the week later but it's not gonna work <unk> maybe the i don't know when <unk> but anyway so that's about what we're going to come we didn't finalize anything well it's great it whenever you want to come you can kind of well i just have to tell you that um i didn't really tell mommy not because i'm i'm hiding anything i just didn't know exactly how to explain it i moved up in my life i'm going to be that could <unk> <unk> no oh my god they finally kicked out that <unk> know <unk> well he's giving me a happy <unk> so have you <unk> like he's training me now to but why did it take him so long to give it to you know for years they asked me a couple of times like they actually before dog and they asked me once even before you see a few times and i kept saying no i can't handle it i can't do it really well also i'm right and it took me almost all year to decide you just very good <unk> why i've been doing it without him being for it and we thought a lot of pounded i'll tell you why it's a job that that you have <unk> side of the fact that a lot of responsibility i told them are you sure you want to give me this this thousands and thousands of <unk> you know it's hard <unk> that you have to buy and take care of it you know but aside from that uses worried because you have to deal with the people here with us no matter how hard you try or how much wanted food everybody everybody complains right you know it's like the job that no matter what you do nothing is is going to be right it's also hard it's the twenty four hours <unk> on your head you know like even though today was just above i waited for about an hour because people were preparing everybody's learn <unk> and see <unk> tomorrow so i went for about an hour and <unk> was there and afternoon he called me he was there like for two hours preparing the vet floor you know it doesn't matter that it's a fad say no one's working <unk> have two day the bread came <unk> came today so you would think in israel and the people would not be working but i guess everybody else is everybody else says but well <unk> yeah i'm unfortunately not everybody is religious but i think that <unk> theoretically you could take it as a choice to say either as a instead of getting it off if you wanted to take it off from work a personal thing yes today we keep fit i mean here we don't nobody works just tore nude hearing there any way to make a long story short it was the <unk> it would took me a long time to finally decide and then i made a few demand because expenses that whoever was that can <unk> for the last <unk> at least five years i won't say eight years that i worked with the kids <unk> they had it easy because i ran the kids <unk> right now no one's here to run the kitchen and i said i'm not going to do this without someone you know that's not fair for all the work that i did and even i must admit delve even ones take me a compliment she said it would be easier to find it that can now and then to find someone to replace me [laughter] and i did the menus and i did this <unk> and i made sure that everything ran and was gone and done and you know and now i have to do all of that and i'm <unk> who's gonna do it well so they put you remember my craig the argentinian girls powerless oh right [laughter] yeah i'm not so thrilled about it i also feel bad for her she says <unk> the the kitchen two weeks ago and now she's in charge but the truth is kidney we'll have to take more the guy that we have the cook uh-huh i'll just have to take more responsibility some filled doing every night i write them exactly what to do all day long <unk> the only problem is now the girls <unk> like the in the next two weeks and then we don't get the new girl since september for the new girls come in and then i'll have to sit down and change everything and tell them to do it you know instead of the way all the things i want them to do that that has to do the truth is originally um what's your name <unk> that was opposed to going to go into the middle <unk> but then all of a sudden i heard that she didn't <unk> said yeah she wrote it she said she would do it and then i heard from the that she didn't say yes exactly she wanted to go to school but it didn't work out and <unk> said maybe we're back to you know not not another hobby ride and the kids <unk> will have to see but you know it's like i was adamant about it and then i was adamant that i have a good helper <unk> so now they're just die from the very much not very serious so i'll get him out of there and we'll get someone from based on the right word if everybody from the <unk> goes off <unk> got to go find people know the truth is also you know everyone tried to convince me it's moving up at it's doing other things and it's you know it's a big responsibility it's <unk> like you get a raise [laughter] yeah right you don't already raised more headaches and less sleep at night and the truth is even when they would tell you that let's see do you're moving up and so he takes away your wife do it right he says i i you know i'm going to it so now i'm at a point that it's very strange like i can't i won't complain about anything or i can't complain about anything and i can ask them to come helped me in the middle of the night when i forgot to take out something offend the freezer so we'll see what <unk> was hopefully i mean they promised me you know everybody that they're going to help me and whatever i say well you know everybody gives you these <unk> yeah you've already started wife started working with <unk> like i i don't cook anymore i haven't worked in the kitchen kitchen for weeks already i've been doing with him learning how to do the orders and meeting all the um sales people and um i learned how to work the computer which is a pretty good i said i don't know how to turn it on you know i'm not i don't know if i could do it by myself but he's showing me seeing me and i think like the middle of this week he'll be there a few days it's me and then and that he um maybe here and there but he's really basically is what is he going to do he's going to be a teacher for um high school computers oh okay yeah so he's only teaching three days a week so he always says it another day just made him he'll come in the truth is he's been teaching and very patient and very good and he also is great that he has written down everything i'm sure he's thrilled to get out of there well i'll tell you the truth i mean now that i worked with him when he was he does do everything was his heart i mean it's not <unk> he's just he has a different head than everybody else like i know that <unk> everything to be nice to be good and but he's very stubborn and he'd only <unk> doesn't like to listen to other people's um ideas but i'm i'm sure financially who's <unk> great for the keep us 'cause he was cheap yeah because he's also i'll tell you i worked with him this whole week he doesn't need the ever like all morning long so he doesn't eat he doesn't drink coffee either i didn't see him drink anything water or anything of that i better drink something out of the headaches and it's really hot [laughter] but i don't know he doesn't eat anything and then for lunch when we finally went to go get them and see <unk> like a little what we would eat maybe half for a meal and that's it so i can understand now why he thinks that the because he doesn't have big eyes right and that's so fun anyway no so he had agreed to do it for a year and his urine silver are you excited it all about isn't <unk> i'll tell you the truth until i made the decision i was scared and also <unk> i miss the cooking part i miss it that's fun yeah yeah like this week even when they made the <unk> the um coleslaw <unk> you know kept penny kept telling me to taste it and make sure that it was the way that i do it at tough matty said to me ellen you didn't make the call size is over you know <unk> <unk> <unk> where everything and they're going to notice the cooking is different well that's what even ruthie says you know everyone thinks that they can <unk> but there's a lot of things that are very important <unk> the kitchen and we'll see right now we mon a you know cocoa she got married she married that guy <unk> not the israeli guy not the <unk> guy but now you're kidding well then that happened fast because that little feminine kind of guy never remember when i was there in october she had that guy from your <unk> name that <unk> that pay money nah no money die was over um it was over already around then but they were still <unk> said listen guy was a high <unk> did hear something drawer he's um i think his family's romanian something anyway yeah it was very fast and they got married how old is she she will be he's eighteen and a half she'll be nine humid <unk> oh my god why did they allowed that well i guess they didn't have a choice that the worst the worst thing was originally when she came to her parents <unk> going to get married <unk> get married in october she got engaged before pesach for the students don't get married <unk> october so they weren't so for that at least okay it's a and then all of a sudden they came back and said no we want to get married they got married the first season i think um and we get on the bus yeah was <unk> was beautiful they do weddings we'd do today we do wedding so much nicer than in the old days for all we read tables and chairs yeah <unk> and we'd sit it on the grass outside the <unk> cells and it was beautiful today is like the first child who got married right and we rented beautiful china and silver wearing wow beautiful it was really i must admit it was really really beautiful and then serving everything we use like i'm all different kinds of not paper but all different kinds of bought kind of um paper plates uh-huh oh like the <unk> hard plastic and <unk> i it was amazing they even had like a bar set up and they <unk> they had hay and then they had food was gorgeous it was absolutely <unk> she now have to do some von or no no no such <unk> mary's is enough <unk> um what else he's working now in the vegetarian kitchen and it's every a little bit but she's going to study in september so that's not so long since she cover here no oh that other guy was real from this one is i and i'm <unk> from a family that's not from at all but he's yeah they went to america for a month after the wedding her grandparents sent them even though they were mad you know the typical ariella story they came for pesach and then they told them they waited to tell them that they got engaged and the weddings into that they were so angry because how the hell did they come back after not seen you know it's on one hand i understand them it's not fair <unk> of course not even they could've called them before pesach maybe they would have changed her <unk> yeah not ten sister was here also subs so they were all upset <unk> grandparents didn't come back for the wedding but i don't know <unk> you know <unk> i can't believe she got married she got married and then the week after ta'al paer got theories you know toddlers the oldest <unk> yeah where's she living well her has he looks like he looks like mickey our mickey yeah when mickey was really young so he looks really young he's <unk> she just finished mailed the army and she met him during the army he someone non religious people oh my god yeah so now they're living on his he bloods um because they allow like b'nai magic to live there but they can do whatever <unk> yet do whatever they want until they decide what they want <unk> see what they want to study what they're doing his parents aren't even living on the kibbutz anymore because <unk> the professor of something or rather read a lot of time hours somewhere singapore out of nowhere anyway so that was really weird like when she got engaged as a little hard for <unk> because he's not religious everyone was really upset she would think at least in israel you would get what you want snow but not only that what this kid just left the keyboard that eighteen and nineteen some back with <unk> you know like the also had a lotta different boyfriends during her lifetime anyway to make a long story short she had her wedding also but hers we did like i'm a buffet so i was really nervous about that because when did we ever do bisay did the tables and chairs again and we rented all the beautiful dishes but we set up people say we fought like these really nice you know they they're well we saved them 'cause you could watch them they're made out of plastic but they look like silver tray uh-huh yeah so we bought all different shapes and sizes and we put up the salaries of me send the all different kinds <unk> we had them <unk> little cocktail hot

was like a circle <unk> girls a circle of her friends <unk> circle of his friends because there was enough room the kids had a circle that you could have like five six different circles all over the <unk> oh my god it was beautiful and ta'al's what happens even though <unk> that was really worried that people were fans or be happy for i don't know why that was ridiculous that everyone was just as happy but her bad and they got stuck somewhere and they're um something with the electric equipment they it didn't come so we had to get from us the amplifiers and ours are terrible <unk> let me hear anything so people <unk> some people got really you know just you didn't they didn't dance and she was really upset i said well why did you even bother paying that was <unk> getting this really great

drops or something and going without her case yes she may go every year every year good because it man they told me she told me that dumb ira yeah left <unk> she says <unk> except that i think he's still working on keep but they needed him so much that they left <unk> and he goes to parents seem works there and they pay him it could be for a while i don't know how long is because of the yeah the truth is that um a lot of people left <unk> see this summer i don't know what happened there exactly but um his wife was <unk> the teachers don't lose these folks are one time about it so it's not so much that they weren't happy they i don't know she feels that <unk> that <unk> especially on the what the you know you can never move anywhere it's like you're always going to be you're always parts americans every always the younger the name <unk> get the better things are good to move up and i don't know i really felt or she felt that he was working so hard and <unk> never saw him at least if he was working for them you know i don't know <unk> just stuff that i guess they never really had food phrase serves because they like they yeah but it's a weird because her sister in law was much

4484-000000-000907 [noise] okay um i personally don't know a whole lot <unk> i'm twenty one years old and i don't have any children [laughter] you don't have any children but um i babysat and stuff and i think about having children [laughter] so how about you [noise] well i have three children and i've used various different kinds of daycare over the years um i think actually the hardest time to find good daycare is when your babies very young oh really i'm because they can't tell you what's going on the worst experience i had was when i was working when my um [noise] oldest child was a baby and i thought and i just i use the lady next door to me and you know it was close by and it was convenient and he always came home clean and what have you but i discovered that her way of handling conflicts between little kids once they started crawling and stuff <unk> very different from what i want it oh my son she always interfered and i understand that when you have a um [noise] you know when you have a bunch of kids and you have to make sure that they're all taking care of and everything else you can't let things escalate mhm but she would deprived the environments in order for the kids not to fight and then just stick them in front of the two oh wow and i i you know and i didn't discover that until later on and <unk> decided to quit working anyway but i decided that actually that the hardest time to find good daycares up to eighteen months old maybe from six weeks to six months you can do but once you're baby starts crying and stuff and then until they really start talking [noise] it's i i find that's the hardest time <unk> how old are your children <unk> right now they're seven five and three oh wow yeah so but then once every two months old you can often find good preschool times with situation mhm but i think it's real important to check how you want social interactions handle and how the school or daycare does it <unk> you know the other things to check they always tell you you know checked to make sure that there's continuity of care that your child is going to have somebody that they can make an attachment to stick with right what other kinds of things have you used <unk> like a daycare center <unk> well i use something sort of like a daycare center um for my youngest one when i went back to school last year and it was something that was partially funded by the school and it was outta y._w._c._a. oh that's nice and that was pretty good the biggest problem i had there actually was that they they try to provide continuity of care but they kept changing the number of people that were in the program <unk> you know people drop out of school and so the kids would drop out of the program and the <unk> and so and somebody would get sick and they'd start shifting people around one room to the next and um that was really tough on my son because he made a real strong attachment with one particular caregiver and then that one cat switched out of his room but he he adjusted to it pretty well but that that was tough on him and they they did their best not to do that it's just that you know they kept having 'em because they were using students to provide the care and because of the population of people who are using the care that became i'm much more of an issue with uh yeah so you would <unk> it sounds like the most important issues continuity care <unk> well <unk> mean when you say that <unk> other words they should have the same person taking care <unk> oh i see okay stay the same face the same and see different people even yes a daycare center or a home or school or something has a philosophy as to how to deal with certain kinds of situations <unk> not every individual applies that philosophy and the same way [noise] that makes sense and so it's nice for kids to have a chance to get used to how things are going to happen so that they <unk> they have a chance they can start learning to predict a little bit and i know real little ones don't do very much predicting but they should have a chance to say i guess okay i'm gonna get there and this is gonna happen and this is going to happen and if i do this [laughter] and that's gonna happen you know they should have a way to be able to predict what's gonna happen to them and um if you keep changing the people were there and then they have no nothing to hold onto and it's hard enough on little ones to be away from the parents <unk> ah yeah and then different children to have different different ways of handling it one thing i think that parents really <unk>

really staticky <unk> you know you sound quite clear oh well i suppose that's okay i'll just have to put up with it then okay so how are you doing i'm well i'm all right i'm okay but you know your hours feeling when i was in a month and i just wanted to like quit the program and and yeah and i'm feeling that way again [laughter] oh no yeah if you do you go through a like a three monthly cycle or something i i think that that something like that is true <unk> <unk> what <unk> what time of the year that i mean <unk> it's it's high summer yeah well when i was in when i was feeling really bad and um and it was like like marchers right yeah that'd be very i don't know maybe maybe you should check out your check out your biorhythms uh okay [laughter] [noise] how are you our thing going oh joe so if i don't know if i like what i'm doing but i am so isolated and this is this is like the best present i've had the whole year i've been here you're kidding because i don't have anyone to talk to oh come on you're kidding <unk> know i'm not kidding it is so hard to talk to people here <unk> you mean like <unk> like scottish folks well <unk> the the british in general i find them very sort of really reserved and they you know how americans just kind of jump in and oh high <unk> before <unk> kind of thing you know we're stuck in a in a horrible situation together so let's laugh [laughter] and and the british don't jump in right away and i mean once they make friends with you then they're nice to you but i don't know what the secret is of cracking the code you know having <unk> anybody yet [noise] well i mean partly is partly i'm so busy oh god this course joseph was so overwhelming this yeah [laughter] i mean we were in class about six hours a day and then you had to go home and do about twenty five hours worth of homework <unk> to get ready for the next day [laughter] just a birthday <unk> lake worth <unk> middlebury oh oh worse it was like it was like as bad as middlebury edits most intend but it it lasted all year wasn't over in nine weeks [laughter] god [laughter] i know i'm i have so much gray hair [laughter] i mean [laughter] i must have ten times more gray hair than <unk> little ladies it's incredible it's just incredible and then we had our exams in june and so that part's all over with and now i'm just doing dissertation stuff but it's fun now but <unk> working on your own and <unk> yeah well i like i there's there's not so much daily pressure you know where you have to produce for every day huh so it's it's a lot better and um and edinburgh was so beautiful and right now there's all these festival things going on and do you have time to go in and see them and enjoy them while i'm making time i'm i'm <unk> i'm doing something <unk> once a week for sure huh yeah so but the other day i took a bus trip up to the hot into the highlands and that was really good <unk> know that must <unk> really great it's beautiful here it's it's really beautiful and the and the weather is good right now this is like a record or something we've had all this sunshine and blue sky and it's been in the eighties and nobody can believe it so i guess i'm like in the winter [laughter] it was like being in the middle of a hurricane no i mean the wind blows you know i'm not that small i wouldn't say i'm a tiny woman uh-huh and the wind blows me into the head you know i mean it's like <unk> comes off the north sea and knocks you on your chops are you right in the water a really close oh yeah can you swim yeah no it's too cold really really cold you'd be nuts if you went in for nobody swims no there is a beach actually down the coast to the beach you can get two from here but i haven't been there yet <unk> and sort of people like sunbathe and yeah but then when the water [noise] no they do you can go in down there it's a little bit on it a little bit <unk> south from here uh-huh and on the east coast and you can get there easily from here by bus <unk> and people go there but i haven't been there yet <unk> so you're going to get into going to get to stay there a while after you're done with your program to like sightsee and stuff [noise] well um i i guess i'm just going to do mostly like one or two days thing you know <unk> and because it's so small and you can go all over on the bus huh and um there's a student travel agency on campus and i don't get <unk> student discount on things you know so i can go i can go away for a weekend and it's not too expensive you sit like hostels and stuff [noise] well no i mean actually you know being bees or whatever really not not too bad yeah so are there other non non brits <unk> the program there aren't any brits in the program there are six of us in my class yeah myself and an italian woman old she must be great fun she's great great she <unk> um started that she's what she's from virginia oh and um and then the four guys are all arabs sudanese and i'm moroccan uh-huh and oh and the moroccan guy knows <unk> by the way the world yeah and um [noise] and two libyan guys really and that's it in my in my year in my class it was very <unk> able to get close to them <unk> yeah they got the guys are all really nice you know but we've had so much work to do that you know we we don't really have much chance to to you know spend a lot of time with each other but um but <unk> <unk> and i have become friends uh-huh so and she's a lot of fun she's very interesting actually i'll bet she um she was she went across the sahara desert by camel she her husband is a writer his name is michael <unk> michael what ascher ascher fish i've never heard of him and they they got when they got married their honeymoon was a nine month trip across the sahara desert they started out and i think they started out in morocco and made their way down and all the all the way to um through the sudan oh my god yeah oh yeah i think she was first on the first european woman to do that oh my god that must have <unk> hellish yeah they <unk> he he wrote a book about it <unk> so you see american now he's he's english uh-huh interesting <unk> her arabic must be really good it's pretty <unk> it's not any better than mine well your arabic is really good it's it's <unk> it's gotten pretty good actually i've learned some interesting stuff here this year are you doing simultaneous stuff no we're not doing any simultaneous why not not at all because um [noise] yeah i think you have you have to for one thing you have to be a lot better at arabic than i am to do it but i'm mostly we're we spend most of our time on translation <unk> and <unk> only have very little bit on interpreting and the interpreting we do is is a consecutive liaison interpreting what does that mean it means that um you you actually <unk> well you you do it by paragraph <unk> small small sort of small bits of speech and in some ways it's harder than simultaneous um because you have to not only remember what was said <unk> you have to get all the facts right now remember at all yeah all the dates and amount and you know so there's um there's a lot of practice in note taking and devising your own sort of set of symbols that will jog your memory you know because you can't you can't keep notes on a whole paragraph of what somebody says you rent you just can't do it so you have to um you have to say for a paragraph you have to be able to put down a one or two symbols and then make a note of any sort of date or amount right and that's it and when you look at that it should it should jog your memory and sort of reconstruct the whole taxed in your head for you interesting and so we practice we practice during that but most most of the time it's translation and i love it [laughter] when i was just gonna ask <unk> aside from from being really busy though it sounds like it's a really good program and you're learning a lot well it's it's an okay program i think they're horribly under funded <unk> and in some ways they had a lot of nerve advertising themselves as a translation programs for non native speakers of arabic but <unk> <unk> what makes you say that because they don't have supporting materials for somebody like me you know i mean the arabs to dictionaries and stuff like that yeah well like the guys who come here the whole country as a supporting resource you know they can turn on the television in here english and learn and learn and learn uh-huh and with translation you'd have to keep learning right and um there is nothing here nothing <unk> nothing they don't have a copy of rights glamour in the library i was so blown away when they don't <unk> they don't have a news paper they don't have they don't have <unk> they don't have any magazines and they you know nothing <unk> them all that crap that you know when i was in jordan both <unk> both both springtime i made everybody collect all the junk they got out of the things they bought you know every time i remember every time somebody went to safeway and they got something that had you know <unk> product advertisement on er imam give it to me and i've collected all that crap and do you know that it isn't that <unk> that kind of stuff but that they need to have in the library <unk> <unk> exactly the kind of stuff all that's all samples of types of you know <unk> types and and <unk> course that would be great to analyze and they don't have any of that who is this what you're doing your your masters thing on no actually i'm doing a mind on some title and hitting know from arabic english from arabic english yes <unk> films you have that you're working with i'm only working on one which is and it's it's so cool there was a documentary here recently <unk> on um did i tell you this already on on on <unk> female bodyguards <unk> oh my god have you ever heard of them no no joseph i never had either this was so interesting he set up a military academy from girls yeah of course it's the only one in the arab world and they they get a like a college education through it and then they have military training and they become his bodyguard what does he have any met as well or just <unk> apparently he does i think in some ways i think it's for show and in other ways i think it might be his own you know sort of entourage she yeah whatever [laughter] exciting but anyway the the one of the channels here did a documentary and what i'm looking at is the um is that some of the pragmatic aspects of of of translating for subtitles thing but also where <unk> come van oh which is the all the people making the thing right right <unk> because there's so much left out of the translation horse sure some things added to the translation <unk> but then but then but then the whole thing was than constructed too of course make you laugh at catastrophe and think that the ads are make you think that the arabs or not you know right right and um so what i'm doing is i'm going to look at some of the ways that that done huh which i find interesting i think that was really interesting yeah i i'm finding it very interesting bought <unk> that you could something that it's like that you know i mean that yeah keeps you going and yeah when it comes <unk> do it every day yeah so anyway so tell me why you want to quit out <unk> [laughter] [noise] well it's not not that i want to quit arabic and just tired of doing what i'm doing i don't feel like it's it's <unk> interesting and [noise] i don't know i want to be doing something productive and i don't feel like this is you know why not why don't you know like it is you mean because well you know i mean i'm at the point where i have to be self directed so and i do so much better when somebody says here go read these things and assimilate them and respond to them and you know that kind of thing and so yeah no my linguistics <unk> and i i you know for for months all i did was read these articles and find connections and that was great you know uh-huh but now that that's over i'm doing this research project where i have to um recording people and doing cruise took analyses and it just seems so um the phonetic stuff is so far removed from anything language <unk> yeah so nothing nothing cultural really know and that's <unk> that's okay i think at this point because the the arab cultural stuff for me you know as a gay person it's it's like [noise] sometimes you just don't want to deal with that that stuff yeah and that's the only cultural things that i'm dealing with no or things like well how do i find the sixteen people that i want to do recordings for an how do i i'm one of the best ways to get them to be saying in the lab but i want them to say the right register and that sort of thing yeah but i think i i'm i'm really willing to to just teach and it just seems so far removed from it you know you can <unk> you could if you were in britain you could teach <unk> while you're doing that you know there are so many people in university here only <unk> only have masters degrees well you know i think that there's a big problem in the way that we our education system work where you have to get a p._h._d. to teach at a university and and i think that a p._h._d. isn't <unk> doesn't really mean that you're a good teacher <unk> infected <unk> training it'd be a good teacher but it says that you can do research yeah really interested in doing research i'm interested in teaching but in order to teach i've got to be at this i've got to do this research thing <unk> i am actually teaching i'm teaching egyptian political arabic in the fall oh that'd be fun i'm really looking forward to it really really looking forward to it um [noise] i wish i were taking it [laughter] you'd be my started <unk> i'd love it it would be really fun <unk> hopefully it's gonna it's gonna go well actually last semester i taught introduction arabic linguistics and i had twelve students six of them were grad students <unk> undergrad and was so hard charlene because i had all these different levels in the class and different people want to different things from it and it was really amazing i i was teaching three hours at a time once a week holy cow yeah so it was it wasn't <unk> enjoyable teaching it was really stressful teaching that that would be really hard to come up with three out yo wow what ended up doing that she was over compensating so i i usually had like five hours worth of stuff that i tried to a gym into three hours yeah boy i would be really interested in the in that course it was well i can tell you the syllabus if you like yes please do you know you know who's coming to to michigan in the fall who do you know <unk> <unk> well i'm i know his name i i never met him he was at um the ohio state university mhm and he is george <unk> dealings arabic you know i do you know the <unk> it's a good word you shouldn't notice and some say for example i have a brother uh-huh no so you have a sister okay and i'm mary you and then this other guy marries your sister uh-huh right then the relationship between me and that guy is ideas and the significance of it is that you <unk> it links three unrelated families together oh is that makes sense yeah so professor carris my adviser uh-huh is the idea of fred <unk> oh okay so since professional <unk> retired um and we want to keep up the linguistics stuff at u. of m. <unk> he's going to teach one class each of the two semesters and where currently in the process of looking for a new era this <unk> who are they going <unk> have they decided on anybody to invite to interview yet <unk> i was on the committee we started last year and i'm a graduate student <unk> <unk> and it was really interesting surely not <unk> i i still it was amazing to see this process um we invited three people and none of them actually one of them that apartment really liked but the students were really i'm very much against her her name was um bernstein bernstein over you know what i probably shouldn't be saying well we're being recorded [laughter] probably not you can you can email me the name later [laughter] right well <unk> i think i think that that name is not well in in any case um so what happened was that there was there was this this the committee i think i better not talks yeah <unk> <unk> what ends up happening is that we're <unk> we're extending the search on <unk> and so hopefully i'll still be on it and and <unk> what i'm doing <unk> watching the process you know yeah it is so amazing to see all these people with their their records and and i'm looking through resumes and feet <unk> unbelievable to see the people that are doing this stuff and what the competition is you know it makes me think though that i'll never ever get a job because they just lay skipped over some people that i think really really amazing people wow i don't know i can't figure it out well so they're looking for somebody to do arabic linguistics well that's partially it the department is is anxious to have somebody who can do all kinds of things and so they really want cultural stuff and they they use so see what <unk> what does that mean cultural stuff will see that's <unk> that's the problem i think that they don't really know what they mean by that what they want someone who could teach something about arab culture i mean do they want somebody who can who can when they're teaching an arabic class tell you you know don't show the bottom of your shoes or something [laughter] [laughter] hey what did they mean by cultural well i think i i think that that's that's a big problem if they haven't really dealt with and and it's causing great difficulties in this surge yeah but um but it's an interesting process to watch i bet i bet it is and you <unk> everybody that we know all the middle <unk> people and the mesa people all these people are applying for this position it's so amazing so yeah wow [noise] well um is <unk> our peep when when you say a big linguistics mhm what <unk> mean our our people in the states who do and boy <unk> let me make this a decent sentence the people in the states who do out there <unk> uh-huh do they work in arabic discourse analysis that all <unk> actually i i think that i may have mentioned do it at one point to the message that that's that's becoming this big thing all of a sudden oh last arabic linguistics society meeting was had a special um focus on on discourse and my mood is really into that apparently yeah well i <unk> he's got an article that that is quite interesting <unk> me but um [noise] huh because because the guy i'm working with <unk> i mean that he just lives and breathes that really you know i mean that's that's it you know everything else is crap to him and <unk> and you know this is like it'd be all and end all you can't you can't you can't do anything without oriented your brain this way [laughter] so and do you like that yeah i do like it was always yeah i can't stand that stuff [noise] it's um i don't know it there's so many <unk> the results of it impressed me you know <unk> as far as translation is concerned i don't i don't know about where it gets you if you're just dealing with <unk> <unk> if you're not if you're not a translator and your and your goal is not translation huh i'm not sure how interesting that this would be the guy that you're working with his interested in it from a translation perspective yes uh-huh mm yeah that that seems to make a lot more sense to me actually i find that a lot more appealing than people who do theoretical sorts of discourse analysis which i find just way too much <unk> you know i can't like at least the phonetics you know i can i can stick some <unk> through a machine and i can get <unk> readings frequency values an apple attitudes and yeah and so it's something much more tangible you know <unk> and phonology and even syntax it's it's much more structured but with people who do discourse stuff i find um i just can't i don't know it's too messy for me there's nothing to sing clay teeth into you know [noise] well the thing that bothered me about all of the theory that we've done so far is that most of it deals still <unk> on the level of the <unk> <unk> <unk> and on and of course in our translation course we don't we don't do that at all i mean that you know you get an electric shock after you get stuck on the <unk> the level of dissent and yeah we we have to deal always with the tax and beyond the tax in order to produce a decent translation interesting and so <unk> this <unk> the discourse analysis theory that i read about in books is you know i mean i look at it and i think who cares what this this yet you right now right and and what what there is one little there is in the journal is somewhat interesting you know the stuff that that deals with larger unit then <unk> <unk> but there's not very much <unk> arabic at all i mean it's like a totally open field [laughter] [noise] and then you say that was such a relish well i mean it drives me nuts i wish i wish it were all laid out you know and somebody could tell me what it is i want to know but there isn't anybody to give answers to the questions i have and i so i don't really think of myself as a scholar particularly you know i mean i would rather just be out there as a translator and working as a translator and and when i had a question i would love to be able to ask it and have somebody said ahah yes blah blah blah blah blah and instead i find that the questions i've been wrestling with ever since i started studying arabic are finally becoming on acknowledged as worthwhile question <unk> and but they're still no answer so does it make you wanted to look for the answer to them yes it does but it's very frustrating because i want the answers now [laughter] well you know actually i think that that's part of what frustrates with what i'm so frustrated with this it's such a slow process you know where i've been thinking about my dissertation research now for like three years and i pretty much know what i want to do but you don't want <unk> each <unk> so laborious and i just wanted to be there i want the answers i want to know and i want to sort of carry on and go into the classroom and teach and [noise] yeah exactly i know exactly what you're saying so are you thinking about doing a p._h._d. well i am but um you know i if i stick with bond i want to stick with translation uh-huh and so the best place for me to stick to do that here and <unk> is there a p._h._d. program and <unk> yes uh-huh yeah and you need to get funding to do it i know and i don't i don't know what i'm going to do on so i really don't you know is there anybody there that can sort of advise you on all the people here don't no shit about [laughter] pardon my friend [laughter] they they they really you know this is not the information society anyway the united states is the information society joseph they had a christmas party here for the foreign students made up signs everywhere know christmas party everybody invited such and such a day on all foreign students <unk> sure income and they did not put the time on the notice

i'll pretty much like universities would have a b. u. at the end yeah i think mine doesn't have one does she know i don't think so mhm i'm laurie i'm trying to figure out my plans i still have no idea what i'm doing when i get to israel and nothing has worked out but i'm still come <unk> eating non [laughter] but i'm still coming did you ever um get in touch with the i'd given you know the other <unk> number of the girl in uh in the middle <unk> <unk> um yeah well i i i did fax them a letter was a little bit after that date like maybe a week later yeah i fax him a letter and i never heard from them and i had and they <unk> which kind of said is you know come and we'll talk sort of thing uh-huh yeah so basically the one okay <unk> well interns for peace retracted their offer because they just said i wasn't enthusiastic enough who's this <unk> interns for peace <unk> like they had offered me a place and then they took it back but didn't you also so you you're still weren't that keen all night i wasn't but i still would have rather rejected them than have them reject me yeah and then um [noise] and then the next place which i was so hopeful about was was um more done the sun <unk> high <unk> when you're young women's leadership program and the woman made it sound <unk> promising and i waited two months <unk> hear back and then i haven't heard from her and it was after the date so i called <unk> and she said <unk> was going to affect you this evening i'm you know we're not really fair what's happening the position maybe being redefined and then a week later she called me and left a message saying <unk> you know they had all these things on the burner and i said really look someplace else because they don't know what's going on and <unk> and so i had really stopped looking for things 'cause he made it sound <unk> promising and like it was going to be almost full time <unk> and then <unk> and then <unk> you know so instead of now it's like you know maybe a ten hour week position and requires fluent hebrew and it's just totally different than what we had talked about <unk> and so then meanwhile you might have even had offered me a a very short term parts yeah you mentioned by writing something <unk> yeah like helping with grant writing and miscellaneous things and living on a nearby keep <unk> maybe is it money you can even living uh davidson savia's and get to give up <unk> yeah but it might be nice to be on the ballot 'cause then i would get to know some people but anyway so then but that was three months ago that they offered me that you know who knows if they found some <unk> them about a week and a half ago and i hadn't her back from them and so i i called the new york office and she said she'd get back to me probably you know yesterday or today as soon as she could talk with them mhm because maybe they found someone i don't know yeah so that's i'm i'm really hoping that would work out you know it's something you know that if not i mean i'm just coming anyway but i have no idea like we're all go what are you planning coming sometime either like mid to late september or early october <unk> <unk> um [noise] 'cause i'm thinking that i'd like to stop in europe on the way and visit some friends i have a friend in spain and a friend in france and germany oh that can be fun so i'd like to see them on the way and especially if i have nothing lined up there's no reason i can't why novel weeks in the part of europe in my free now you <unk> when you can read unemployed [laughter] [laughter] yeah well that sounds fun though so i mean i'll becoming sometime you know in the fall but i don't know he's actually went and oh i talked to 'em just said <unk> uh-huh and i told them <unk> <unk> he was really excited 'cause he said 'cause i haven't seen her <unk> ages and i said well she was here last <unk> yeah and <unk> he was gone and but he was he's going to be studying i think in the hype area but you know uh-huh still be around his family's here oh but anyway he was extremely excited here's your coming oh good yeah that's nice yeah and then <unk> time uh-huh um see <unk> and then <unk> what kind of how long have you <unk> you basically once you're leaving uh michigan you'll be you'll be at home now yeah then i'll be with mom until i leave okay because i tentatively what i've got is i'm i'm i tend to be booked a flight i'm the sixth uh-huh from south carolina to new york okay i don't know <unk> too long for me to be staying at all it's not at all to line no no i mean once your mother was that one <unk> the game that <unk> i'm the only one beside the michigan let's stay in the house the rest are going to be no place else i don't know actually you know what i was trying to convince them that mama bob need to go to a hotel and then our house can be the hotel for everybody else it'll be a fun place that's true too but then mom she said they're going to go to the hotel anyway for the night after she said oh no no we're going to stay like mom that that won't be any fun but i think i think like abby you will be probably with us and maybe john and i think there'll be a bunch of people with <unk> <unk> you know any of my relatives that can't afford it or or just find that have around 'cause i know abby was trying to sort of hitch a ride with johnny down yeah and neither johnny <unk> really <unk> <unk> i wonder if some time to be together yeah and it's just kinda was <unk> any longer than <unk> forget <unk> and the baby then there's definitely no minute on the baby yeah i'm into <unk> yeah but then there's definitely no ones take them in any case that's too bad though i mean i can see <unk> i i would love to do it with you but i mean i don't know i i i can see johnny also <unk> i haven't seen him it'd be it'd be just the two of us the you know <unk> driving down <unk> see you and the dog what the two of you and <unk> yeah that's fine <unk> him also [laughter] you know he's got a pair evil eye grammar <unk> said he was going to he's got the water i already got their baby pictures oh my gosh [laughter] photograph the kids are rough who's going to take care of him when he's gone i think it's going to go oh my goodness going crazy [laughter] i've gotta see that house yeah it's really pretty he lives in such a pretty area oh i <unk> i mean i don't know maybe i should stay here a little longer i thought i would go down early to help mom get ready for the wedding yeah it'd be a lot more fun like to hang out here a little i mean not a lot more fun but it'd be nice to hang out here a little bit after i'm done working real attack and then <unk> the u._n. johnny together when did you finished working <unk> the twenty fifth mhm and then i need to pack up and then drive home and it's gonna take me two days for sure because i can't drive more than seven hours a day yeah my myself well actually if you were to go down later than <unk> than <unk> know but you would never <unk> either you've got all your stuff you're taking down yeah and <unk> <unk> i mean i just finished his <unk> <unk> i think <unk> she's going to have the new year round trip thing anyway she's going to have to get back <unk> so it's probably cheaper to get around <unk> something <unk> than hitch a ride and then try to get a one-way ticket back yeah i mean i wouldn't mind having abby in the car but i just have so much stuff yeah and then he's not just avi's abby the baby and you know i don't even think i would be able to get all my stuff back even even um with just me i think i'm going <unk> and stuff <unk> johnny for him to take down whenever he goes to south carolina and that could be you know when there's more remembered his car yeah [laughter] but um but i don't know somebody will be able to do something <unk> you know even so but you see you'll be there then when <unk> yeah the week after the wedding i'll be oh that'll be good then maybe i'll even <unk> change just life into the seventh <unk> <unk> yeah i mean i was sort of you know <unk> i didn't wanna over stay my well <unk> i'm sure that i'll still be there and i just can't imagine that mom would be you know you can always stay in my room you know like you could stay with me and we'll have fun when mom's at work yeah because i was thinking that if she would have been okay i don't want to hang around too much but if you're going to be bearing avail yeah fun yeah i mean i'll probably need to like be running around a little bit to get ready for my trip but no that's no big deal <unk> okay don't run around do shopping whatever's yeah and mom and bomb have two cards for my car we'll be back so i'm have a car and um it's very strange that i've never met bob [laughter] oh yeah that's right he's he's a good guy he really is he looks very nice and the pictures and i'm everyone that's met him so he is so strange you know well i don't you don't know hugo that much but he reminds us of hugo some like he's sort of got this european sensibility about him mhm um and he's really generous like he's he's just been so nice to our family like the whole time that for <unk> sake he would come in the for the in the hospital like every week that i remember your mom saying that he really just was one of the few people that really stuck by until the very end wasn't scared off by right bio stages of disease and then he was there for mom you know after <unk> died and <unk> was you know he used to take me an dmitri out to eat if mom and dad were away he would just like take us out to a restaurant oh wow it's just been buddies for years yeah we've known them for years and i mean at first i was really kind of uncomfortable like i liked him very much as a friend of a family but yeah like him so much as part of the family yeah but i'm reading now and the the hard thing to get used to and as long as you know they're happy it's fine i mean it doesn't affect you guys are a little kids <unk> you're right i mean he's just he's not going to be my dad and he's never going to be as charming is already but you know if if your mom or unhappy then that's good yeah your mom's got a lot of a lotta years ahead of her yeah so so i have <unk> boy they're just going crazy with all the wedding preparations like i'm like <unk> wedding central <unk> the table and the dining room with all their wedding files [laughter] book and their mom was telling me like a week ago <unk> they spent two hours on the wedding database like she has a computer program [laughter] with like i don't know the the phone numbers of everybody in the addresses of everyone and they said invitations too and so you know <unk> you just spend almost all of their time not at work like about the wedding <unk> um [noise] i still don't know what to get them as a nice wedding <unk> having the for a while i was thinking of having a some sort of a a stained glass o'clock or something made for them uh-huh but by the time i got around to really thinking about uh seriously that wasn't time yeah you know what <unk> i'm trying to they're just gorgeous gorgeous pizza pottery that <unk> a local artist in ann arbor made and she actually sold that peace but she could she would make another one for us mhm beautiful wedding peace it's like a big huge while platter like uh it's maybe eighteen inches across likes her come friends and uh a plate with three dimensional figures on it and it's just beautifully colored and made and i want to get it for mom her present but i can't afford it by myself well how much is it about five hundred dollars and then i'm trying to get to meet for you to go in on it with me but he he i think he's sort of planning another present for maybe like he'll put in a little bit <unk> i could go and i was thinking <unk> about a hundred <unk> okay maybe maybe we could like do that together somehow but i would want to know pretty soon <unk> i've <unk> i've been looking for stuff here okay well i'm <unk> practical i mean is it is it five hundred dollars nice it's beautiful i mean i might be able to bark and her down a little bit but it was supposed to be five hundred and fifty <unk> it'll be late also could fiesta make one <unk> one piece old uh-huh but it's i mean i think it's so beautiful and i really wanted to give them something nice and i took some pictures so i can i've sent some dimitri to see if he was interested but i can also than once a mom <unk> the this you like it i mean if they if they really like it then we should do it but if they aren't into it then it wouldn't be worth it yeah yeah but um well we could um we can email architect dimitri email you ah located <unk> you know trying to or you've also got my stocks and the factory don't you <unk> i think so i mean like six nine for eight seven seven seven yeah yeah yeah i could <unk> try <unk> i mean as soon as because i'm i'm in fact i'm probably <unk> sunday i'm actually going to be in tel aviv i've got to go to see a drug test their doctor something but then uh i was thinking <unk> i've been to some shopping some final you know president shopping <unk> that was one of those going to try and look for okay well i'm in addition i i actually got also they have the you know the music festival thing here so i got bobby <unk> a tee shirt and a half a with <unk> got <unk> the teachers just gotten the strike chamber music festival thing on it uh-huh that's nice <unk> [laughter] that's good i'm ah are you okay laurie um i i don't know what i've been having headaches dizziness and i paying for like a month and a half oh no and they don't know what it's from and i went to i mean i went to the eye doctor and to the gynecologist and i've had an e._e._g. and i'm having a cat scan of the brain done next week it's i'm guessing it's probably gonna be as i say just in my head like <unk> maybe i don't know uh-huh but when it hits me it's i mean i've <unk> quite a few times had just to have to go home and just go to bed i could stick to the dizziness <unk> everything is spinning and i can't focus is it like a migraine you think it could be but it's not <unk> i don't really know if that's what the the doctor thought maybe and if it's migrant she said it could be gone <unk> because it seems as if the <unk> like it came the first time came two months ago kevin period exactly mhm and then last for about two and a half three weeks and then went away for about a week week and a half and i won't say it was every day of the two and half weeks but you know on an off quite a bit over that period and then it came back again exactly when i got my period again mhm and what really scared me that is that i really the next time exactly the day land of the states oh and i knew that like a home that yeah so i actually went also pill for this like for two months i don't know if that's you know we'll make a difference or not and uh they gave me some sort of a free menopausal migraine something medication i don't see it's really helping much it may be a bit but the anyway we're testing checking everything <unk> yeah it's a real pain <unk> scary <unk> <unk> yeah <unk> i won't say i'm really worried about it being anything horrible mhm but just i when i got this dizziness i just don't i'm not in control myself and the thing is it now it's getting worse because like i've <unk> i've missed a couple of days of work because i've been feeling crummy yeah and then i've got a lot of work piling up and um racing against the clock to get things done before i leave right and then i get probably more nervous and that makes it even worse than you know it's just oh no no [laughter] no you know but uh hopefully it'll be okay i haven't <unk> don't think i'm i haven't seen anything <unk> <unk> my mother <unk> there was no reason can i tell my mom can mention it i mean you don't <unk> i don't care you can't you can't do this <unk> not to mention <unk> you don't <unk> don't know what it is yet <unk> hopefully it'll turn off the nothing because i already had a psychological something this past year i had one of my shoulders horrible shoulder pain i couldn't pick my left arm up more than i could do exactly horizontal couldn't go any higher than horizontal uh-huh and this last for two and a half months uh-huh and went to urine idols of you know <unk> and his shoulder understand the other thing and then just one way and i think in the end it was just <unk> wow but or whatever [laughter] oh um how's how's everybody else in the family doing <unk> <unk> you know her birthday with two days ago oh in fact she just had her girlfriends birthday party they can't believe that she's nine and she's going into fourth grade [laughter] wow [laughter] the only thing that i could send her little presents know we'll see maybe we can pick up something together they'll bring it back even okay maybe have ruin your suitcases to bring back more stuff for me was when i moved israel i'm not going <unk> eddie rumors that [laughter] [laughter] okay i'm i'm going to say i guess that <unk> was doing okay but but the whole thing is sort of unfortunate i don't think they're going to be able to rerunning off to the states <unk> by themselves anymore yeah that's what david pretty much the that the they're they're not that young <unk> <unk> you know <unk> either that or someone has to go with them to be around to give them <unk> yeah but <unk> was <unk> when did you talk to a <unk> when did you like when i saw them when they were here and then i got a little <unk> letter from <unk> because i had sent them some photograph mhm and then but that was before he got sick and then i talk to mom who talk grandma ruth who says he's moved to a rehabilitation place you're kidding <unk> talked

4520-000000-000931 well i used to be a teacher mhm and i think there are many things wrong with the public school system and that <unk> got out of teaching <unk> uh what they were the problems that he found in a public school systems well [noise] um i think the main problem is there's just not enough discipline and the classes are too big because um kids to get away with too much and there's not really that much that a teacher can do because um the ministry <unk> worried about the big problems about um you know kids bringing guns to school yeah and they don't have time to worry about the the problem of of maintenance meant that they used to be able to worry about <unk> i think the problem is that is if you start considering yourself more with discipline i think um i think teachers main goal should be more worried about this one was getting <unk> students or you know kids interested in learning because as i can recall where i went to go to school um most of the teachers were just basically bent on either try discipline you force you to go through this material show no really interest i mean into making it interesting or fun fun and <unk> school were two oxymoron type of words and i think that was basically the problem because there were two more inches they built up this type of um [noise] i don't know <unk> this might not be in your case but at least where i went to school i'm a superiority complex where they had to be always more intelligent than their students and is it possible for students they felt more intimidated when uh people would ask you questions that they didn't understand themselves and rather than doing those third either you know ridiculed student or tell them to shut up or you know this <unk> recovering we're doing this <unk> kids would be interested in foreign different arab venues were just basically <unk> because you know <unk> you know they're all more concerned that everybody falls <unk> certain path although i agree that discipline is uh important um especially since there are in in different areas were kids already grown to a point of rebellion were guns those you mentioned but uh in general or certain areas i think if if if they start earlier maybe not in just the high school level but i mean the elementary school maybe you have to worry about <unk> um that the students would you know if the teacher's got kids interested in more into learning rather than <unk> <unk> eliminate these pseudo rebel rules that are created because you know if the teachers that don't do this and then kids do it especially that age they want to be a rebel so there are different they prove themselves by you know i'm going against establishment type of thing or what do you think well i think the problem with that the problem i had because when i went into teaching <unk> you know the <unk> creative director and i'm like <unk> saint that learning was fun <unk> teach an eighth grade or guns or that level too yeah [laughter] [noise] okay <unk> <unk> north carolina well this isn't south carolina okay but anyway the problem that i had was um my students didn't really know how to respond to that <unk> and they basically didn't they didn't appreciate everything i was trying to do for him because i would have learning games all the time and i tried to do just bond thing and make it interesting and did creative thinking and just all kinds of things and they just took advantage of me and i walked all over me and i was never <unk> able to establish any kind of discipline because i started out being <unk> nice really do you think the problem <unk> originated at an earlier stage that maybe kids were really thought much to respect you know teachers and also try see that's the thing is i don't think that they do respect teachers and i'm saying that that that will just a minister i shouldn't <unk> school didn't give me any support and it's like after you know the students were already taken advantage of me <unk> um they just told me don't just crack <unk> and then they went and support me in that and they just told me that the only way that the students would respond would be if i had a completely stretching environment and all this miserable doing that
