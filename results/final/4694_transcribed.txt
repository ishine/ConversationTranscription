00:00:00	00:00:01	2	okay <unk> elderly 
00:00:01	00:00:03	1	right um 
00:00:03	00:00:06	2	haven't had any personal experience with that luckily 
00:00:06	00:00:08	1	yeah but uh 
00:00:08	00:00:20	2	i'm only twenty seven and my parents are in their mid to late fifties and and i've already you know discussed it tried to discuss it with them and they kind of <unk> me and told me to shut 
00:00:20	00:00:21	1	you know [laughter] 
00:00:21	00:00:34	2	but um i've got a a girlfriend who's grandfather has already made all kinds of arrangements if he needs some sort of long term care he'll be able to get it and has shifted all his assets and things 'cause if you have any assets 
00:00:34	00:00:35	1	mhm 
00:00:35	00:00:46	2	sometimes you can't get you know the kind of um financial help from the government that one would hope you would get right yes they do you have any personal experience with it no i sure don't 
00:00:46	00:00:53	1	um i really never did get a chance to know my grandparents because they all died when australia 
00:00:53	00:01:01	2	mhm yeah my mother she pass and my father he's living but he's uh seventies 
00:01:01	00:01:02	1	five oh uh-huh 
00:01:02	00:01:10	2	but he's uh so for they would take case f. he's remarried and and uh he's doing real well 
00:01:10	00:01:12	1	well that's good that's a blessing 
00:01:12	00:01:24	2	but uh just just knowing him he wouldn't go for anything like that no way really no well it's nice that he has family around yeah so then maybe that's not the only option 
00:01:24	00:01:25	1	right 
00:01:25	00:01:27	2	for so many people it it's the only option and 
00:01:27	00:01:28	1	well that's true 
00:01:28	00:01:35	2	i know here in raleigh recently in white county around raleigh um there was one nursing home that was going to be close 
00:01:35	00:01:36	1	mhm 
00:01:36	00:01:42	2	because of neglect of of patience and and there were some questionable deaths at the home 
00:01:45	00:01:57	2	it does because if you just think if you own film or you don't want to be bothered with you worry about someone else 'course they getting paid and of course and then they're not taking good care of you 
00:01:57	00:02:00	1	they know taking good care of yeah exactly 
00:02:00	00:02:08	2	that's kind of scary and i uh i don't know i would certainly interview these places 
00:02:09	00:02:17	2	you know and ask them lots and lots of questions and um you know one thing they say about when you're choosing a daycare for your child is that you should dropping unannounced 
00:02:18	00:02:23	2	want to do that too you know make sure they don't have any <unk> fan just because it's visiting time or what 
00:02:23	00:02:23	1	right 
00:02:23	00:02:36	2	i think that would be one of the best things you could do and and i don't know one thing with me as i just try to rely on my gut reaction mhm you know if if something's bothering me if i don't feel good about something then probably there's a good reason 
00:02:36	00:02:37	1	right yeah 
00:02:37	00:02:49	2	that's a good idea though to do that yeah i i think i would do the same thing and i'm sure there's a lot of cases where it'd been mistreated <unk> whatever 
00:02:49	00:02:50	1	yeah 
00:02:50	00:02:55	2	i guess people just get tired of people but we all going to get over one day if we keep 
00:02:55	00:02:56	1	that's right 
00:02:56	00:03:01	2	and hopefully there'll be somebody to take care of us you know where we won't have to go into a home but 
00:03:01	00:03:07	1	<unk> my dad says that <unk> there's five of us kids and he says he's going to spend two months of the year with each of us 
00:03:07	00:03:15	2	and whoever treated them the worst he's gonna spend the other two months of the year with them and they'll have it for four months of the uh 
00:03:15	00:03:15	1	so but 
00:03:15	00:03:19	2	thanks that [laughter] um 
00:03:19	00:03:20	1	uh i don't know 
00:03:20	00:03:24	2	what would happen if if my parents needed to go live with somebody 
00:03:28	00:03:28	2	yeah 
00:03:28	00:03:32	1	cause nowadays uh people are taking better care of themselves 
00:03:32	00:03:34	2	uh-huh 
00:03:34	00:03:35	1	but to manage on their own 
00:03:35	00:03:40	2	yeah you know which is is a plus because me off
