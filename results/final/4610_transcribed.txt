00:18:04	00:18:07	2	do that i don't want to do that 'cause i 
00:18:12	00:18:13	2	you'll be exhausted 
00:18:13	00:18:15	1	yeah and i won't want to do it i won't be able to <unk> 
00:18:15	00:18:17	2	right where we can do you think 
00:18:17	00:18:18	1	spending together time 
00:18:18	00:18:21	2	together and moving moving in 
00:18:21	00:18:22	1	is fine yeah 
00:18:22	00:18:37	2	alright well um [noise] like i guess we'll have to figure out our respective movements when when it gets closer but i'm going to um ashville with greg tomorrow [noise] and um 
00:18:47	00:18:48	2	trip with a friend 
00:19:00	00:19:01	1	mhm 
00:19:01	00:19:03	2	i guess ten days later 
00:19:04	00:19:16	2	i mean he's not staying the whole time but he'll come back the last weekend of the month i think they said and then go back down to new york and he can probably take us then 'cause it's gotten to be i just moving on my own is just very very difficult 
00:19:16	00:19:17	1	stay up there 
00:19:17	00:19:20	2	um well and i'm going to try and get back to work on my paper which is 
00:19:20	00:19:22	1	it's ridiculous but 
00:19:22	00:19:24	2	i'm going to make an effort 
00:19:24	00:19:28	1	well we can both make an effort you know you can all finished my book you finish your paper 
00:19:28	00:19:32	2	yeah although you know kenny classes start really early 
00:19:32	00:19:35	1	uh-huh yeah but then don't you have all those holidays 
00:19:35	00:19:43	2	that's true [laughter] that's a good point i should really use those shouldn't i i haven't learned learned 
00:19:43	00:19:48	1	childcare yet i'm being really flaky about it and i know i'm gonna hate myself later you know 
00:19:48	00:19:49	2	oughta take this semester off 
00:19:49	00:19:50	1	[laughter] 
00:19:50	00:19:53	2	but did i tell you this is the last year if the job it's 
00:19:53	00:19:55	1	is that for sure it's 
00:19:55	00:20:08	2	for sure yet but um but they've sent me a letter saying that the president did not ask for funding for it in his budget and it looks quite doubtful that the senate is going to want to put it back in 
00:20:08	00:20:09	1	uh-huh 
00:20:09	00:20:20	2	um so that <unk> that this is the last year of it so i'm reluctant to take a semester off considering that i would only then have one semester left 
00:20:20	00:20:25	1	well anyway you know this is not good i mean apart from the ten year at the book 
00:20:25	00:20:29	2	you know this is not going to be a killing term from me i'm only teaching one 
00:20:29	00:20:31	1	and i've taught 
00:20:31	00:20:32	2	uh-huh so 
00:20:32	00:20:34	1	no and and i 
00:20:34	00:20:41	2	well once your tenure fell goes in i'll be ready to believe that but until you get it in i don't think you should have i think you should have 
00:20:41	00:20:46	1	you know you should not be cutting corners on putting that file together 
00:20:46	00:20:52	2	that's like critical for us so i don't want you to <unk> i don't want you to take on a a lot of extra 
00:20:52	00:20:54	1	at the beginning 'cause 
00:20:54	00:20:58	2	it doesn't make sense yeah believe me dear once you get ten year i will have no <unk> 
00:20:59	00:21:02	2	[laughter] 
00:21:12	00:21:22	2	but not this not immediately this semester just because you <unk> you know you've you've got a child now you've got to get tenure 
00:21:22	00:21:29	1	that's right [laughter] [noise] now what was the what was your trip in what was the time in new mexico 
00:22:03	00:22:04	1	we had the legend 
00:22:28	00:22:31	1	[noise] and he had the most ridiculous realtor you've ever seen 
00:22:31	00:22:33	2	i mean um 
00:22:33	00:22:35	1	and uh 
00:22:35	00:22:45	2	he hates zoning property and he and he could only buy a house for three hundred and thirty thousand dollars which was about half of what he wanted to spend and um 
00:22:45	00:22:47	1	he was uh 
00:22:47	00:23:04	2	and then joel showed up she i'm always there and bomb was picking on jam electro was does even though gym as a doll joel then turned up the day after i arrived and drove us mad [laughter] robe us crazy he was more of noxious than he's ever been 
00:23:04	00:23:06	1	how do you know you haven't seen a bit of agents 
00:23:06	00:23:08	2	well see i'm a said so 
00:23:08	00:23:10	1	i think i have greater tolerance for 
00:23:10	00:23:17	2	i think you do definitely does i think you do but he really was he really was a pain in the neck and genocide it's because his girlfriend just dumped him 
00:23:17	00:23:19	1	uh-huh 
00:23:19	00:23:36	2	um but anyway so mom elections were freaking out because of that but they have no ability to seventy limits you know so like they can't say to joel look you know go away for a while or i mean she couldn't say <unk> no they can't come that we 
00:23:36	00:23:36	1	uh-huh 
00:23:36	00:23:51	2	that you know and and we were supposed to go to dinner one night and they showed up unexpectedly they were supposed to be out they had gone to the grand canyon and we didn't expect them back and they shut up unexpectedly and you know they monitor lexus couldn't could not bring themselves to say 
00:23:51	00:23:53	1	we're taking clear out to a nice dinner 
00:23:53	00:24:05	2	see you later this is our only evening with her you know we want to have some time with her they couldn't bring myself to say that but they were so upset that he'd come back that they the the evening was just like a <unk> 
00:24:05	00:24:07	1	it was painful 
00:24:18	00:24:19	1	i mean 
00:24:19	00:24:24	2	i mean it was supposed to be a family vacation and it was like it was like so 
00:24:24	00:24:27	1	stressful i mean i don't know why i didn't know why i had bother to go 
00:24:27	00:24:40	2	and then you know eve eve and south we're down in their house and bombs hollow for energies seem to be going towards protecting eve from too many distractions because even had to work 
00:24:40	00:24:41	1	yeah 
00:24:41	00:24:51	2	so you know there was you couldn't go to <unk> house or you couldn't you couldn't ask eve to have joe and gym a for a night although she was perfectly capable of having a guy in jenny for a night 
00:24:51	00:24:53	1	i was yes 
00:24:53	00:24:57	2	and then a guy came and he was kind of a jerk you know he was kind of harsh with me 
00:24:57	00:25:00	1	[noise] um 
00:25:00	00:25:08	2	you know just sort of not very sensitive and didn't want to help with join a gym at all we finally made him take them out for an afternoon 
00:25:08	00:25:11	1	i mean it was all just didn't 
00:25:11	00:25:12	2	you know 
00:25:12	00:25:13	1	it's just ridiculous 
00:25:13	00:25:29	2	and it and it wasn't so great with evil either she she said she wanted to spend a day with me so i set aside just so you know i set aside the day she told me and it what it came down to was my going to her hairdresser with her and sitting there well she talked to her hairdresser for an hour and a half 
00:25:29	00:25:30	1	and then going out 
00:25:30	00:25:32	2	lunch with her 
00:25:32	00:25:34	1	and her baby sitter 
00:25:43	00:25:54	2	told her to go home so we'd have this we'd have this two hour lunch with a babysitter and then we had like half an hour to go into some shops and that was okay 
00:25:54	00:25:54	1	mhm 
00:25:54	00:25:56	2	and it was like 
00:25:56	00:25:56	1	mhm 
00:25:56	00:26:01	2	i mean i was almost like she was protecting herself from spending time with me 
00:26:01	00:26:04	1	but it was really weird 
00:26:04	00:26:06	2	um 
00:26:06	00:26:14	1	they want it to a bar the baby <unk> for their <unk> they're taking em on up there on a camping trip right now with the baby and i got kind of paved and i decided i wasn't going to 
00:26:14	00:26:18	2	when did to them well i just didn't want to 
00:26:18	00:26:21	1	well anyway you use it right 
00:26:21	00:26:25	2	[noise] well i i i haven't used it on long island although i did think i was going to but i mean 
00:26:25	00:26:29	1	what they were going to take it and then mail it back yeah yeah 
00:26:29	00:26:39	2	it was like forget it but i'm in atlanta thing or all funny for exactly i'm going to lend us to mr cheap skate who could buy his own and and then some and refuses to because he's such a 
00:26:39	00:26:46	1	[noise] <unk> and in any way your family it's like the <unk> the guy you know when would you ever

00:27:01	00:27:03	1	for the first time and 
00:27:03	00:27:13	2	in weeks 'cause i you know the parents trip was great but it was definitely kinda stressful i mean i was so nervous about all the traveling then that never really left my mind 
00:27:13	00:27:14	1	mhm 
00:27:14	00:27:20	2	anyway so so much you know i really feel like kind of like my obligation to my family is really 
00:27:20	00:27:22	1	at an and like i 
00:27:22	00:27:29	2	after after that well no but i mean i i will no longer feel that i need to go out of guilt because it's so clearly doesn't
