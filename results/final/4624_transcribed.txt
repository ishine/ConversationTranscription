00:02:22	00:02:24	1	and so people were getting mad at deli lasts 
00:02:24	00:02:28	2	oh that's neat and the poor people are like

00:02:52	00:03:02	1	well i mean i was in germany for one year and then i came back from germany last fall and then i have not been anywhere except for my house in schools since then um like the road in between 
00:03:02	00:03:05	2	good 
00:03:05	00:03:07	1	so how long is the confidence 
00:03:07	00:03:14	2	it's just for one day uh-huh free that's the best thing about in free yeah wow yeah

00:03:16	00:03:23	2	yeah i mean it's it's very interesting mhm mm so you're still going to go it's nice 
00:03:23	00:03:30	1	yeah one too and so i mean i'll be i'll be like paid for everything side too bad if i don't go 
00:03:41	00:03:45	1	i don't think i would take a plane there but i don't know bus or a train or something 
00:03:45	00:03:51	2	oh 'cause i know that i mean if you got here you'd probably ride with robyn 
00:03:51	00:03:53	1	thinking that too but 
00:04:07	00:04:09	1	yeah yeah because 
00:04:09	00:04:27	2	because i don't i mean i think she's okay right now but it would be much better she didn't have to drive by herself yeah i think so too i think that's you know i want to do that but i think she doesn't want me to go through all that trouble yeah i totally it's no big deal i can take the bus on the train and then we could drive them together you know 
00:04:27	00:04:29	1	yeah i mean i think that would be nice 
00:04:29	00:04:36	2	i mean just <unk> and also just 'cause it's nice to go like if you're going to a big place not to go alone because you know how hard it will be to find somebody 
00:04:36	00:04:43	1	right and i'll be alone i don't know anything he's been there before like to the confidence but 
00:04:43	00:04:45	2	i don't know if he isn't it though 
00:04:49	00:04:52	1	about her 'cause like i don't know if you talk to you about her house 
00:04:52	00:04:55	2	yeah she has yeah yeah yeah 
00:04:55	00:05:02	1	there's i mean like uh like last few weeks ago she was like losing control of her hands 
00:05:02	00:05:07	2	and um now she's on some kind of medication that like put it back like she can use their hands 
00:05:07	00:05:09	1	again mhm but she's 
00:05:09	00:05:13	2	like she had to have her hands bandaged up and stuff and like she was having a real hard time at work 
00:05:13	00:05:17	1	so that would make me nervous like if she was going to drive by herself 
00:05:38	00:05:40	1	and i think oh wow 
00:05:40	00:05:53	2	right on an hour that you'd prefer her company or something and then then it won't be like you know she doesn't want to put you out for um you know inconvenient but if you make it sound like you what to do it 
00:05:53	00:05:58	1	she'll probably agree yeah yeah see you're still not thinking of going 
00:06:07	00:06:10	1	but i mean the whole organization 
00:06:10	00:06:21	2	'cause it seems kinda strange like um i don't know it's hard to hard to explain but just real um 
00:06:21	00:06:29	1	want me to dance she said it would be like uh yeah she say you know we should really go to a conference you know as a group because i'd be living with like 
00:06:29	00:06:36	2	four or five sisters this law you went to the place yeah and so she said um 
00:06:36	00:06:42	1	you know it'd be nice if you could go to a conference where they have to be all female 'cause he has uh some of them a meat market 
00:06:42	00:06:44	2	so i mean i i 
00:06:44	00:06:46	1	yeah 
00:06:46	00:06:50	2	and i was like oh i think all that but it's kind of 
00:06:50	00:06:51	1	um people like you know they just 
00:06:51	00:06:58	2	<unk> right [laughter] in one place but uh no no 
00:06:58	00:06:59	1	mhm 
00:07:13	00:07:15	2	yeah um i guess that <unk> 
00:07:15	00:07:16	1	i had heard bad about it was just 
00:07:16	00:07:26	2	there was so into talking about like um the current and stuff but they but they weren't using this as being like a tool for social change it off 
00:07:26	00:07:29	1	but they weren't talking about what we could possibly do 
00:07:31	00:07:33	1	from the world but rather just 
00:07:33	00:07:40	2	well you spend all your time praying kind of philosophy mm and um <unk> that's it 
00:07:40	00:07:41	1	uh-huh uh-huh 
00:07:54	00:07:59	2	yeah yeah i haven't been to either so i can't really talk <unk> but mm 
00:08:13	00:08:15	1	i don't like this person 
00:08:15	00:08:19	2	yeah i never think he's <unk> he's a murder and stuff like that 
00:08:19	00:08:20	1	mhm 
00:08:20	00:08:30	2	mhm and then there's the mike tyson thing that a lot of food you know happy about that and it'd be interesting to see what he has to say 
00:08:37	00:08:41	1	oh i can't even kiss my girlfriend and i was 
00:08:41	00:08:45	2	oh you do your girlfriend what is that 
00:08:45	00:08:49	1	so it's like he doesn't really know i don't know 
00:08:49	00:08:52	2	he i mean that's that he doesn't even have the 
00:08:52	00:09:06	1	six down you know like i think um like read it at the beginning stage i can i have the basics down and that's it but he doesn't even have that like i i mean before i can read that there was no like girlfriend boyfriend thing and 
00:09:06	00:09:09	2	mhm i know that stuff 
00:09:09	00:09:11	1	pork any of that stuff 
00:09:11	00:09:16	2	but i guess he's too yeah yeah 
00:09:16	00:09:24	1	he doesn't have control over his life but i think and so you know when people rag on him i i i tend to take the 
00:09:24	00:09:25	2	mhm 
00:09:25	00:09:27	1	like the side of yeah like 
00:09:27	00:09:30	2	mike tyson because he was 
00:09:30	00:09:32	1	even though i mean 
00:09:32	00:09:40	2	dead but it's it's not ah <unk> you know other people can kill him and tell them what to do and 
00:09:40	00:09:43	1	where to spend money and stuff like that 
00:09:43	00:09:56	2	yeah i mean i generally stay away from the t._v. anyway no i never know about everything except for when people talk about [laughter] and so um i forgot what t._v. yeah a grad student right

00:10:29	00:10:30	1	yeah what do you 
00:10:30	00:10:34	2	right exactly right what you've already graduated right

00:11:06	00:11:16	2	well what i really really love is like medieval stuff oh and that's the way i really think that like <unk> english and german goes together really well if you're interested in medieval 
00:11:16	00:11:17	1	<unk> 
00:11:17	00:11:34	2	in the past english and german used to be the same language like about the year before the year seven hundred wow you know 'cause like in europe it was all like wandering pagan tribes and they just like um they can't you know they came down the guy and all them 
00:11:34	00:11:35	1	mhm 
00:11:35	00:11:50	2	they used to i mean they spoke germanic language and some of them settled in germany some people kept on walking and kept on going to england and so the language gradually changed after that but um yeah you like um 
00:11:50	00:11:53	1	you know you hear though term anglo saxon is like that's the tribes 
00:11:53	00:11:56	2	i guess [laughter]

00:20:48	00:20:58	1	um there's still a modest and they still covered you know they're you know you never saw them like if they they interact with guys and 
00:21:18	00:21:29	2	yeah isn't it strange because i had like when when i had a pen pal from algeria that moved here and it was so funny because i knew more about it's not needed 
00:21:29	00:21:31	1	yeah but i didn't know that uh

00:21:38	00:21:42	1	i mean that's like pretty basic information yeah 
00:21:42	00:21:53	2	yeah that's how it was with her like she said she didn't she didn't pray and um okay she prayed and i've been <unk> knew what it meant so if i didn't know what that meant wow yeah so you know 
00:21:53	00:21:56	1	let me think winter like don't you wonder what you're saying 
00:22:27	00:22:34	1	the conservative aspect of islam you know so like everything else to me now it's like 
00:22:34	00:22:42	2	i mean i don't i don't wear a veil and address american but i'm just like when i see things i'm like you 
00:22:42	00:22:43	1	gosh that's 
00:22:43	00:22:46	2	and stuff like that you know yeah so 
00:22:46	00:22:48	1	i mean why why um 
00:22:59	00:23:13	2	yeah i mean i know for like i mean for me personally because you know before i became this i'm like i was in a number i wanted a lot of ways i was like like <unk> if i if i were you know where it where the scarves now and stuff it's like 
00:23:13	00:23:20	1	to keep myself from doing those things again or you know or even to protect other people from it meat or like myself 
00:23:20	00:23:22	2	yeah so you do it of course 
00:23:22	00:23:25	1	yeah i do yeah i've been wearing it for one year now 
00:23:25	00:23:27	2	wow well i mean what i'm 
00:23:27	00:23:29	1	like when i first 
00:23:29	00:23:30	2	or even actually before 
00:23:30	00:23:31	1	mhm 
00:23:46	00:23:47	1	so 
00:23:47	00:23:50	2	so and plus my boss 
00:23:50	00:23:58	1	happy if i were <unk> so so it that's how i started doing it but then when i got to germany um i started you know we're in the job 
00:23:58	00:24:05	2	and and and there are there are a lot of <unk> there's a lot of turkish people 
00:24:05	00:24:14	1	i mean the germans or not i mean there's there's a few german who are muslim but most of them are either married too um foreigners 
00:24:14	00:24:19	2	or there's disease mhm what is exactly that i don't know what that is 
00:24:19	00:24:27	1	it's like a certain i wouldn't say it's like a school 'cause they follow different like some of them i see on some of them are so many it's not really 
00:24:27	00:24:38	2	based upon that but it's like um they they do everything that the muslims do and then they also do extra things like meditation sort of exercises um and like chanting in a group 
00:24:38	00:24:41	1	and um 
00:24:41	00:24:45	2	like chanting the names of online stuff like that kind of like uh 
00:24:45	00:24:49	1	approach um um 
00:24:49	00:24:59	2	because whenever i ask people hear about that they said you know you might get confused you might want to be a sushi and stuff like that they don't really have a positive 
00:25:24	00:25:26	2	they'll they'll have like a men's circle and the women circle 
00:25:26	00:25:29	1	but there won't be occur in in between them 
00:25:29	00:25:40	2	you know so some muslims would be like whoa that's not modest but that's just the way they do it you know and like i feel totally comfortable there especially you know because 
00:25:40	00:25:43	1	i personally don't feel that comfortable 
00:25:43	00:25:48	2	praying behind a wall and not even being able to see the mom or something you know 
00:25:48	00:25:52	1	oh maybe that's what that's how it is eight and a must do there 
00:25:52	00:26:06	2	uh not have to wanna win state but like it the one near my house when women go on a separate room and we had to like if there is a uh sermon or whatever i could buy then we got to listen to it through like a loud speaker and the other room 
00:26:06	00:26:09	1	and in mind 
00:26:09	00:26:19	2	i kinda like it you know what else there is there downstairs so we can see them and they can't see us on this they turn around and you know that's like whoa you know what are you doing 
00:26:19	00:26:29	1	right so i mean it's kinda nice you know we see the <unk> in mom and everything and but we're just elevated so they can't see us 
00:26:29	00:26:37	2	unless they stand up and look up you know it seems like totally a suspect so it kinda works out 
00:26:41	00:26:42	1	mhm 
00:26:42	00:26:47	2	yeah i like it that way too i said that in summer it's really hot out there [laughter]
