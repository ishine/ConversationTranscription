00:08:42	00:08:44	2	[laughter] um but 
00:08:44	00:08:46	1	right i thought to myself

00:09:13	00:09:18	2	right you know going from one beach and having you know basking in the sunshine what's the point 
00:09:18	00:09:19	1	[laughter] 
00:09:19	00:09:28	2	that's right half of your higher purpose that's right you weren't orange just to soak up son that's right exactly so i i um i said here's an opportunity 
00:09:28	00:09:41	1	to see how a jewish family lives why not and providence would have it that there were it was a june night there was that friday night there were some over a hundred people who were going on a tour and who were set up for <unk> 
00:09:41	00:09:43	2	comedy and 
00:09:43	00:09:46	1	this rabbi rubber within sent me too 
00:09:46	00:10:03	2	um a rabbi simco washroom in the corner oklahoma he'd be rest in peace he was a a great rabbi whose father was one of the greatest rabbis in europe who um and he himself was very knowledgeable rabbi and i was told that i 
00:10:03	00:10:05	1	i um was was 
00:10:05	00:10:09	2	gonna i was going with three other boys two way uh 
00:10:23	00:10:26	1	afraid [laughter] 
00:10:26	00:10:39	2	that you know i'm going to the fried rice house and he's going to chastise me it's going to say you jewish boy is what you're doing with your life you should you should do something with your life for a change you should learn some <unk> what are you what what is that you just you just um 
00:10:41	00:10:55	2	university what is this you know want to see it was something for a change yes so when i got there it was i was pleasantly surprised to see nothing off the sword i was president surprised to see an older rabbi and his wife 
00:10:55	00:10:56	1	[noise] who 
00:10:56	00:11:03	2	who bantered with each other <unk> you know it's clearly deeply in love and um and 
00:11:03	00:11:06	1	i can't remember exactly what the rap i said but i remember 
00:11:06	00:11:18	2	impression that i had that had as i said i was like a little bit on the defensive a little bit afraid of you know being dragged into some cold i didn't know anything about traditional judaism 
00:11:18	00:11:20	1	[noise] um 
00:11:20	00:11:36	2	um so how did he approached me like offensively i think i would have you know been on the defensive i would have retract it but because he just was interested you know he was he just open himself up he opened up his home that was 
00:11:36	00:11:38	1	it was beautiful 
00:11:38	00:11:42	2	meal and uh a beautiful environment and he just opened up his 
00:11:42	00:11:43	1	his life to us 
00:11:43	00:11:52	2	um you know he and he i could tell he felt like a little bit [laughter] almost he felt sorry for 
00:11:52	00:11:53	1	yes and 
00:11:53	00:12:07	2	i thought to myself you know i i i can express some of the thoughts that i might have felt that that time that you know you feel sorry for me rabbi um five and a half a stigma as i honor is going for a doctorate in one of the top universities and couldn't 
00:12:07	00:12:09	1	oh gee you know i'm i i have uh 
00:12:09	00:12:17	2	future ahead of me and you live in a small apartment in jerusalem you know you're you're an older rabbi and you feel sorry for me so 
00:12:17	00:12:19	1	but he made me feel 
00:12:19	00:12:26	2	as if he's got a jew or not i don't think he was trying to do it you know in any 
00:12:26	00:12:27	1	um 
00:12:27	00:12:30	2	[noise] subversive man or he he just made me feel that that 
00:12:30	00:12:32	1	that he he wishes he quit 
00:12:32	00:12:51	2	share something with me but it's unfortunate that he really can't because of my lack of education so i was looking like i was trying to get a glimpse like what he's what he's holding their what kind of pearl he's holding their which really that pearl was was judaism you know he he was he was holding a very 
00:12:51	00:12:54	1	meaningful 
00:13:04	00:13:05	1	i admit some 
00:13:05	00:13:12	2	you know um some friends and some older people in my travels 
00:13:12	00:13:13	1	i 
00:13:13	00:13:23	2	considered <unk> people who i could learn from this was the person who i write away identified as as uh truly wise person he like he had 
00:13:23	00:13:26	1	windows which you know his eyes were like windows to hit 
00:13:26	00:13:31	2	which just spoke there it just spoke of a a deeper meaning 
00:13:31	00:13:32	1	in life yeah 
00:13:32	00:13:52	2	i didn't even know what the time that unfortunately he lost his entire family and the holocaust and then he didn't have children and his name <unk> joy hebrew and he was truly a joyful person he he told me i return many many times too with home after that first night and then i 
00:13:52	00:13:58	1	make much sense help with someone who had experience such tragedy and heartache be full of joy 
00:13:58	00:14:10	2	because he believed deeply and <unk> and god leading the universe and he told me that although he doesn't have children of his own he's got children all over the world 
00:14:10	00:14:12	1	he he said that he has 
00:14:12	00:14:18	2	children who send him you know his students it says in the <unk> the town would that your your students are like your children 
00:14:18	00:14:20	1	yeah and he has 
00:14:30	00:14:43	2	such a beautiful man he passed away a few years ago but he he he was a man who was able to touch many many people in the very delicate way in a very on offensive on obtrusive manner 
00:14:45	00:14:50	2	just the way i said that that you know just by educating them that that you know 
00:14:50	00:14:52	1	just telling them this is torah and 
00:14:52	00:15:08	2	and not not trying to convince them not trying to convert them you know <unk> i mean a jew with a jew whether he knows it or not but but anyway not you know not trying to get a person to do something against their will 
00:15:08	00:15:09	1	um you know 
00:15:09	00:15:27	2	the way that i that i that i look at that as it's someone who's truly connected to god wouldn't need to shame other people because you know as you know from psychology to me that comes from from the ego you know needing to be right and when you're connected with god you can be um a channel a vehicle for god's you know for the essence of 
00:15:27	00:15:38	1	god and that light becomes visible to the person that you're a connecting with and just as the rabbit open up their hearts in their home to you and you thought that they might shame 
00:15:38	00:15:41	2	you know into being a better do whatever they 
00:15:41	00:15:50	1	really expressing the light of god's through them and it's it's very difficult you know to not open up to that kind of of of energy and and and light 
00:15:50	00:15:54	2	right i mean it's <unk> um [noise] 
00:15:59	00:16:01	1	these type 
00:16:01	00:16:08	2	[noise] hello the line um it could be i don't know i think he 
00:16:08	00:16:12	1	we can just ignore it okay um 
00:16:12	00:16:18	2	i think there's a view of of this type of um you <unk> or you know these type of settings as 
00:16:18	00:16:21	1	as something that's trying to 
00:16:21	00:16:23	2	yeah um 
00:16:23	00:16:29	1	brainwashed or something you know a person and and i really don't see it that way i i 
00:16:29	00:16:33	2	oh i see it as just um 
00:16:51	00:16:53	1	it is um 
00:16:53	00:17:00	2	something very intense and now i look at it than you know as uh perhaps a form of brainwashing and that 
00:17:00	00:17:03	1	is your your your brain you are you are so 
00:17:03	00:17:07	2	plane so that you can see the the truth of god more quick 
00:17:07	00:17:08	1	[laughter] 
00:17:08	00:17:18	2	because it's you know when you were brought up in in traditional culture i mean i think that is it called i mean you know you're brainwashed to believe certain things you believe too 
00:17:18	00:17:22	1	um live a certain life you're <unk> you're you're you're you are given certain beliefs 
00:17:22	00:17:35	2	that you think give your life meaning you know buying more things believing certain things when in fact you can live a very meaningful life contributing to other people's lives without having 
00:17:35	00:17:37	1	material goods 
00:17:37	00:17:40	2	yeah um you know those are different values than most of the 
00:17:40	00:17:41	1	teachers 
00:17:41	00:17:55	2	as you know i mean i myself ah you know have <unk> have looked at different paths and i find that each pet has given me some very valuable <unk> hold on just sure one minute they'll show the other ones are okay 
00:17:55	00:17:56	2	hello 
00:17:56	00:17:58	1	yes i'm still here 
00:17:58	00:18:07	2	mhm

00:18:34	00:18:35	1	mhm 
00:18:35	00:18:45	2	sorry okay yeah so i'm one of the things that i um i i spent um well actually three months at the <unk> <unk> when a rap noah was there 
00:18:51	00:19:02	2	also there was another rabbi there i don't know if he's still there he um he had a clinical psychology background rub after lunch check money ah it could be um 
00:19:02	00:19:14	1	he was more um i mean he was the only rabbi there with a psychological the psychology background but i believe his first name was fill fill up rep i fill up and perhaps that was his name is he's still there 
00:19:14	00:19:22	2	um no i don't think i i i'm not sure if that's the one you know <unk> <unk> and you know you you 
00:19:22	00:19:32	1	you were mentioning that um you know through providence you met certain people right and um in my travels i don't know if you're <unk> if you're familiar at all with the um city yoga people at all

00:19:37	00:19:55	2	well um i find a lot of common things between certain practices and <unk> and <unk> and believe it or not um i mean and also there's a lot of misunderstandings between what certain religions truly are about even people's understanding of what judaism is truly about mhm because it's you know it's so easy to 
00:19:55	00:19:57	1	i'm confused 
00:19:57	00:19:58	2	forum for the essence 
00:19:58	00:20:00	1	mhm and what i 
00:20:00	00:20:12	2	what i believe now is that most of us think we know the reasons why we do certain things when in fact <unk> directing the show and i had the experience of 
00:20:12	00:20:13	1	really 
00:20:13	00:20:23	2	experiencing that i was not in control of my life that that i believe that i knew why why i was doing certain things when in fact i was being directed 
00:20:25	00:20:27	2	mhm and um 
00:20:27	00:20:28	1	do you know the word 
00:20:28	00:20:43	2	colin uh not the jewish recalling but the japanese were cone k. o. a. n. uh a question that you're rational mind cannot answer or a question that your mind cannot answer rationally the answer does not lie in the rational domain 
00:20:43	00:20:48	1	do you know that word cone no i don't know the word i i understand the concept you 
00:20:48	00:20:59	2	like what is the sound of one hand clapping you know those kinds of quest uh-huh uh-huh so the question that i was left with recently and and no matter where i go i'm always looking at you know what is you know what is the higher 
00:20:59	00:21:02	1	of what's going on here the question that i was left with 
00:21:02	00:21:09	2	when my car recently had a flat tire and [laughter] so i was sitting in a waiting room and i was very tight 
00:21:09	00:21:10	1	so i put myself into very <unk> 
00:21:10	00:21:26	2	plate of state and i said to myself you know it looks like things are going against me right now you know why is this happening wise that happening and the question that i asked myself as how can all these things be happening and yet in another way everything is <unk> 
00:21:37	00:21:40	2	fair in god's perspective 
00:21:40	00:21:42	1	oh is it you know what is going on here 
00:21:42	00:21:45	2	that um i am where i need to be 
00:21:45	00:21:46	1	mhm and if i 
00:21:46	00:21:56	2	where to look from a higher perspective that things would make sense in a spiritual way and sometimes i think in perhaps you've thought of is that when 
00:21:56	00:21:57	1	what looks 
00:21:57	00:22:15	2	a bad thing happening to you you ever think you know if i was in another place perhaps things would be even worse than this was god's compassion that he's showing it on me mhm by you know let's say give me a flat tire and putting me in a tire we had her right did you ever think of those things 
00:22:15	00:22:19	1	sure i've had um actually one of the <unk> 
00:22:38	00:22:40	1	just 
00:22:40	00:22:52	2	you know i i was in deeply impressed then i gradually um [noise] i heard about this <unk> and i came to hear a philosophy professor there 
00:22:52	00:22:53	1	uh-huh 
00:22:53	00:22:58	2	professor here uh dr <unk> done forgot leave a former festival philosophy 
00:22:58	00:23:00	1	john's hopkins university yes 
00:23:00	00:23:12	2	and um and i decided i i had enjoyed many philosophy lectures and uh oberlin and i wouldn't be interested in hearing the jewish philosophy uh class and he gave they 
00:23:12	00:23:14	1	uh very 
00:23:14	00:23:20	2	stimulating class i actually i even remember the subject it was on the individual with them 
00:23:20	00:23:21	1	versus 
00:23:21	00:23:25	2	uh community is a person and adam who 
00:23:26	00:23:40	2	in and out of my eyes to world you know it there there are just uh every one is an individual who binds together for certain purposes or as a person part of a team yeah he's a person part of a community because the person take on there 
00:23:47	00:23:48	1	some afterwards well 
00:23:48	00:23:52	2	you know maybe um i was a very strong individual less than i am so 
00:23:52	00:23:55	1	steak [laughter] um i 
00:23:55	00:23:59	2	believed that a person can't really experienced the deepest pleasures 
00:23:59	00:24:00	1	uh it's 
00:24:00	00:24:13	2	of another person or the pain you know even the husband brush him my father of ah children and although i can empathize with my wife i can't really go through childbirth with her completely she has to go through the physical pain and she 
00:24:13	00:24:15	1	she experiences much more joined in my experience 
00:24:15	00:24:21	2	[noise] but um [noise] i i 
00:24:27	00:24:28	1	individual component 
00:24:36	00:24:39	1	they they're not and they're not an ivory tower person 
00:24:39	00:24:45	2	living like a loan and you know ah independent from the community 
00:24:45	00:24:47	1	they they they <unk> as you 
00:24:47	00:25:00	2	that even in the secular society there very much affected by the world around them and they owe things too that world [noise] so um i asked him afterwards let's say 
00:25:00	00:25:09	1	you know let's give an example of young beethoven who comes to his parents and say i want to be you know i want to be you know they they knew he had talented music 
00:25:09	00:25:23	2	he wants to be another mozart you know he says i want to be the next door they laugh and they say that's ridiculous you can't be another mozart you know he was a genius he was he was he was brilliant you you want to be a musician be a tube of player the orchestra need to to play or do something practical 
00:25:23	00:25:28	1	so think of the tragedy had beethoven become a tube of play rather than uh than 
00:25:28	00:25:31	2	the pianist composer so he said well 
00:25:31	00:25:33	1	there are some times where the community 
00:25:33	00:25:37	2	doesn't understand what's what's best for it but he's 
00:25:37	00:25:46	1	beethoven's as <unk> even if he if he rebelled against his parents and became a pianist rather than uh impractical pianists rather than a than a <unk> 
00:25:46	00:25:56	2	go to ball player [noise] would be serving the community he would be helping the musical community and helping the world and creating his in in bringing out his strength to the dust that way [noise] 
00:25:56	00:25:58	1	i heard that class and i was 
00:26:02	00:26:15	2	[noise] and then afterwards student asked me what you know came up to me and said what's my name and where am i going to then go into the galley to go on egypt turkey my doctorate my internship professor you got the wrong guy probably not gonna do don't waste your breath 
00:26:20	00:26:24	2	freshly nothing you know um 
00:26:25	00:26:27	2	and i i 
00:26:27	00:26:28	1	i kept on thinking about that 
00:26:28	00:26:29	2	place like 
00:26:29	00:26:31	1	next day i was thinking about leaving jerusalem 
00:26:31	00:26:36	2	um but i kept on thinking about this place you know it was really interesting class maybe i should go back for another 
00:26:36	00:26:37	1	yes 
00:26:37	00:26:39	2	and um 
00:26:39	00:26:41	1	and i said why not you know like uh 
00:26:41	00:26:49	2	<unk> after all i'm traveling torn about myself and learn about the world and i caught myself that i was afraid of the place i was afraid of something there 
00:26:49	00:26:51	1	so i said you know work 
00:26:51	00:26:55	2	to be a little weary of brainwashing but but except for that you know 
00:26:55	00:26:57	1	i i'm a guy who can handle 
00:26:57	00:27:00	2	self and um and maybe i'll learn something 
00:27:00	00:27:02	1	[noise] so i came back and i it's 
00:27:02	00:27:08	2	i sat in on a few more classes and each one was very very satisfying very stimulating 
00:27:21	00:27:23	1	ups and downs like 
00:27:23	00:27:27	2	this is this the truth or if it's the truth if this 
00:27:27	00:27:28	1	the truth i should 
00:27:28	00:27:41	2	you know i should start to study it i should i should learn about it and it's answering more questions than all my studies the philosophy and literature and psychology and different thoughts in the world than anything i'd 
00:27:41	00:27:43	1	[noise] but i said 
00:27:43	00:27:51	2	but then there was this voice inside of me and saying that but what about you know the chinese restaurant i won't be able to go out for the chinese restaurants 
00:27:51	00:27:53	1	my family and it's 
00:28:04	00:28:10	2	and i decided well i'm going to be breeze and take it day by day 
00:28:10	00:28:10	1	and see 
00:28:10	00:28:24	2	you know i i really think of it i i was a person who was searching and i was a person who was not going to accept something blindly [noise] i was i wanted to debate i i did debate with people quite actively 
00:28:24	00:28:25	1	and um 
00:28:34	00:28:42	2	<unk> you know i never believed in truth i had resolved myself to be an existential left because the truth didn't make sense to me 
00:28:42	00:28:43	1	truth like what's 
00:28:50	00:28:52	1	[noise] what's something that just didn't make sense to me 
00:28:52	00:29:02	2	in my education up to that point [noise] and so i'd resolve myself to be an existential lists you know we live in a world where we have to create our own truth mhm because 
00:29:02	00:29:04	1	because the truth just didn't 
00:29:04	00:29:14	2	there was nothing that suggested itself of an absolute truth it made any sense to me and all of a sudden i was confronted with a question uh that that may be <unk> 
00:29:14	00:29:19	1	truth does make sense yes and so i um 
00:29:21	00:29:24	1	uh uh you know i i went through 
00:29:24	00:29:36	2	my ups and down there at the beginning and then i just decided that look i'm not going to i see that these questions are very very deep um these are questions which have been debated 
00:29:51	00:30:00	1	three more than you know try to sum it up yeah do you have any more questions <unk> so let me just try to someone so then then um that on that point i i just decided
