00:05:48	00:05:53	1	i don't and land you know it's expensive here but i was wondering 
00:05:53	00:05:58	2	the worst part about buying land here is getting a loan from the bank because it's like three hundred percent 
00:06:09	00:06:10	1	mhm 
00:06:10	00:06:12	2	well i don't even know 
00:06:12	00:06:15	1	i don't even know if you could ask a banker that question like 
00:06:15	00:06:19	2	there is no oh yeah that wouldn't bother me that 
00:06:19	00:06:27	1	the hearing that here in the philippines if you're in oh advice you even ask a baker that you're you know you're in over your head 
00:06:27	00:06:38	2	john that's not even in any of the bank or would even think about i would say i <unk> i would simply asking but what kind of ethically like let's say let's say you're 
00:06:38	00:06:46	1	<unk> buying a home that <unk> in in philippines you would have to pay an and american money uh fifty thousand dollars 
00:06:46	00:06:52	2	[noise] no well i would do is i would take out a loan yes and by the land here 
00:06:52	00:06:58	1	but you gotta have money to buy the land do you have the money to buy the land how much do you have 
00:06:58	00:06:59	2	no how much the land is oh 
00:06:59	00:07:01	1	let's see i just pray 
00:07:01	00:07:04	2	[noise] my calculators upstairs on my desk please

00:07:23	00:07:25	1	the value is that a true value 
00:07:38	00:07:40	2	'cause the bank you know i'm going to be in it 
00:07:40	00:07:42	1	maybe in a year i could 
00:07:42	00:07:49	2	because the bank isn't gonna give you more than about seventy eighty percent eight seventy percent i would say would be a norm 
00:07:54	00:07:57	2	is what i'm lakey mhm uh 
00:07:57	00:07:59	1	so you'd have to have the other three 
00:08:15	00:08:29	2	i don't know well well you know those are all things i thought about before because you know let me tell us thinking here ten thousand times twenty five 
00:08:29	00:08:30	1	mhm

00:10:41	00:10:43	1	i guess you'd have to do 
00:10:43	00:10:49	2	so anyway let's just okay let's see what no no no those are true price okay what other <unk> what i'm saying 
00:10:49	00:11:05	1	know lending institution in the united states that i can believe that i can think of would give you more than maybe seventy percent of what the value is and if i would have to be established so you that are 
00:11:05	00:11:14	2	value was let's say the value is thirty six thousand yeah dollars thirty six thousand dollars 
00:11:14	00:11:18	1	yeah so you'd have to go on for thirty percent that'd be ten thousand 
00:11:18	00:11:19	2	mhm 
00:11:19	00:11:21	1	huh 
00:11:21	00:11:39	2	the bank would not i don't know but it would lend on they can property if it was a home you know for <unk> bridges if there was a home on it that could be read that for an income than an institution might say well this is just you know i appreciate that a lot that's what i mean that's i mean how much is bacon property 
00:11:39	00:11:40	1	worth 
00:11:40	00:11:43	2	in in value as opposed to a piece of property 
00:11:43	00:11:45	1	what a whole monitor that 
00:11:45	00:12:05	2	be rented the bank would say well wait a minute we can if that thing don't work if this guy don't make it uh we can rent that partially we get our money back if we only have seventy percent invested i would say that generally but i'd be glad to talk to them but that's generally and in fact seventy percent as high uh 
00:12:05	00:12:07	1	open land 
00:12:07	00:12:07	2	upper

00:13:06	00:13:14	2	but there is a growing middle class and that's what these lots are targeted at the growing middle class but the middle class is pretty high class 
00:13:14	00:13:17	1	if they can spend that kind of money

00:14:47	00:14:50	1	you did it we have in your base yeah she did uh 
00:14:50	00:14:53	2	<unk> i think i think would work 
00:14:53	00:15:05	1	do i uh um you know because we don't like to build a lot of stuff on the wall i think what i'm going to do is get some pieces of plywood like about two feet by eight feet long and hang 'em <unk> rafters 
00:15:05	00:15:08	2	and put stuff on that 'cause well not just 
00:15:08	00:15:11	1	the free just build a free standing <unk> uh free standing 
00:15:11	00:15:27	2	show from the floor yeah we might do that with some blocks or something uh well that that's an idea too yeah but just or if <unk> if blocks are cheaper than what well but it could have um just because you're that always just like 
00:15:27	00:15:28	1	had in the basement yeah but 
00:15:28	00:15:31	2	sat up instead of being built into the wall 
00:15:31	00:15:33	1	instead of being built in the wall they'd be free 
00:15:33	00:15:47	2	yeah you have to find some way to the wall uh well maybe yeah you'd have to faster they could just be they could just maybe <unk> yeah okay well maybe not yeah whatever we yeah i i agree i'm leona does too we talk 
00:15:47	00:16:04	1	about it and as soon as money mentioned it and i said yes that's right we can't let that stop sit there although the base but it was nice and dry but it's just well i know it's i know i'm gonna try and everything yeah it's not that it's not the condition of the items you know the fact that kids are down there unsupervised 
00:16:11	00:16:13	2	to agree that that is a possibility 
00:16:27	00:16:28	1	no i <unk> 
00:16:28	00:16:34	2	<unk> maybe maybe we could do something different maybe we could actually partition somehow 
00:16:34	00:16:40	1	and and close it as opposed to trying to cause we put her on shelves they're still gonna be able to get at it 
00:16:48	00:16:51	1	we just as cheap as we do that 
00:16:51	00:17:05	2	just <unk> down there who were told not to go in the bedroom and they are in the bedroom and found christmas presents under the bed i said when you tell them not to go in the bedroom what the hell are they gonna do 
00:17:05	00:17:06	1	they're going to go in the bedroom 
00:17:06	00:17:13	2	and only natural when there are there uh lawn definitely like you know we were told that not looking at it must be something really good there 
00:17:13	00:17:16	1	oh yeah i 
00:17:16	00:17:18	2	well anyway we'll we'll see what we can do about that 
00:17:18	00:17:24	1	it's just that you know some of the things are really some of the things are really 
00:17:29	00:17:43	1	that's what i told larry larry i said you don't know what why something is important to them it's not important to you but you don't know why so yeah there's no intent to do any but but uh protected so it doesn't get 
00:17:43	00:18:00	2	well and if <unk> clean feels that way how much more you know all the cousins are down there you know especially you know some of the younger ones yeah they don't know i mean it clear it's five years old and she goes up to my office looking for scratch paper sometimes you know and and and they just kids have absolutely no idea what values 
00:18:00	00:18:09	1	right um okay okay well uh it's it's been noted and we'll take care of it well 
00:18:09	00:18:18	2	oh really <unk> and also not that i feel incredibly guilty having to ask you to do i don't know why i know what you're doing uh well yeah but i i think you're right i think 
00:18:18	00:18:19	1	and <unk> and i talked 
00:18:19	00:18:21	2	develop that very thing that 
00:18:21	00:18:26	1	is the reason enough to be concerned ah to put it in some kind of a condition so that 
00:18:26	00:18:33	2	nobody disturbs <unk> and even though you know somebody might think it's uh not what the hell of a lot that's none of our 
00:18:33	00:18:36	1	fair because now you guys have um 
00:18:36	00:18:43	2	working working we're confused about your guys address okay one three to four or one three 
00:18:43	00:18:48	1	it was only two four six <unk> three too 
00:18:48	00:18:57	2	yeah the metal viewed as a matter of you two words or one <unk> two words and there was an l. and besides it's late metal view 
00:18:57	00:19:01	1	but i don't mean <unk> i guess but yes i see her last let or just 
00:19:01	00:19:04	2	so so there is no metal views three 
00:19:04	00:19:06	1	no there is not that's right 
00:19:06	00:19:14	2	okay but so lane is important but i mean not yet because there's no matter you street but it's <unk> some day in the future you never know their couldn't okay thought is one three too 
00:19:14	00:19:16	1	four yup yup 
00:19:16	00:19:19	2	and what did you say you notice that my last letter what 
00:19:19	00:19:25	1	that your address that metal view instead of uh view laying but that's not a concern
