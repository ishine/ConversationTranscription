00:00:06	00:00:07	1	[laughter] 
00:00:07	00:00:16	2	oh where are you i'm good how are you good um first of all i know they're happy birthday and uh uh your presence it will be coming 
00:00:16	00:00:18	1	okay thank you 
00:00:18	00:00:20	2	thank you for calling things were so crazy 
00:00:20	00:00:22	1	last week and then 
00:00:22	00:00:32	2	[noise] i finally got it together to call you and then the pin number had run out of the time so i had to wait another week and then last week didn't work and so i have to wait another week and 
00:00:35	00:00:38	2	[noise] pretty terrible yeah it's really awful 
00:00:59	00:01:00	1	because otherwise it is these 
00:01:00	00:01:10	2	past week should be crazy crazy crazy i know jesse told me you are so busy you couldn't go see mom yeah right that was really a nuisance and she didn't even acknowledge [laughter] 
00:01:10	00:01:12	1	problem 
00:01:12	00:01:18	2	and everyone she was having a wonderful place oh wow [laughter] and i'm going to 
00:01:18	00:01:32	1	yes where you're old yeah anyway i'm sorry that she didn't even acknowledge that but yeah probably hit her later you know no but she she did to remember but it seems that this had been a bit <unk> <unk> the the idea of of getting somebody else to pay was a good i 
00:01:36	00:01:39	1	and and that's nice because she can do that much more often 
00:01:39	00:01:50	2	yeah it's wonderful for her so so that was really jazz yeah anyway so you guys had a nice time except for that too is uh just as a father okay yeah he's doing pretty well 
00:01:50	00:01:58	1	oh he's you know he had a very mild stroke i think if you have a stroke at all he had the best kind you can have mhm 
00:01:58	00:02:00	2	um and evidently it's 
00:02:00	00:02:03	1	he hasn't irregular heartbeat which is what they say 
00:02:03	00:02:09	2	caused it the kind that if it's a regular all the time um evidently it 
00:02:09	00:02:11	1	causes the possibility of cause 
00:02:11	00:02:14	2	clot is very high 
00:02:14	00:02:15	1	and so 
00:02:15	00:02:24	2	um they i don't quite understand if they're going to do this or not but sometimes they administer a small shocked to try and get it sort of 
00:02:24	00:02:25	1	track 
00:02:25	00:02:28	2	um so it gets back to normal beat 
00:02:28	00:02:30	1	but otherwise he just tried with drugs or something 
00:02:30	00:02:42	2	well no what they do is they um give him drugs for an anti coagulating and so that whatever clot within their own cause that hopefully gets dissolved 
00:02:45	00:02:56	2	mostly because for example a week and a half ago they said okay um you can't shave until we see you [laughter] [noise] in other words you're bleed to death if you uh 
00:02:56	00:02:57	1	uh-huh

00:04:36	00:04:45	2	uh i'm not sure but anyway for the time being a normal uh-huh uh-huh it's a it's going through with it getting back to normal it seems like going through your email 
00:04:45	00:04:46	1	uh-huh and

00:05:42	00:05:46	1	nothing like fiesta i mean it was nothing and that's probably 
00:06:07	00:06:18	2	but what is <unk> anyway and um yeah well it's i don't know it's a general term i mean they have that new mexico too it's just it's a hispanic celebration i don't know 
00:06:36	00:06:38	1	performing fairly 
00:06:38	00:06:42	2	right make up and they look so proud of themselves 
00:06:56	00:06:58	1	thing and 
00:06:58	00:07:03	2	yeah [noise] sorry been singing and stuff like that so

00:07:19	00:07:27	1	has a big party and ah i don't i don't know if there's anything connected to it or not but anyway that was 
00:07:27	00:07:33	2	yeah so uh <unk> and and then we had but then they've been there since in the meantime to what your place 
00:07:35	00:07:39	2	after yeah right when did it when uh i'm just father had to 
00:07:39	00:07:41	1	that's right that's very true 
00:07:41	00:07:43	2	<unk> um 
00:07:43	00:07:46	1	the times 'cause they went to congratulate you on the cowboy boots that hurts 
00:07:46	00:07:50	2	oh yeah boy are they cute there that was so sweet of them you know that 
00:07:53	00:08:04	2	before that and remembered which is amazing to me and i kept refusing to try them on because i thought [noise] you know why should i try to monitor two hundred dollars i'm not gonna buy them but anyway she remembers 
00:08:04	00:08:06	1	that was really really sweet 
00:08:06	00:08:10	2	[noise] and um anyway i have them that was it was fun 
00:08:10	00:08:12	1	unfortunately 
00:08:12	00:08:16	2	that all happened with drug his dad right when we were going to go somewhere 
00:08:16	00:08:16	1	yeah 
00:08:16	00:08:18	2	[noise] um 
00:08:18	00:08:27	1	we had a fun time anyway and some friends of mine we're looking around um port or you know we're just seem to jesse tell you where they went and stayed 
00:08:39	00:08:52	2	mhm and it's just this little beautiful canyon that looks like paradise the minute you walk into it and they have little cabins for rent there and when josh my first visited before we even moved here we both just went 
00:08:53	00:08:55	2	by one of those cabins right 
00:08:55	00:08:56	1	taking it again 
00:08:56	00:09:08	2	forget about having a cat [laughter] we can have a cafe were one person the day comes and has a cup of coffee in yes anyway it's really really pretty and evidently michael <unk> 
00:09:08	00:09:09	1	mhm 
00:09:09	00:09:17	2	actually jesse went with him years and years ago when he was at u._c._l._a. there's a research station up in this canyon and 
00:09:17	00:09:22	1	oh yeah because she had said to me that they didn't stay there they want to have something a bit more uh 
00:09:22	00:09:24	2	yeah different yeah right 
00:09:24	00:09:27	1	anyway so that's how that spot 
00:09:27	00:09:45	2	[noise] came into the picture and they finally went there and stayed there and had a wonderful time <unk> and some friends of mine who live here we're looking at property for sale all over the place and that was one of the places they were looking in that particular area and so i got them to give me the real estate map of where 
00:09:45	00:09:47	1	wasn't sent it to just 
00:09:57	00:10:07	2	yeah well i you know i figure i mean it's none of my business and you know it's it's hard to say what what people you know i asked i asked jesse point blank you know can you 
00:10:07	00:10:09	1	[noise] <unk> 
00:10:09	00:10:18	2	to buy something right now it's you know their land here relatively speaking it's really cheap i mean like five hundred dollars and acre you know and she said yeah so 
00:10:18	00:10:20	1	thought shit 
00:10:20	00:10:37	2	whatever happens maybe they should just buy some land and you know whatever they can come and camp on it you know when they come to visit because they don't like bed and breakfasts and you know it's sometimes it's good when you have the money to get things you want because we didn't dawn 
00:10:37	00:10:43	1	getting getting places for a long time and they just never get around to get any place yeah i know 
00:10:43	00:10:55	2	i think i mean i'm just imagining you know what their position is because it's i'm sure it's it's very hard when you're doing something and you can't get out of it you know to do any any 
00:10:55	00:10:59	1	but but they can at least to have you know some vacation time or something 
00:10:59	00:11:08	2	right or you know whatever whatever happens in the future if you buy some land it's yours you know i mean and the taxes on it or nothing 
00:11:08	00:11:09	1	you can always sell it in 
00:11:09	00:11:14	2	yeah but now is the time because real estate's really going on 
00:11:14	00:11:19	1	around here now um southeastern arizona's gotten a lot of attention and 
00:11:19	00:11:20	2	i think there's lots of 
00:11:20	00:11:24	1	urban refugee type stuff happening where people are 
00:11:24	00:11:26	2	[noise] on him 
00:11:26	00:11:35	1	more and more with the city and they don't know what to do or how to leave for how to make a living but a lot of people just come here and go fucking i'll figure something out 
00:11:35	00:11:36	2	yeah so 
00:11:36	00:11:38	1	kind of a strange thing 
00:11:38	00:11:39	2	be happening 
00:11:53	00:11:54	1	and 
00:11:54	00:11:57	2	anyway so i've been trying to <unk> um 
00:11:57	00:12:01	1	[noise] so i told him that we would go and look at this property if they wanted 
00:12:01	00:12:03	2	but um 
00:12:43	00:12:45	1	yeah and then in breakfast place that drives me crazy 
00:12:45	00:12:56	2	yeah it's it's kind of it's not my thing i actually found a little apartment i mean this would be for you too if you were interested in it um our houses 
00:12:56	00:12:57	1	hard to 
00:12:57	00:13:08	2	i mean we can't one person's okay with two it gets pretty hard but the way we just changed everything around and it it's really not much of privacy at all for you know people visiting but 
00:13:08	00:13:10	1	we just found some uh 
00:13:10	00:13:22	2	instead of ours that come to the cafe they have a very small apartment that they rent two people visiting which you know has a little tiny kitchen and mhm it's just very nice and private 
00:13:22	00:13:23	1	yeah right you just have your own place 
00:13:23	00:13:28	2	right so it's not a hotel or it's not a place like some of these places and does beer 
00:13:28	00:13:30	1	you know the bathrooms down the hall 
00:13:30	00:13:33	2	<unk> yeah not so much fun huh 
00:13:33	00:13:38	1	expenses besides and other than that there are these nice been breakfast but anyway that's a nice 
00:13:38	00:13:40	2	and it's thirty bucks a night 
00:13:40	00:13:43	1	because they have an extra apartments 
00:13:58	00:14:01	1	that's all you have to do we have to build yourself in in my apartment 
00:14:01	00:14:10	2	[noise] right well just blast a hole in the rock underneath our house [laughter] that'd be nice 
00:14:10	00:14:13	1	yeah anyway how's the how's business going you sick 
00:14:13	00:14:27	2	it's going okay this month it's been kind of slow but for the most part it's we're doing pretty good it's you know it's uh [noise] we live in such a small town that you have to sort of gear your expectations down on them 
00:14:27	00:14:28	1	mhm 
00:14:28	00:14:33	2	you know when you live in a town that's only got sixty five hundred people in it 
00:14:33	00:14:34	1	um 
00:14:49	00:14:50	1	mhm but i most 
00:14:50	00:14:56	2	the time we feel really pretty lucky that we are have done as well as we have 
00:14:56	00:14:58	1	given given how small the town is 
00:14:58	00:15:08	2	all that yeah the the question is simply to rationalize in in a way that too and you're making enough money in that still fun for you yeah that's the you know i'm young 
00:15:08	00:15:10	1	figure out what what's the best way to rationalize 
00:15:10	00:15:20	2	yeah yeah it's hard to say 'cause sometimes you getting another mood like a string of things happen like josh is dead and he had to go away and that was kind of expensive for us to 
00:15:20	00:15:21	1	[noise] replace him and then uh 
00:15:21	00:15:29	2	course you know he's upset and everybody's upset and i was upset and that gets exhausting and then you know the next 
00:15:29	00:15:32	1	the first days off we had together i went 
00:15:32	00:15:35	2	i got stung by a scorpion which is no big deal it's just that 
00:15:35	00:15:39	1	i heard it was horrible pain for me it <unk> it it it was 
00:15:39	00:15:51	2	<unk> long i mean i had to ice my leg ten minutes on ten minutes off for twelve hours which is really boring [laughter] yeah and it's a real i mean there goes your whole day you know and 
00:15:51	00:15:55	1	they don't they have pain pills for that no they don't actually <unk> 
00:15:55	00:15:57	2	not that i know of any way that's all they tell you 
00:15:57	00:15:59	1	is to just do that and 
00:15:59	00:16:06	2	[noise] you know i did it for so i actually gave myself a little frostbite i mean i <unk> i made a little burn on my leg 
00:16:09	00:16:14	1	well for how long can you keep track of ten minutes on and ten years off and <unk> you know 
00:16:14	00:16:23	2	it was really ridiculous and it's you know <unk> once you find out you're not allergic to them and you're not going to have convulsions and die you know it's 
00:16:23	00:16:30	1	no big deal except that it hurt like holy hell i mean you <unk> it's like uh it's like uh 
00:16:45	00:16:47	1	and the cafe 
00:16:47	00:16:53	2	[noise] one day it backed up at ten o'clock in the morning on saturday you don't want that we did in life 
00:16:53	00:16:55	1	[laughter] 
00:17:01	00:17:03	1	you know a few weeks in a row 
00:17:03	00:17:07	2	mhm your mood kinda tends to go to hell 
00:17:07	00:17:10	1	that you didn't tell her level is somewhere around zero 
00:17:10	00:17:28	2	yeah and you start going this sucks you know and i'm sick of being poor and i'm sick of these calls and then it goes away and you go oh it's not so bad you know we're really not too bad you know we're really pretty lucky in a lot of ways so it's that's on trying to say is your 
00:17:28	00:17:31	1	food sort of it's hard to it's hard to judge the 
00:17:31	00:17:34	2	things sometimes you know it's um 
00:17:34	00:17:36	1	so how is it this week this week was 
00:17:36	00:17:39	2	just fine this week was fine 
00:17:39	00:17:43	1	um and uh 
00:17:43	00:17:54	2	you know it's very quiet downtown so we don't take it personally that were that the businesses will quiet and it's it's not that quiet either so you also didn't have these <unk> people coming in 
00:18:12	00:18:15	1	lunch is more of a luxury so you you haven't even small 
00:18:15	00:18:24	2	pool of people who worked for the county for example mhm and have you know really steady jobs um but we have a really nice 
00:18:24	00:18:24	1	lunch 
00:18:24	00:18:29	2	especially from the court house there's a group of the whole public defenders office 
00:18:29	00:18:35	1	and and they're really fun bunch when they always have these wild arguments which are really 
00:18:35	00:18:38	2	fun and interesting to listen to him [laughter] 
00:18:38	00:18:41	1	[noise] yeah you get to watch the local politics and everything 
00:18:41	00:18:53	2	yeah you do actually and uh they're really smart you know um for the most part liberal bunch who are very open about lots of you know the things that they think and i guess public 
00:18:53	00:18:55	1	there's offices or 
00:18:55	00:18:58	2	are generally um usually pretty liberal 
00:18:58	00:19:01	1	do gooder type you know people mhm 
00:19:01	00:19:12	2	who wanna you know they don't get paid very much and basically you know it's it's all sort of you know it's subsidized you know um defence for people who can't afford 
00:19:12	00:19:14	1	hi or a lawyer mhm 
00:19:14	00:19:18	2	um but they're really nice bunch and so they're <unk> idealistic doing some like 
00:19:18	00:19:19	1	yeah they are although there 
00:19:19	00:19:27	2	there you know very down to earth when you talk to them about you know what it means to try and be a do good are and how quickly you learn that 
00:19:27	00:19:31	1	you know they uh one woman that i'm 
00:19:31	00:19:35	2	really friendly with it's a public defender and like her a lot um 
00:19:35	00:19:36	1	[noise] 
00:19:36	00:19:52	2	she is in the juvenile department and no it's particularly frustrating 'cause there's screwed up kids and the parents are screwed up too and you know she'll ask them you know what's their name and what happened and they'll say i didn't do it 
00:19:52	00:19:53	1	well 
00:19:53	00:20:02	2	just tell me what happens you know and then mom will say he didn't do it you know she's <unk> just just tell me what happens you know [noise] then the next time they have enough 
00:20:02	00:20:05	1	but they don't show up right and so here's 
00:20:05	00:20:14	2	the public defender trying to say to the judge they're coming really really they are coming you know after days and days of preparing to defend this person that's 
00:20:14	00:20:18	1	questionable anyway so anyway it's 
00:20:28	00:20:33	1	it's a little bit like dorf where people say so 
00:20:33	00:20:41	2	that's all you're walking out your front door where were you going this afternoon [laughter] hey what do you mean just walking out the front door and never mind 
00:20:53	00:20:57	2	it that well that's part of life and that kind of situation because there's not that much else to do 
00:20:57	00:21:00	1	right right and they also it's 
00:21:00	00:21:16	2	fairly friendly for the most part once in a while people get kinda vicious and picky about it and it turns me off a lot and i people tell me stuff i wish i don't want to hear it you know i mean i just wish they didn't tell sometimes i tell people i don't want to hear it you know just don't even tell me 
00:21:16	00:21:17	1	[noise] 
00:21:17	00:21:21	2	but um for the most part it's pretty friendly because i think also 
00:21:21	00:21:24	1	since you're sort of stuck with each other here you 
00:21:24	00:21:35	2	our inspired and motivated to get along because for the most part everybody's gonna stay here [laughter] yeah my <unk> that's a very special thing 'cause there's a higher level 
00:21:35	00:21:37	1	tolerance for them mhm 
00:21:45	00:21:46	1	[noise] i i enjoy 
00:21:46	00:21:50	2	being greeted by people it's um i find it 
00:21:50	00:21:52	1	it's it takes me a little getting used to 
00:21:52	00:22:02	2	like i visited berkley this summer and everybody the minute they see you they look away like they're scared you know what you're going to do something to them 
00:22:08	00:22:11	1	well you can't afford to be because you can still see the person every 
00:22:11	00:22:19	2	right right but also that fear of i don't know when when you're in a larger place i think it just naturally 
00:22:20	00:22:36	2	too much stimulation i mean you just get over stimulated if you said if you said hide every single person you saw walking in the streets of geneva you'd be a wreck in an hour you know [laughter] cats you know i mean actually i think people have the 
00:22:36	00:22:41	1	small culture is like in your business so that you know you have your 
00:22:41	00:22:50	2	yeah right do you <unk> you know the different but in the neighborhood too there's there's this wonderful guy who uh <unk> i don't know where he lives we live somewhere but he always walks around here
