00:21:53	00:22:02	2	and it just [noise] you know that type of thing doesn't go over very well um i really from the top down 
00:22:02	00:22:12	1	we had talked about it our faculty meeting um well i guess last year we had decided to institute <unk> no hats policy you know 
00:22:12	00:22:13	2	mhm 
00:22:13	00:22:16	1	because the kids are getting 
00:22:16	00:22:26	2	a little careless about wearing all sorts of stuff to school yeah and uh then at the faculty meeting somebody said to him well you know what about had been 
00:22:26	00:22:28	1	you know it's 
00:22:28	00:22:37	2	soon as you make a policy like that china no it always goes to what else you know mhm or the links have skirts or some yeah 
00:22:37	00:22:47	1	so he said well you know it doesn't really matter uh he said there aren't very many people was had been he said i think they're only a couple of days he said i don't think we need to um 
00:22:47	00:22:55	2	you know in food that and then someone said oh and what about these big u. penn so i don't know if your kids wear those 
00:22:55	00:22:59	1	you know they [noise] no i don't play a lot

00:23:15	00:23:23	1	uh ban it from your own classroom if you want but i don't think we'll pick policy about well okay so then that's all it went on at the facts to me anyway

00:24:07	00:24:19	2	well we do have the announcements over the bulletin over the t._v. so everybody says here at the morning announcements come over television broadcasting studio and why did they do the morning announcements 
00:24:19	00:24:22	1	so it is at least 
00:24:22	00:24:24	2	that's one good thing 
00:24:24	00:24:26	1	it is distributed to everybody 
00:24:26	00:24:36	2	same way mhm but nevertheless you know yeah and there was something else that came in like that you know just has like an announcement 
00:24:36	00:24:38	1	mhm 
00:24:38	00:24:45	2	[noise] and then you never know i mean that's one thing but you never know when the next

00:25:20	00:25:23	1	no no 
00:25:23	00:25:42	2	[noise] and um so he said fine that wasn't a problem but later on and he said to me he acknowledge to me after he <unk> he didn't realize that he was in my algebra two class the whole class 
00:25:42	00:25:44	1	oh my gosh 
00:25:44	00:25:47	2	and

00:27:10	00:27:13	2	kinds of recording [laughter] 
00:27:13	00:27:17	1	[laughter] i said to her you know <unk> other people call the same person they said 
00:27:17	00:27:18	2	mhm 
00:27:18	00:27:22	1	because they're really only checking on my voice i think that's 
00:27:23	00:27:25	1	because they didn't ask me any quests 
00:27:25	00:27:45	2	about you oh you know just asked about me [laughter] so it's better than those calls up state fair yes [laughter] three minutes when you don't get anything sad right yeah yeah [noise] so how is lisa

00:28:12	00:28:14	1	so that's 
00:28:14	00:28:18	2	mhm something worthwhile anyway mhm 
00:28:18	00:28:29	1	but the class that she has a hard time with is she is um [noise] they scheduled to her to teach german one and two in the same class <unk> and that's 
00:28:29	00:28:31	2	oh yeah 
00:28:31	00:28:38	1	they have four kids who are taking german too and she's supposed to teach them

00:29:07	00:29:09	1	think it's 'cause she was 
00:29:09	00:29:20	2	to be mean um no i think she i mean that could be some of it but i think she actually just doesn't know any better you know <unk> i mean they tried to 
00:29:20	00:29:26	1	but when when a couple of the parents objected they tried to excuses by saying 
00:29:26	00:29:29	2	oh oh 
00:29:43	00:29:51	1	mhm i mean just doesn't make sense the one is going way beyond where the other one was and
