00:10:48	00:10:50	1	no you gotta tell you the phone and not a car 
00:10:50	00:10:56	2	phone but at the same thing well here's well you're right on there about the size of a regular 
00:11:11	00:11:14	2	how is the <unk> the day that we 
00:11:14	00:11:20	1	the connection was real good yeah yeah this connection is so so this is a weird connection can you can you hear the <unk> 
00:11:20	00:11:21	2	france yeah there's a <unk> 
00:11:21	00:11:27	1	there's a yeah there's a little delay and that's why when we talk back and forth sometimes you get that and sometimes you don't 
00:11:27	00:11:38	2	right it's like a walkie talkie with your cell phone right now right now yeah because when we're done with when you're done with the sentence or words it's almost like a click or something 
00:11:38	00:11:41	1	yeah maybe that's because of the recording thing 
00:11:41	00:11:53	2	no we get that sometimes and sometimes you don't sometimes it's like right next door you can't even believe someone's calling long distance and all that time like this sometimes to delete is even more pronounced and it's a real awkward 
00:11:53	00:11:54	1	conversation yeah 
00:11:54	00:11:57	2	that was like that when we first called you when you were first in the philippines 
00:11:57	00:11:59	1	well that was because we had the old 
00:11:59	00:12:00	2	system yeah that was 
00:12:00	00:12:05	1	we got this new is the first year that we had a new phone system it was just 
00:12:05	00:12:14	2	wonderful because the lines were just it was just like the next door but now so many people have phones at the line systems are overloaded and yeah anyway 
00:12:17	00:12:21	2	<unk> get a cut off their told me to tell you some bad news 
00:12:21	00:12:23	1	yeah um 
00:12:23	00:12:26	2	got to beaumont webster medical clinic dell 
00:12:26	00:12:27	1	yeah 
00:12:27	00:12:30	2	of a hundred and sixty seven dollars 
00:12:30	00:12:30	1	uh-huh

00:13:18	00:13:25	2	injection yeah that too yeah that doesn't surprise me that doesn't surprise me i thought we were getting off a little bit easy on those injections 
00:13:25	00:13:32	1	one for laurie than injection and one for john as an injection and the other just says non allowable by insurance that's all it 
00:13:32	00:13:49	2	those were injections that we had to have to come over here um and um i work is already paid us for it and i was wondering i i thought that maybe they weren't supposed to uh so in other words we can pay it in any terms we want to right so <unk> we'll pay twenty five dollars a month until it's gone 
00:13:49	00:13:59	1	okay twenty five now they might after ninety days start giving you finance 'cause they do for me and i go to the same clinic 
00:13:59	00:14:01	2	this is there a mistake told that the government i won't be 
00:14:01	00:14:04	1	after after twenty five a month 
00:14:04	00:14:07	2	no <unk> it's real good about 
00:14:07	00:14:16	1	yeah and you know i could i could pay the whole thing right up front but if they're willing to finance me i'm not gonna that's right if um 
00:14:16	00:14:19	2	okay then secondly um of and 
00:14:19	00:14:22	1	well i'm all do fifty if i have two but i'd rather just 
00:14:22	00:14:23	2	uh well we'll try twenty five 
00:14:23	00:14:25	1	right okay 
00:14:25	00:14:28	2	oh fifty if you have to [noise] all right and then <unk> 
00:14:40	00:14:42	1	just the same way a hundred a month 
00:14:42	00:14:48	2	oh is that what is that what you been doing yeah then how come you didn't know that 
00:14:48	00:14:52	1	[noise] <unk> maybe because of this bill he's wondering if that was going to change things 
00:15:17	00:15:18	1	effect 
00:15:18	00:15:20	2	<unk> okay maybe i 
00:15:20	00:15:25	1	probably thinking but just not play the memorial for a couple of months to take care of this 
00:15:25	00:15:26	2	yeah maybe 
00:15:28	00:15:30	2	yeah that's right as long as you're 
00:15:30	00:15:31	1	dealing with ball month they're real good about

00:15:39	00:15:42	1	yeah yeah we got injected right before we 
00:15:42	00:15:45	2	and i said that's not right that they should have to pay that

00:22:14	00:22:23	2	the tickets cost a hundred pesos which works out the four dollars okay for a ticket so you tell yourself ten and you get one free so it's forty dollars per booklet

00:22:57	00:22:58	1	oh i don't think it's 
00:22:58	00:23:00	2	i was thinking two things either we could just 
00:23:00	00:23:03	1	send the cash or i could um 
00:23:03	00:23:15	2	use some of the cash money to send a gift and i would buy a gift and then use the remaining cash money you know for the postage right in some something kind of native right from here right now so anyway first prize uh 
00:23:15	00:23:18	1	oh gosh i have it in a letter 
00:23:18	00:23:21	2	it's uh first prize about fifteen thousand dollars

00:23:23	00:23:37	2	and second prize is eight hundred dollars third prizes two hundred dollars and um [noise] the fourth prizes are about between thirty and thirty five dollars apiece okay so that's what it would be okay 
00:23:37	00:23:44	1	so it should i just to adrienne do lakers or just like like i would be able to sell to the family member

00:24:15	00:24:23	2	<unk> i know but this way you can say it's john this is <unk> say this is this is because you don't have to buy magazines from john and you don't have nearby candy 
00:24:23	00:24:25	1	and then i send you the money back 
00:24:41	00:24:46	1	<unk> yeah i would think well yeah but people aren't gonna want to just fill out to stop 
00:24:46	00:24:46	2	mhm

00:27:23	00:27:30	1	even as a bunch of stuff but <unk> the one that moved at all oh yeah i didn't really know how much yeah 
00:27:30	00:27:33	2	well you may get the opportunity to know oh yeah 
00:27:33	00:27:35	1	my dad moved again 
00:27:37	00:27:43	1	watch the tape again before i talked to dad so i will but i was wondering like against that 
00:27:43	00:27:51	2	you know the room that they created the spare bedroom yeah i was wondering if against that back room or something they could build some shelf like larry and bar built in their basement 
00:27:51	00:27:52	1	think so 
00:27:52	00:27:58	2	or like used to be built like we would give that a couple of hundred dollars right to have <unk> 
00:27:58	00:28:07	1	you know build the shelf and then i feel really really selfish about this but i gotta say that those those blonde there's there's 
00:28:13	00:28:15	1	yeah and then a little park bench and 
00:28:15	00:28:17	2	park benches real weak it's about to 
00:28:17	00:28:24	1	break anyway oh buddy i'm blond cheer and adult thing somebody made that force in <unk> and the man is very very old 
00:28:24	00:28:34	2	what's a doll what it's a park bench and a blond cheer and what else uh adult cradle cradle okay yeah [noise] yeah definitely 
00:28:34	00:28:39	1	and you don't want all the kids playing with it right i don't i don't blame ya 
00:28:39	00:28:40	2	well it's just that 
00:28:40	00:28:45	1	the park benches week and and someone would probably wanna toss it out but the man who made it is is that called 
00:28:59	00:29:00	1	i'm serious it's something that 
00:29:00	00:29:02	2	this older man has done 
00:29:02	00:29:05	1	all the kids in well i'm or he does it probably given the church in walmer 
00:29:05	00:29:11	2	so it's just something that we would like the kids to have for a long time so if you could kind of took those away 
00:29:11	00:29:13	1	and i'm sure yeah 
00:29:13	00:29:21	2	and if somebody could build from shelves i just think the stuff wouldn't get rummaged through as much i did did anybody go through the barrel i don't think so 
00:29:21	00:29:22	1	because when you 
00:29:22	00:29:23	2	yeah 
00:29:23	00:29:28	1	you weren't video ain't you said oh and this one used to have clothes and <unk> oh yeah and and this year
