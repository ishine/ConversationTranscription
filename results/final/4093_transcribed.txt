00:17:02	00:17:14	2	yeah that's what i would do is we have i mean it's a different different system here mhm you have to <unk> i would just dial i think it's uh america is country code is one so i think we would die 
00:17:14	00:17:17	1	one and then 
00:17:17	00:17:25	2	i don't know there's there's some code i need to dial on the phone i have no idea what i usually do when i called america has used my a._t. and t cold direct 
00:17:25	00:17:25	1	uh-huh 
00:17:25	00:17:30	2	eighteen to dial direct thing where i call a toll free number in holland and they put me straight through in eighty 
00:17:32	00:17:36	2	and then they build me at american rates which are about a third of the <unk> 
00:17:36	00:17:38	1	yeah 
00:17:38	00:17:42	2	and they built my parents' house and then my parents pay it out of a bank account we have in america 
00:17:43	00:17:44	2	mhm

00:17:46	00:17:48	2	[laughter] 
00:17:48	00:17:55	1	okay but uh yeah it's still it's still fairly fairly expensive call but uh 
00:17:55	00:18:06	2	but it's a lot less expensive if we do it that way then if we if we actually make my my my parents in law pay it and the dutch have such high taxes on those they considered a luxury to call around the world 
00:18:06	00:18:09	1	they tax it really high 
00:18:09	00:18:20	2	anyway um so you guys will be in either the eighteen through the nineties and you're going to go to uh amsterdam when i would say is once you're at a hotel

00:18:27	00:18:38	2	day um that i can meet you in amsterdam and maybe i'll come by public transport it's probably easier for me to come by public transport in amsterdam than it is for me to 
00:18:38	00:18:39	1	come by car to be honest 
00:18:52	00:18:57	2	<unk> and uh since the day is a really long i mean it stays light

00:20:30	00:20:36	1	yeah i didn't i didn't think so somehow i had this feeling that that the military tasted been beaten out of here 
00:20:36	00:20:44	2	[laughter] yeah i'm the <unk> i can't say too bad things about the military though they still have my good and they'll probably hold them hostage 
00:20:44	00:20:46	1	mhm 
00:20:46	00:20:55	2	and they own my body and soul for like another four years so i just got a <unk> thing yeah i <unk> i oh four years inactive reserve

00:21:02	00:21:13	2	who is uh who hasn't been like you were you went through like the thirty six to process mhm so you don't you don't have it but if yeah if you just separate normally and you haven't served at least eight years then you owe it 
00:21:13	00:21:14	1	mhm 
00:21:15	00:21:16	1	and that's one of those things they just 
00:21:16	00:21:18	2	tell you up front 
00:21:18	00:21:24	2	[noise] no they never said anything and i figured there was something like that because 
00:21:24	00:21:27	1	i was in the inactive reserves the entire time i was in college too 
00:21:28	00:21:29	2	so

00:21:40	00:21:41	2	<unk> 
00:21:41	00:21:43	1	but they're going to have to pay my trip back to the states 
00:21:43	00:21:44	2	mhm 
00:21:44	00:21:49	1	'cause there's no basis in harlem that i'm not gonna pay out of my own expensive to go to germany or something for them 
00:21:49	00:21:50	2	mhm 
00:21:50	00:22:01	1	if they want me they can pay bring me back active duty and pay me for the day they're going to drag me off somewhere but uh first they have to find me 
00:22:01	00:22:15	2	yeah that <unk> if you're in another country i mean and you're not planning on coming back to the u._s. what do you what are they going to do even if you don't [noise] yeah well i mean i still american citizen and i still would like to be welcome [laughter] country

00:22:30	00:22:33	2	what's that are you going to try and become a dual citizen 
00:22:33	00:22:36	1	well you can't do you can't do that 
00:22:36	00:22:51	2	the only way to be a dill citizen as if you're born in a foreign country like if i were born in in in holland and then and then had american parents then i could be a dual citizen but you can't if i were to ask to become a citizen in holland i would automatically lose my american citizenship 
00:22:51	00:22:54	1	as far as the americans are concerned yeah 
00:22:54	00:23:05	2	yeah that's could care less the dutch would say find want to be a dill citizen that's fine but the americans as soon as you ask for another citizenship that active asking for it takes away 
00:23:05	00:23:07	1	i can citizenship 
00:23:22	00:23:26	2	yeah but my first seventy five thousand dollars worth of income 
00:23:26	00:23:28	1	tax free 
00:23:28	00:23:31	2	it could long as they don't bring it back to the states 
00:23:31	00:23:34	1	jeeze iris <unk> huh 
00:23:34	00:23:49	2	[laughter] oh they want their share they want their piece of meat but all far in taxes are deductible and my taxes here a fifty percent of income so the taxes here so much higher that yeah i would never have to worry about it 
00:23:49	00:23:51	1	[laughter] 
00:23:51	00:23:55	2	unless you became a c._e._o. of the company then then maybe like 
00:23:55	00:23:57	1	a thousand dollars would be taxable right 
00:23:57	00:24:10	2	yeah some outrageously small amount of the problems is gonna be the problem is going to be ah be on you is american salary is taxable here at fifty percent so we're going to uh some money to the dutch government on her salary 
00:24:10	00:24:11	1	mhm 
00:24:11	00:24:15	2	some amount that has to be deduct at a certain amount and the amount we pay the american guy 
00:24:15	00:24:18	1	i mean there's deductible but people still oh 
00:24:18	00:24:27	2	some taxes i don't know how it works for going to need to have uh some we're gonna do you have some sort of accounting do it because i have no clue how that all 
00:24:27	00:24:30	1	they don't have the quicken dutch version 
00:25:01	00:25:06	1	you'll be you'll be you'll be a student so you i mean you're <unk> what is your income 
00:25:06	00:25:11	2	oh well see i think um it'll probably be about 
00:25:11	00:25:27	1	five thousand dollars for the for the portion next year that i'm in oregon where the fortunate this year that i'm in oregon and then next year it'll be eleven thousand yeah but you'll be below i mean you're below the poverty line that that level so i mean it <unk> 
00:25:27	00:25:33	2	but then i've already made say like fifteen thousand or whatever here in washington but 
00:25:33	00:25:36	1	that should be non taxable out of state income 
00:25:36	00:25:41	2	it should but you know it it just it's not going to be a fun tax return here 
00:25:41	00:25:44	1	[laughter] i had that when i went to the military 
00:25:44	00:25:46	2	[laughter] 
00:25:46	00:25:53	1	can i have to file three tax <unk> georgia kansas and yeah and then my federal

00:26:12	00:26:17	1	and then call you back when um when we get to a hotel or something like that 
00:26:17	00:26:27	2	okay that's a that's a great idea if you as soon as you get into holland and you get yourself settled you can call me and uh if <unk> if it's at night just call on his parents 
00:26:27	00:26:29	1	okay so <unk> 
00:26:29	00:26:38	2	if you dial in holland you need to add a zero so like right now it's it's one at one zero area code if you dial in home that's zero one eight one zero 
00:26:39	00:26:41	1	you know 
00:26:41	00:27:01	2	and and then yeah you can just call up if it's if it's during the work hour's fine call me at work if not call on his parents if you don't have a new phone number for me and if you do all send it by email if i get it before this weekend uh will email you something but if you don't get emails and just calling his parents if we have a phone by then there'll be able to give you the number
