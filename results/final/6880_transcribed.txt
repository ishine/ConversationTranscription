00:05:01	00:05:11	1	of different kinds of art [laughter] you know all the original sculptures and really interesting stuff but she never showed up for any of the things have <unk> 
00:05:11	00:05:16	2	she wasn't there yeah there's a lot at her house and all 
00:05:16	00:05:18	1	well 
00:05:18	00:05:22	2	all her staff was there and there was you know a lot of different 
00:05:29	00:05:36	1	good he um there's like total chaos the u._n. asking my imagine um and um 
00:05:36	00:05:46	2	boss pulled he um this other woman who came in through exams like he did and the other lawyer uh-huh and said i don't know what's gonna happen but there's always going to be job for you 
00:05:46	00:05:48	1	oh that's nice 
00:05:48	00:05:51	2	yeah but they're thinking about getting rid of the entire office 
00:05:51	00:05:52	1	uh-huh 
00:05:52	00:06:12	2	[noise] but in a way but see man has a permit contract and the laws obligated to try to place him somewhere so in a way it might be a good thing for matt yeah if he got sent to new york or something ah would they feel as though there are geared to play some even though the u._s. isn't paying their dues yeah they don't do it like that i know it's not five burn i know 
00:06:12	00:06:23	1	no it's not like that really um about about <unk> yeah and um not just found out actually in friday that he's on the short list for that 
00:06:23	00:06:30	2	<unk> yeah that's nice yeah so i didn't hear that uh he talked well they said 
00:06:30	00:06:32	1	leaving they sit in a kind of 
00:06:32	00:06:41	2	slash serious way um don't call us we'll call you [laughter] and so he's like you know and when was that december 
00:06:41	00:06:47	2	in a while and he <unk> he's not going to call you don't want to be like a knack for it um and they said 
00:06:52	00:06:53	1	[noise] in new york 
00:06:53	00:07:03	2	and and try to find out through there and so then finally he spoke with this woman who knew and say well we just short this together [laughter] 
00:07:03	00:07:11	1	i'm assuming it's like three people i mean that's usually what it is um and you're on it and we have the interview people 
00:07:11	00:07:15	2	the rest of the people off of it so you mean 
00:07:19	00:07:37	2	huh so i mean inside track thing [noise] uh i think what it means is they just screened things that's amazing applications and that happened to be so close that made an interview happened over there what was good for him yeah and now they don't have to find out 
00:07:37	00:07:38	1	or anything right 
00:07:38	00:07:43	2	and i'm sure it's lower this chance to make the short list 
00:07:43	00:07:44	1	yeah i mean i don't know 
00:07:44	00:07:46	2	he does good an interview 
00:07:46	00:07:49	1	so yeah i think i think he did well but you know it's always so hard 
00:07:54	00:08:03	1	well that's nice that's good yeah you're good mhm mhm that's good so even if he doesn't end up getting it he knows he was he's pretty close and the first try yeah 
00:08:06	00:08:07	1	[noise] 
00:08:07	00:08:20	2	um yeah so hopefully and he's been recommended for promotions and um his boss is like really pushing and called an emergency meeting of the promotion board really tried to push he and this other woman 
00:08:20	00:08:22	1	i thought the boss was not like 
00:08:22	00:08:27	2	well he's not but i mean he's tried i think he when he's trying to do is set things up before 
00:08:27	00:08:29	1	oh really oh 
00:08:29	00:08:37	2	and so mass kind of site because i mean things are great oh and they've been told that they have to fire one professional in one secretary

00:08:39	00:08:52	2	but it's not i mean it's not going to be met [noise] but i mean it's still scary you know no kidding yeah and um [noise] ah so he um was gonna say uh anyway he 
00:08:52	00:08:53	1	mhm 
00:09:19	00:09:19	1	right 
00:09:19	00:09:23	2	[noise] in the in the u._n. might be a better place to work after all this stuff 
00:09:23	00:09:24	1	yeah i heard streamlined 
00:09:24	00:09:31	2	yeah [laughter] well i mean it'd be streamline cause it's diplomatic right <unk> i mean 
00:09:31	00:09:33	1	full of redundancy is 
00:09:33	00:09:43	2	right yeah no way around it you really needed to be efficient right <unk> no world war basically right [laughter] 
00:09:43	00:09:45	1	and feed them hungry people 
00:09:45	00:09:47	2	yeah

00:11:02	00:11:04	1	yeah i'm surprised i was 
00:11:04	00:11:13	2	'cause my field and coming up on you know exactly how much money as can scrounge up mhm and so i need to snow the status of the grant yeah and with the government shut down yeah 
00:11:13	00:11:15	1	um uh other 
00:11:15	00:11:26	2	professors <unk> in the mail and everything they're getting from minnesota has generally been coming with the <unk> provides though that due to a government uncertainty and not finalized budget uh it's on unclear when yeah 
00:11:26	00:11:27	1	it'll be review 
00:11:27	00:11:36	2	that sort of thing and so i called them and and they said that march fifteenth was was the contact say whoa i don't hear about 
00:11:36	00:11:38	1	making dissertation grants kind of a priority 
00:11:38	00:11:58	2	that's what i thought and then um my advisor has a grant which was not accepted or put on the weightlifting if money was going to be available mhm and they said they'll let her know by the <unk> sounds as though they they set a goal to clear 
00:11:58	00:11:59	1	yeah 
00:11:59	00:12:01	2	wow that's nice so 
00:12:01	00:12:02	1	yeah one way or another 
00:12:02	00:12:03	2	about the middle of the month 
00:12:03	00:12:07	1	which is good even we don't get it that means i have time to get one

00:14:50	00:14:52	1	no it's not ideal but there are a lot worse places 
00:14:52	00:14:56	2	yeah [laughter] you can do a lot worse than state college
