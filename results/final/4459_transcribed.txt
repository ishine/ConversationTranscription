00:01:25	00:01:26	1	good 
00:01:26	00:01:28	2	yeah and then as time goes by and we're finished

00:01:35	00:01:36	2	mhm 
00:01:36	00:01:38	1	so is is apartment ready 
00:01:38	00:01:47	2	oh because he's he's silly i he could you could have done it already they decided that they'd rather come here and take care of it 
00:01:47	00:01:48	1	okay 
00:01:48	00:01:52	2	they're going to live in a different apartment and still they finish it 
00:01:59	00:02:16	2	maybe she wants to see what other people have done you know she only knows american style she doesn't know israeli styles now yeah i'm sure she's bringing everything with her anyway i i would assume but their apartment that they're putting in that was the one family the crazy people that really did 
00:02:16	00:02:18	1	to the living room normal 
00:02:18	00:02:27	2	and they didn't put in the sliding door they closed it made a window so that lady told you to a while ago that they want the sliding door to the port so badly 
00:02:27	00:02:30	1	uh-huh um and then 
00:02:30	00:02:40	2	they did like from the parent my room to the bathroom they did a door instead of having like we have the my son was there oh no 
00:02:40	00:02:46	1	no so that's nice in a way 'cause you could walk through instead of walking around the whole house to the bathroom 
00:02:46	00:02:48	2	and i get it though 
00:02:48	00:02:51	1	right and then the kitchen though she had to laugh 
00:02:51	00:02:59	2	like the hallway she wanted to leave the hallway 'cause there was an orange but it really made everything smells her kitchen was a maid figures i think they sat down 
00:02:59	00:03:00	1	but other than that 
00:03:00	00:03:05	2	anything else they haven't said yet but how about your house 
00:03:05	00:03:11	1	well we're just about finished we have a few odds and ends to get done but um it's very nice 
00:03:11	00:03:14	2	i can't believe also that you live you live 
00:03:14	00:03:16	1	no in the house well <unk> 
00:03:16	00:03:36	2	beginning was really a lot of fun every day i'd come home and see what they did and it was exciting and and right before we left for pays uh they they broke through so most when we came home than we didn't have a bedroom and the kids were always in their bedroom that it was just us so we just slept downstairs for a few months 
00:03:36	00:03:36	1	mhm 
00:03:40	00:03:41	1	did famous 
00:03:41	00:03:56	2	a couple of things we're still waiting on but basically it's finished everybody's in their room and more carpet painted and yeah so it's you're happy yeah very nice you know there's always little bits and pieces of aggravation but it 
00:03:56	00:03:58	1	nothing can be done 
00:03:58	00:04:05	2	right but it's still very nice very nice so i'm sure mommy told you about we're planning to come to israel

00:04:32	00:04:37	2	so anyway his confidence is i

00:04:38	00:04:47	2	the the week like the twelfth or something i loved that we're so we're probably gonna come anywhere from the seventies to the tense 
00:04:47	00:04:48	1	mhm 
00:04:48	00:04:52	2	[noise] and we'll stay a couple of weeks or i'll stay a couple of weeks i don't know how long 
00:04:52	00:04:54	1	goodness and sit around the time 
00:04:54	00:05:03	2	<unk> is like the second week we would be there so that's that's like on one hand is very nice but on the other hand it's a <unk> years 
00:05:20	00:05:25	1	well it's great it whenever you want to come you can kind of well i just have to say that um i didn't really 
00:05:25	00:05:30	2	tell mommy not because i'm i'm hiding anything i just didn't know exactly how to explain it i have 
00:05:30	00:05:31	1	up in my life 
00:05:38	00:05:46	2	he's giving me a happy size so <unk> it's like he's training me now to the why did it take him so 
00:05:46	00:05:47	1	to give it to you 
00:05:47	00:06:00	2	no for years they asked me a couple of times like they asked me before dog and they asked me once even before you always see a few times and i kept saying no i can't handle it i can't do it really 
00:06:00	00:06:02	1	well also um 
00:06:06	00:06:07	1	why 
00:06:07	00:06:14	2	without him being for it and we saw it a lot impounded i'll tell you why it's a job that's 
00:06:14	00:06:20	1	they do have for a fact of the fact i have a lot of responsibility i told them i used to you want to give me this a thousands and thousands of 
00:06:20	00:06:21	2	<unk> you know 
00:06:29	00:06:30	1	well here with us no matter how 
00:06:30	00:06:32	2	just try or how much wanted food everywhere 
00:06:32	00:06:35	1	everybody complains right 
00:06:35	00:06:42	2	like he says it's a job that no matter what you do nothing is is going to be right it's also hard it's a twenty four hours 
00:06:42	00:06:43	1	seeing on your head 
00:06:43	00:06:48	2	like even though today was just above i waited for about an hour because people were preparing 
00:06:48	00:06:51	1	takes had noted leaving tomorrow 
00:06:59	00:07:01	1	right 
00:07:01	00:07:05	2	okay the bread came today oh sim came today so 
00:07:05	00:07:09	1	think in israel that people would not be working but i guess everybody else is 
00:07:09	00:07:21	2	else says but well <unk> yeah i'm unfortunately not everybody is religious but i think that theoretically you could take it as a choice to say either as a in instead of getting it 
00:07:21	00:07:23	1	oh fifty one is uh 
00:07:23	00:07:25	2	take it off 
00:07:25	00:07:28	1	it's a personal day yeah hey we 
00:07:28	00:07:40	2	he said i mean here we don't nobody works just tore nude here and there any way to make a long story short it was <unk> it would simply a long time to finally decide and then i made a few demand because the truth is that whoever was that can um 
00:07:45	00:08:02	2	they had it easy because i ran the kids just right now no one's there to run the kitchen i said i'm not going to do this without someone you know that's not fair for all the work that i did and even i must admit delve even one pays me a compliment he said it would be easier to finding that can now and then to find some 
00:08:02	00:08:04	1	to replace me 
00:08:04	00:08:13	2	i did the menus and i did this he's we're up will die and i made sure that everything ran and was gone and done and you know and now i have to do all of that and um 
00:08:13	00:08:15	1	well who's gonna do 
00:08:15	00:08:20	2	well so they put you remember my <unk> the argentinian girls powerless 
00:08:33	00:08:35	1	the guy that we have the cook uh-huh 
00:08:35	00:08:46	2	take more responsibility some still doing every night i write them exactly what to do all day long [noise] the only problem is now the girls were <unk> like the in the next week 
00:08:55	00:08:59	2	all the things i want them to do that to have to do the truth is originally 
00:09:15	00:09:17	1	but it didn't work out and 
00:09:17	00:09:19	2	sort of said may be 
00:09:19	00:09:20	1	[noise] now we're back 
00:09:20	00:09:38	2	you know not not another hobby ride and the kids just so we'll have to see but you know it's like i was adamant about it and then i was adamant that i have a good helper the socio economic so now they just die from missouri but not very serious so i'll get 'em out of there and we'll get someone from based on the town 
00:09:38	00:09:43	1	right well if everybody from the keyboards goes off the keyboards he got 
00:09:43	00:09:48	2	go find people the truth is also you know everyone tried to convince me 
00:09:48	00:09:54	1	it's moving up at it's doing other things and it's you know it's a big responsibility and 
00:10:00	00:10:06	1	sleep at night and the truth is even when they would tell you that let's see do you're moving up and so he's 
00:10:22	00:10:28	2	strings or so we'll see how it so hopefully i mean they promised me you know everybody that they're going to help me 
00:10:28	00:10:30	1	whatever i say 
00:10:52	00:10:55	1	because i said i don't know how to turn it on but no i'm not 
00:10:55	00:11:15	2	if i could do it by myself but he's showing me seeing me and i think like the middle of this week he'll be there a few days it's me and then and that he um maybe here and there but he's really basically is what is he going to do he's going to be a teacher for um high school computers 
00:11:15	00:11:16	1	oh okay 
00:11:16	00:11:20	2	yeah so he's only teaching three days a week so he always says it another day 
00:11:20	00:11:23	1	if i made him he'll come in the truth is even teach 
00:11:23	00:11:34	2	and very patient and very good and he also it's great that he has written down everything i'm sure he's thrilled to get out of there well i'll tell you the truth 
00:11:34	00:11:37	1	i mean now that i worked with him one to what 
00:11:37	00:11:42	2	he does do everything was his heart i mean it's not <unk> he's just he has it 
00:11:42	00:11:47	1	some heads and everybody else like i know that he wants everything to be nice to be good and 
00:11:47	00:11:52	2	but he's very stubborn and he'd only he doesn't like to listen to other people's um 
00:11:52	00:11:57	1	ideas but um i'm sure <unk> great 
00:11:57	00:12:00	2	keep us 'cause he was cheap yeah because he's 
00:12:00	00:12:04	1	i'll tell you i worked with him this whole week he doesn't eat a sick ever 
00:12:04	00:12:10	2	like all morning lungs so he doesn't eat he doesn't drink coffee either i didn't see him drinks everything 
00:12:10	00:12:11	1	water or anything 
00:12:11	00:12:18	2	he said i better drink something i have a headache really hot [laughter] but no he doesn't eat anything and then for lunch when we finally went to go 
00:12:18	00:12:23	1	get them and see how we eat like a little 
00:12:23	00:12:25	2	what we would eat maybe 
00:12:25	00:12:29	1	for a meal and that's it so i can understand 
00:12:29	00:12:38	2	now why he thinks that state because he doesn't have big eyes right and that's so funny way no so he had agreed to do it for a year and his years old 
00:12:38	00:12:40	1	are you excited at all about it 
00:12:40	00:12:46	2	well i'll tell you the truth until i made the decision i was scared and also i <unk> i missed the cooking part

00:28:42	00:28:44	1	right that she's happy

00:29:02	00:29:03	1	mhm 
00:29:03	00:29:17	2	of money but we'll see what <unk> what is then who knows it's going to be i don't have my <unk> like if you don't know if they don't have if you don't go to israel there's nothing in camp for after tenth grade
