00:13:21	00:13:25	2	which feed on [laughter] 
00:13:29	00:13:38	2	[noise] yeah it was worth urge people to sit down to talk just so that you're more at our level with them [noise] 
00:13:52	00:13:54	1	oh good 
00:13:55	00:14:00	2	so that and this whole thing originates at the university

00:14:41	00:14:44	1	also um 
00:14:44	00:14:47	2	the years have complete irritation 
00:14:48	00:14:50	2	plead education 
00:14:50	00:14:50	1	yeah 
00:14:51	00:14:53	1	like if you only went for half of it 
00:14:53	00:14:54	2	that doesn't count 
00:14:55	00:14:57	1	no i can't 
00:14:57	00:15:08	2	guess how many years have complete education i've gone and it was on your lives have ever complete yeah some of those years were maybe a little on the sketchy side [laughter] 
00:15:08	00:15:11	1	well i put down seventeen 
00:15:11	00:15:13	2	seems reasonable 
00:15:22	00:15:24	1	because i skipped 
00:15:24	00:15:33	2	half grade yep yep and then uh four years of college uh-huh and then since college i've had several course 
00:15:33	00:15:36	1	yeah that altogether add up to a year 
00:15:36	00:15:51	2	uh so it's not really complete but too close [noise] yeah i just have such a mish mash i'd have to go back and make little calendars to figure it out and i'm not sure i could i don't 
00:15:53	00:16:00	2	yeah i can say okay let's see i took a semester at the university of connecticut and then i did this semester at mcgill in montreal and

00:16:08	00:16:09	1	um 
00:16:09	00:16:20	2	i started doing bits and pieces different places so there was one semester i was going to three different colleges this is monday i must go too [laughter] 
00:16:20	00:16:21	1	yeah 
00:16:21	00:16:24	2	and there was one class that i took that was 
00:16:29	00:16:32	1	it's a credit for it but it was 
00:16:32	00:16:37	2	it was at a time when the community colleges here had more money and it was an english class 
00:16:37	00:16:38	1	that special 
00:16:38	00:16:40	2	in lillian helmet

00:16:45	00:16:46	2	[laughter] it was 
00:16:46	00:16:51	1	but the second half was norman millar and i just wasn't as interested in that so i didn't do it 
00:16:51	00:16:53	2	yeah they had split it into two separate 
00:16:53	00:16:55	1	they could 
00:16:55	00:16:57	2	wanna knock the other 
00:16:58	00:16:59	2	and uh 
00:16:59	00:17:03	2	and then i i took some courses that um al <unk>

00:17:25	00:17:27	2	yes home school

00:17:36	00:17:42	1	when i went to the university oh yeah i forgot about the time i spent it p._c.s at uh flat county which was also

00:18:00	00:18:08	2	well but i take maybe having lived there in the dorm help that didn't uh and that was my primary 
00:18:08	00:18:10	1	great 
00:18:10	00:18:14	2	i have um probably spend 
00:18:14	00:18:21	1	as much time at pasadena as i said at nebraska let's see

00:24:03	00:24:08	1	well you said he had to go in for <unk> yeah and he well he 
00:24:08	00:24:18	2	was it when he first showed up with it he was hospitalized for a week and he said three emergency room visits since then 
00:24:18	00:24:19	1	two in one day 
00:24:19	00:24:21	2	yeah and he's had 
00:24:25	00:24:27	1	using the inhaler 
00:24:27	00:24:29	1	it just doesn't seem like it does 
00:24:29	00:24:42	2	the job it's supposed to do and they put him on two different kinds of inhale um and and then a nasal inhaler or one of those inhaling uh one of the inhaler once it goes in the mouth is 
00:24:42	00:24:43	1	steroids 
00:24:43	00:24:50	2	and the one that goes in his nose causes sneezing fits so there's a possibility that he's allergic to it 
00:24:53	00:24:57	2	and he was just having a horrible time and not able to 
00:24:57	00:24:59	1	really yeah 
00:24:59	00:25:07	2	he'd wake up in a panic three or four times a night because he couldn't breathe uh for two and um 
00:25:07	00:25:10	1	i i knew i had the machine 
00:25:10	00:25:13	2	for giving the breathing treatments 
00:25:13	00:25:16	2	but i didn't know where it was 
00:25:16	00:25:17	1	so as we were getting ready 
00:25:17	00:25:19	2	to go on vacation 
00:25:19	00:25:24	1	i was carrying everything up to pack part in my closet switched some of it had not been 
00:25:25	00:25:36	2	put back together since the earthquake yeah i had some closet damage in the earthquake and i just couldn't face going in there where everything jumbled down on top of each other 
00:25:36	00:25:37	1	to dig through it 
00:25:37	00:25:38	1	anyway i was looking 
00:25:38	00:25:42	2	for stuff for vacation dug through and found the machine 
00:25:42	00:25:46	2	and so i called jenny and i said okay come over here tonight i'm gonna give you a lesson 
00:25:46	00:25:46	1	mhm 
00:25:52	00:25:54	1	[laughter] 
00:25:54	00:26:09	2	he was very familiar with all this this is what they do at the hospital and he knew all about how this works do that anyway so i gave her the little lesson and um the medication that you use and it is the same stuff as what was in one of his inhalers 
00:26:09	00:26:10	1	[noise] and so 
00:26:10	00:26:19	2	i was only sort of practicing medicine without alive [laughter] um and <unk> 
00:26:19	00:26:23	1	the treatment for him which takes about fifteen minutes of of uh 
00:26:23	00:26:29	2	it's like a personal day price er yeah that it it turns the 
00:26:29	00:26:33	2	medication into an inhaler bull vapor and it just puts 
00:26:33	00:26:34	1	through a mask and you just 
00:26:34	00:26:37	2	breathing until it's all gone 
00:26:40	00:26:49	2	about six thirty to say this is the first time he slept through the night in three months oh great and then 
00:26:49	00:26:51	1	apparently that wasn't the one who was lord 
00:26:55	00:26:59	1	the nights that matthew got home they got home late from the air 
00:26:59	00:27:07	2	port and and she didn't do the breathing treatment what i told her to do with every night just before he goes to bed do a breathing treatment 
00:27:07	00:27:14	1	and that night they didn't because they came home late from the airport well he was up three times that night 
00:27:31	00:27:33	1	it's kind of a 
00:27:33	00:27:36	1	ah sophisticated skill i guess 
00:27:36	00:27:39	2	when you're in a panic you can't do it yeah 
00:27:40	00:27:42	2	i talked to her <unk> the next morning 
00:27:42	00:27:46	2	um and by then i was in atlanta but any way i talk to her 
00:27:46	00:27:50	1	and she said that if there was any doubt in her mind 
00:27:50	00:27:54	2	the breathing treatment for what had helps with the problem 
00:27:55	00:27:56	1	that it was 
00:27:56	00:27:57	2	lately removed 
00:27:57	00:28:05	2	you know she had thought oh well maybe he's he's better now he's outgrowing it maybe it's not that there's a problem 
00:28:05	00:28:08	1	that night convinced her that 
00:28:08	00:28:13	2	well <unk> he really does need to do without fail 
00:28:13	00:28:16	1	oh and she said you know it's it's 
00:28:17	00:28:19	2	much better for him 
00:28:19	00:28:21	1	because he has 
00:28:21	00:28:27	2	one medical procedure that takes fifteen minutes and he does at once a day 
00:28:27	00:28:30	1	don't have the <unk> the hospital okay 
00:28:30	00:28:35	2	well he was carrying around two inhalers in a waste pack 
00:28:47	00:28:48	1	uh 
00:28:48	00:28:53	2	a couple of times and an hour when they're supposed to be four hours apart 
00:28:53	00:28:55	1	and 
00:28:55	00:29:06	2	still having lots of these episodes of the panic setting in the heart rate goes up and the breathing changes and bad stuff 
00:29:26	00:29:31	2	she's had to figure out how to explain it to the doctor that uh 
00:29:31	00:29:35	1	thank you for your advice however i took my sister's advice and network better 
00:29:35	00:29:39	2	so [laughter] yeah
