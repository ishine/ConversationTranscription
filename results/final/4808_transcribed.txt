00:06:10	00:06:12	1	oh god 
00:06:12	00:06:17	2	you never know that she was a workaholic and really a very uh very very attractive woman you know

00:06:20	00:06:22	2	well let's see i construction is 
00:06:22	00:06:26	1	oh yeah how's the how's that problem you have with uh no 
00:06:26	00:06:27	2	expensive but it was so 
00:06:27	00:06:29	1	yeah i know you're 
00:06:29	00:06:33	2	very expensive yeah <unk> involving a tremendous amount of money 
00:06:33	00:06:38	1	uh yeah so where you are thinking assuming the person that the <unk> 
00:06:38	00:06:43	2	the cost of sewing and i said my the lawyer seem to think it's not really uh 
00:06:43	00:06:48	1	you know they're just not not not very happy about really oh you're making out with 
00:06:48	00:07:02	2	oh uh my case uh uh he's trying to uh my lawyers trying to get fills lawyer to get together with the lawyer for index futures and see if they can come up with a settlement but so far no he says typically settlements or like when the very 
00:07:02	00:07:03	1	like i say 
00:07:03	00:07:11	2	you know when the uh you're sitting on the steps waiting for the judge and that's when they settle you know but when it when you go into court uh well it it 
00:07:11	00:07:16	1	he thinks it's gonna be postpone originally i was telling you was october sixteenth mhm now he thinks that 
00:07:16	00:07:19	2	more than likely won't be so sometime in the middle of 
00:07:19	00:07:19	1	december 
00:07:19	00:07:27	2	so i try to keep potato [laughter] well ah we're trying to let you know what the data because he he he really would prefer to either have you there otherwise 
00:07:27	00:07:29	1	still videotape you 
00:07:29	00:07:33	2	uh but now he's uh he's thinking it'll probably be delayed 
00:07:33	00:07:33	1	[laughter] 
00:07:33	00:07:39	2	i don't know he is not delayed yet but uh but <unk> but the brokers houses an answering the questions they asked 
00:07:39	00:07:43	1	is he still as confident as evident there'll be some sort of a well he 
00:07:43	00:07:45	2	he's very confident that will win against phil 
00:07:45	00:07:47	1	but he's not sure 
00:07:52	00:07:56	1	britain extra for this particular case he there's no precedent 
00:07:56	00:07:59	2	but <unk> lawyer was probing around and saying well what are you really want 
00:07:59	00:08:01	1	you know so he said 
00:08:01	00:08:06	2	see we don't want to settle with those lawyer prior to settling within their futures 
00:08:18	00:08:18	1	yeah 
00:08:30	00:08:34	1	a few thousand dollars the expert is to say 
00:08:41	00:08:43	1	the thing i really must have ten thousand dollars 
00:08:43	00:08:53	2	well not that much no not so much uh thirty five hundred for him the lawyer and so far and expenses maybe maybe a fifteen hundred so 
00:08:54	00:08:57	2	but the but the big expense would be this ah 
00:08:57	00:09:00	1	<unk> you know 'cause we got to fly him in from chicago probably 
00:09:00	00:09:02	2	what up overnight and pay 
00:09:02	00:09:03	1	how do you find an expert like 
00:09:15	00:09:18	1	chicago ah anyway he said he'll try to 
00:09:18	00:09:23	2	and one and actually want someone who works for a commodities from 
00:09:23	00:09:24	1	and there's 
00:09:24	00:09:33	2	i believe they're all in cahoots together you know i don't <unk> i was just thinking the exact thing that they don't testify against each other but but see they're bringing into experts to say that it's a common 
00:09:33	00:09:36	1	business practice to give those 
00:09:36	00:09:46	2	they admit that they gave fill those internal printouts but they said it's common business practice to give them to substantial customers but on the one hand they're arguing with <unk> 
00:10:08	00:10:10	1	big time she was with the network 
00:10:10	00:10:11	2	she was with n._b._c. 
00:10:11	00:10:15	1	yeah she had gone off the local news on to the uh if you really 
00:10:15	00:10:22	2	yeah and then she uh died she was in a restaurant which we've been to a new hope you know not that far 
00:10:22	00:10:24	1	and uh 
00:10:24	00:10:38	2	it's actually very tricky we we uh when when i heard about the accent i realize that it could easily happen there was a um oh i forget what it was there was a very tricky term when you leave the restaurant and they failed to make that turn out to figure out what <unk> 
00:10:40	00:10:42	2	she died as a result of it you know 
00:10:42	00:10:47	1	but but i remember that too and i said you know i always get get confused when i left that restaurant that uh 
00:10:47	00:10:57	2	could easily make up a a term but anyway um i guess it was her boyfriend that was driving and uh i don't i can't remember the details any more but they that's how she 
00:10:57	00:10:58	1	killed 
00:11:06	00:11:07	1	ten minutes we gotta be 
00:11:07	00:11:12	2	yeah yeah so what else is new ah so are you getting ready for him and he's a fair right 
00:11:12	00:11:13	1	yeah yeah we 
00:11:13	00:11:24	2	saturday and we said we have to like uh we we still didn't make the rather than just what they uh hotel we have to do after we are going to say also yeah other than that let's see what else pearls not too well 
00:11:24	00:11:25	1	oh god isn't that uh 
00:11:25	00:11:28	2	yeah she uh she's not too well 
00:11:28	00:11:35	1	and uh we we spoke to jackie last week um she won a case 
00:11:47	00:11:49	1	i'll be offended but i mean 
00:11:49	00:11:55	2	yeah but any time she got a job so they're only talking about like six weeks worth of checks you know 
00:11:55	00:11:59	1	let me ask you a question does she have hospitalization this new job 
00:11:59	00:12:08	2	yeah but so far they haven't specifically told her what she got she has to pay for part of it which is typical nowadays most companies don't give you a full hospitalization 
00:12:08	00:12:11	1	but we're going to start changing too it's it's getting so 
00:12:11	00:12:20	2	yeah most companies are making the employees pick up uh you know to half of it or whatever and i just finished you know remember i i got a one time job with your upbringing 
00:12:20	00:12:29	1	if they were delaware and that works out real nice i enjoyed every every minute of it and i uh i went up there and turn it over to them ah last thursday 
00:12:29	00:12:34	2	right and then they're going to call in the they're gonna call me in for a review 
00:12:34	00:12:37	1	uh and uh 
00:12:37	00:12:45	2	that's how the review goes i don't know who's going to be there to go over with me they say typically they make you redo some of it you know or whatever they make you spend more time 
00:12:45	00:12:47	1	but that was no 
00:12:47	00:12:50	2	oh nice i enjoyed it and and it was <unk> 
00:12:50	00:12:51	1	yeah 
00:12:51	00:12:59	2	i haven't received a money but i you know i think uh i think uh um i don't have any fears but oh that's great that's that's if you get a few 
00:12:59	00:13:03	1	yeah oh jeeze where'd you work do it at home 
00:13:07	00:13:16	1	it was mostly uh just my thoughts getting what thoughts that it was something i had done before it m._c._i. and western union and my friends um 
00:13:16	00:13:20	2	that's what they wanted and uh so i you know it's something i felt very comfortable with 
00:13:26	00:13:35	2	and i i write up the specification i grew up uh oh about thirty four pages of very detailed flow charts which isn't exactly what he wanted a bit [laughter] 
00:13:35	00:13:36	1	like old fashioned 
00:13:36	00:13:43	2	but the guy um the guy but i <unk> <unk> turns it over too he just had me spend an afternoon explaining it to them 
00:13:43	00:13:44	1	and they didn't seem 
00:13:44	00:13:49	2	to the way i did it and my friend said he's the fanciest guy i'd have to worry about 
00:13:49	00:13:50	1	and he seemed okay 
00:13:50	00:13:57	2	so now it's um just a few other managers they are they're gonna you know get together probably hung me back again and explain it again 
00:13:57	00:13:59	1	tell me what's happened to gary 
00:13:59	00:14:10	2	oh well we're real hopefully tomorrow we probably will find out more he has to potential jobs potential to teaching jobs one is um lessons on us 
00:14:10	00:14:13	1	which we're not too happy about 'cause it's black and it's very rough 
00:14:15	00:14:17	1	called him back 
00:14:17	00:14:30	2	for a second interview and they said it was narrowed down to four people <unk> well so he has a one out of four chance i guess but uh the town is all black you know near atlantic city and it's what now 
00:14:36	00:14:41	1	so uh it would be nice for him to get the experience you know he wouldn't 
00:14:41	00:14:44	2	certainly live there but i on the other hand might not be great experience 
00:14:44	00:14:47	1	the other one is that it's in new jersey but they 
00:14:47	00:14:55	2	what we don't like about that is that's a nicer area probably but uh and it's only a couple of hours from here he'd have to relocate either way 
00:15:04	00:15:06	1	one teacher they have and 
00:15:06	00:15:15	2	they're not able to get rid of that teacher he would be more of a long term sub or produce them so i changed the story from the first times of the second time 
00:15:15	00:15:17	1	anyway he supposed to hear from books 
00:15:17	00:15:22	2	cause i'm tomorrow and uh if he gets the i think 
00:15:33	00:15:39	1	see if he if you can survive the principal job it's certainly a great uh on your 
00:15:58	00:16:00	2	not as bad as the big city black areas 
00:16:00	00:16:02	1	you're not going to live in 
00:16:02	00:16:11	2	no no he lives you know live somewhere nearby you know maybe in a harbor or uh you know or could be we did we drive to go driving down to atlanta 
00:16:11	00:16:17	1	yeah well you take the black horse pike you're passing right through pleasant though i think we were 
00:16:17	00:16:27	2	yeah you probably pass through it from the road you can't tell anything you know you see a bunch of bird burger kings and things like that but the community itself i think has become pretty much play 
00:16:27	00:16:29	1	well probably know what i'm saying 
00:16:29	00:16:41	2	hi my name is <unk> really terrible and then uh the other thing is uh uh well innocent and i think it would be a nicer community ah we don't know much about it but uh 
00:16:41	00:16:46	1	but it it's all gonna be last minute that they hire 'em they're going to win i'm like right away so 
00:16:46	00:16:49	2	on the verge of they're gonna want them now or are these 
00:16:49	00:16:55	1	you know writing it right away they were talking about this it's <unk> like a last minute thing at both places 
00:16:55	00:17:02	2	uh they're they're the <unk> the kids just went back to school or going back to school tomorrow and he's supposed to find out tomorrow 
00:17:02	00:17:03	1	what are we talking about 
00:17:03	00:17:16	2	right but that's when they want 'em for like right away you know so ah so i don't know i don't know why this won't happen last minute but that's where they both need 'em for like they they're short a teacher i guess or something 
00:17:16	00:17:19	1	[noise] somebody <unk> with working 
00:17:19	00:17:24	2	yeah well <unk> like doing some jobs on his own soon yeah 
00:17:24	00:17:26	1	pretty rough money well he's been pretty busy i 
00:17:26	00:17:30	2	really don't have any idea what kind of money he's <unk> he's getting but 
00:17:30	00:17:32	1	he's been fairly busy but you know it's
