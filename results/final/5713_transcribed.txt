00:01:11	00:01:20	2	they were so i think a one sentence mentioned i don't think they ran the whole story 'cause they just run the was not a feature story i think like a one paragraph mention of something 
00:01:20	00:01:21	1	to pay 
00:01:21	00:01:23	2	yeah no definitely not i would have seen that no

00:01:25	00:01:28	2	yeah 'cause the international this and just run some things and 
00:01:28	00:01:30	1	you're probably taking notes on called 
00:01:30	00:01:43	2	cool it's sort of an <unk> and they said like the really work they've had a conference and top and they're doing stuff together no apparently miriam was invited to go to a meeting of theirs and mid december where she also will have to give a hand there or something it's just 
00:01:43	00:01:50	1	that sounds kind of neat which could be neat but she's not sure whether you know depends where they still have another real job and then <unk> with a woman 
00:01:50	00:01:59	2	no i know there's some mentioned in the jerusalem post or juice and report last week that egypt israel an cypress are doing a joint training exercise and <unk> i guess 
00:01:59	00:02:00	1	mm that i haven't heard of that 
00:02:06	00:02:08	1	<unk> pardon 
00:02:08	00:02:20	2	other articles pretty interesting i'm in sort of thing you know basically we're the palestinians and their problems are pretty basic just like you know decent drinking water and how is very important to coordinate things i was like just like dumping you know uh 
00:02:20	00:02:29	1	you know chemical wasted one country finds you know a thousand dollars and the other one science fifty thousands obviously ball and then they get together and dumping the cheap 
00:02:29	00:02:36	2	yeah for sure where <unk> <unk> what happened to ever see another copy of it maybe mail at my direction okay i'll try it again 
00:02:36	00:02:38	1	i may even have a lying on the hospital 
00:02:38	00:02:41	2	pretty shy and threw it out mhm 
00:02:41	00:02:43	1	you sound tired <unk> almost <unk> 
00:02:43	00:02:48	2	no no no i'm okay with it in the <unk> before i think it 
00:02:48	00:03:01	1	i wasn't sure okay yeah yeah it's hard to explain to her i can't talk to her she <unk> she was offended well no i think she well actually we had this little it maybe she really because i remember we had on the phone calls before and she also was a little bit upset why isn't he 
00:03:01	00:03:07	2	i said it's a special phone calling only talk to your mommy she goes okay yeah and i'm like well whatever yeah 
00:03:07	00:03:09	1	how are they how you doing 
00:03:09	00:03:26	2	there right now it's like walking around in the snow flurries but i guess i have to finish winter rising the stuff they can get some water 'cause the water's gonna freeze up one day without water will be fine but i just getting bigger oh they're they're big matter of fact uh <unk> about the kids out here in <unk> the littlest one i guess 
00:03:26	00:03:27	1	uh show huh 
00:03:27	00:03:34	2	so <unk> they don't really like to say hey do you mean you're almost they almost twice the size of the chase him all around the u. penn it's pretty funny 
00:03:34	00:03:35	1	oh my god 
00:03:35	00:03:48	2	chase right after he turns it stops i look at them like we're not chasing as soon as he walks they run right in back of 'em [laughter] it's funny but they're going to video or am i guess doing it um i was oh i know what i want to ask you is that they <unk> just now 
00:03:48	00:03:56	1	yeah you mentioned that yeah anyway we've ah i had to be honest i haven't seen them yet i <unk> i think they've got eight or something like that but anyway the girl 
00:03:56	00:04:01	2	working with him he said if you could send her some sort of information about <unk> 
00:04:01	00:04:02	1	definitely 
00:04:02	00:04:03	2	pleased to get anything you've got 
00:04:03	00:04:06	1	definitely you know they they were 
00:04:06	00:04:10	2	checking things out here a little bit about <unk> apparently there's no um 
00:04:12	00:04:19	2	raising of the countries at one of the problem is they can't uh there's a problem slaughtering them now that seems weird 'cause i can't imagine that would ever play slaughter 
00:04:19	00:04:21	1	[laughter] 
00:04:21	00:04:34	2	that's the problem here too in the united states is the slaughtering of them yeah they need the u._s. the primary culture as leery setting up a lie fuck industry then giving pressured by government agencies i mean there are places but it seems not so much it's hard to do 
00:04:34	00:04:36	1	but i'll just like they need to be class 
00:04:36	00:04:43	2	livestock first they're going for human consumption no but why wouldn't they both misled you get it was the officers are being slaughtered i would think that 
00:04:43	00:04:48	1	you know like all kinds of stuff like a male or just how do you speak english tour 
00:04:48	00:04:53	2	oh you can still smell english stuff i'm okay yeah yeah oh you can just mail it to me than 
00:04:53	00:04:58	1	okay i'll definitely mental mental one of my email magazines as well okay yeah 
00:04:58	00:05:04	2	and um well tell me what ever was the end with electricity in your house pardon what was the problem 
00:05:04	00:05:13	1	thing basically vibrate uh uh uh what's called a dead short oh wire came loose on a main ground line inside in the whole system just shut down with just normal 
00:05:13	00:05:15	2	where was the wire 
00:05:15	00:05:17	1	up in the ad across base very hard to get too 
00:05:17	00:05:21	2	you mean like maybe just even reverberations from the <unk> 
00:05:21	00:05:35	1	i think he just you know just happened to happen right to an unrelated to current search that is very unusual thing to happen and you know as it was it was no fire hazard from because it ground them to write out but you know no one took him for it you know he did not find that then then we came back to columbus for hours to locate finally where 
00:05:35	00:05:36	2	wow 
00:05:36	00:05:39	1	but anyway we place then a couple of other circuits on it 
00:05:39	00:05:39	2	uh-huh 
00:05:39	00:05:47	1	change the few things in the wiring too but as i said it's just a weird thing where it actually disconnected very poorly put on it wasn't really fast and the proper way 
00:05:47	00:05:48	2	yeah how much you have to pay for it 
00:05:48	00:05:53	1	a hundred and twenty which is very reasonable mhm do you spend a mask hunting parts too that's way way below normal right 
00:05:53	00:06:08	2	right and he's going to help me do a few things and the buying the snow is like so studying i can hardly see <unk> wasn't amount of forecasting had a chance of flurries is like an inch and a half a flurries underground flowers are still up which is really pretty up the photograph it tomorrow 
00:06:08	00:06:10	1	mm mm 
00:06:27	00:06:28	1	there's nothing to probably came and stole 
00:06:28	00:06:38	2	yeah yeah but they know i mean how to find out how to bring it up and the games they finish or like still there for them to continue working with mhm but i have no idea how they do it actually i don't care because i don't know 
00:06:42	00:06:44	2	who the two boys uh-huh yeah 
00:06:44	00:06:47	1	have they come up more than a couple of times <unk> 
00:06:47	00:07:01	2	free time well the whole family i think twice together in every step by a couple of times with ah one of the kids and friends of uh blanking on his name's abby obvious friends because if he was really friends and 
00:07:10	00:07:11	1	not l. e. 
00:07:16	00:07:18	2	oh is he <unk> 
00:07:21	00:07:22	2	i think that might be who it is 
00:07:31	00:07:35	1	cause they were here's your here's your life with it for ten minutes passing through real quickly 
00:07:35	00:07:49	2	yes that's possibly came to <unk> and yeah and let's see nothing else much of a figure but i use it the phone call here you know or runs out now i think what else can columns are progressing <unk> some of my columns again soon 
00:07:49	00:07:50	1	uh-huh 
00:08:14	00:08:22	2	i'm not sure yeah by the way we even have u._p._s. now but that probably is expensive i don't know what caused u._p._s. overseas 
00:08:22	00:08:28	1	the expensive yeah yeah it's funny this phone connection is not the greatest kind of us it's spaces a space between 
00:08:28	00:08:30	2	yeah and i hear a little bit of noise in the <unk> 
00:08:30	00:08:33	1	maybe it's just the stormy i'm sorry it's quite it's quite a snow storm coming down 
00:08:33	00:08:39	2	that's what i miss hello [laughter] hi how are the <unk> or the chicken still giving their er 
00:08:39	00:08:43	1	yeah they're <unk> well i was getting almost an egg a day five eight 
00:08:43	00:08:52	2	eight eight hands i got rid of all the roosters but one and now they're laying about two weeks early slowed way down to get like maybe three eggs out of all of them every day which is fine you know 
00:08:52	00:09:00	1	oh did they total total uh-huh be if i put a light into them artificial light they'll pick way up but it's only in the wiring all done i don't want to do that 
00:09:00	00:09:02	2	mhm oh the ethic doing 
00:09:02	00:09:09	1	loves the first day out in the weather just run around all playful like almost playful with the dog and they go a walk together now 
00:09:09	00:09:19	2	oh really gotta walk the walk sat beside kind of ignored each other but if either one stocks the other one will wait until they kind of enjoy to this company but don't really hang out once in a while as technical buttons 
00:09:19	00:09:21	1	first doesn't like probably be playful 
00:09:21	00:09:22	2	um 
00:09:22	00:09:31	1	i forgot there was a while back no we was starting to <unk> decides she wants a labrador retriever golden retriever and she tried working on so there was no 
00:09:31	00:09:44	2	was no chance but maybe should check with the next door neighbors didn't work and then you decide well in that case then she's going to go to america to live with uncle johnny golf and and either <unk> die pretty soon it's natural kill for it 
00:09:44	00:09:47	1	and then johnny will buy a labrador retriever for her 
00:09:47	00:09:54	2	and then he'll buyer anything she possibly wants and also then she'll find a find a nice girl for him to marry 
00:09:54	00:10:02	1	okay trailer everywhere you know that if you find if you if you find johnny nice to go to marry then maybe johnny won't be able to buy you anything you want 
00:10:02	00:10:20	2	hotels is tolerable <unk> actually the vet the vet your spirits about a year [laughter] yeah you know he's healthy buddies at times he just totally <unk> i <unk> i really think he almost like <unk> like dogs all farmers seems real confused about walking you stopped looks around and like what am i doing here you know 
00:10:20	00:10:24	1	and it's hearing is not an <unk> is is very very bad hearing about real quickly 
00:10:24	00:10:26	2	well it's interesting that he had to go to sort of you know 
00:10:26	00:10:32	1	yeah oh it's comical you you can tell her tell her fits are probably die real soon so she can come to america 
00:10:32	00:10:35	2	okay and then mom

00:11:30	00:11:34	2	yeah yeah oh yeah 
00:11:34	00:11:37	1	you don't have any plans yet for <unk> 
00:11:37	00:11:44	2	and now i mean i'd like to have a definite plan you know things are probably pick up faster we ever get our fire department contract settled 
00:11:44	00:11:47	1	i've got like five thousand dollars back they don't have some money to afford to go 
00:11:47	00:11:50	2	uh-huh yeah i got in trouble

00:12:06	00:12:10	1	yeah i've got another copy the leadership it's kind of pretty interesting it's all through israel 
00:12:17	00:12:21	2	i i yeah i think some place i saw an article for that maybe even the jerusalem report 
00:12:21	00:12:22	1	kind of <unk> 
00:12:22	00:12:36	2	yeah yeah yeah i thought it was something you'd like [laughter] oh i see what else that's why i was going to practice my hebrew i can't do that on the phone for this phone call 
00:12:36	00:12:41	1	we're maybe tomorrow we're probably going to be going to the area near <unk> and um 
00:12:41	00:12:43	2	having a 
00:12:43	00:12:48	1	i was sort of an olive picking i'll <unk> i'll sometimes an olive festival 
00:12:48	00:12:53	2	<unk> bunch of arab villages there and a couple of small jewish villages 
00:12:53	00:12:55	1	i guess the end of the olive picking time and there's just 
00:12:55	00:12:57	2	be tours of these 
00:12:57	00:13:02	1	places where they make the olive oil and it sounds like it could be pretty interesting and maybe some folks 
00:13:08	00:13:11	2	mhm but then it fell through because they've been dark your goal coming there for the weekend 
00:13:11	00:13:14	1	how's it doing a little better 
00:13:14	00:13:21	2	seeing them yet because each time i've tried like twenty something i've tried to get down there each time sort of <unk> kind of well you know you know 
00:13:21	00:13:23	1	i guess you hesitant about people come to visit 
00:13:23	00:13:37	2	mhm they'll marry him did see was they're selling them for a couple of hours she was in jerusalem and she said you can see it's not always the same because sometimes once again she was talking to him and he was going over mapping pointing things out to her which to her seemed like they were 
00:13:37	00:13:41	1	off and a little while later we're talking all the instructions 
00:13:41	00:13:57	2	fine mhm you just speak it a little bit slower but you can still you know you can understand them which is probably how it's going to stay in the you know i don't <unk> and this is getting better but yeah i'm sure he's never going to drive again or anything like that even though they won't admit it yeah 
00:13:57	00:13:57	1	mhm 
00:14:10	00:14:16	1	a bunch of interviews already <unk> slim and she's gonna be gone for some interviews and <unk> 
00:14:16	00:14:21	2	hey what's up with the snow i know i keep it in the snow and so pretty watching and come down 
00:14:21	00:14:21	1	do you still coming 
00:14:21	00:14:27	2	uh hunting season's on so i really they're here but i know most never see 'em they don't really see their face value 
00:14:27	00:14:32	1	i think well actually i think you're sitting right on my <unk> they don't come out there you just stay inactive all day some on at night 
00:14:32	00:14:33	2	mhm 
00:14:33	00:14:40	1	seen a couple of times i've started to d._r. barely beyond my tree line you know so they just lay low into budge yes <unk> 
00:14:40	00:14:52	2	i think <unk> i won't say being friendly as a four point buckets hanging out which i know up north for it because when i'm all for it to but we started with the <unk> kind of looks and walks away doesn't run so i guess you know sports is pretty much you know no problem 
00:14:52	00:14:54	1	yeah 
00:14:54	00:15:03	2	in some ways probably he's glad for instance around 'cause they suspect you know the <unk> around nothing else was around and kind of senses everything's okay i'm sure that you can smell for it's 
00:15:03	00:15:05	1	mhm 
00:15:05	00:15:09	2	um what do you know this have you ever heard this computer game called <unk> 
00:15:09	00:15:12	1	yeah i have some real <unk> supposed to get it 
00:15:12	00:15:26	2	yeah i i bought that free lawyer for his birthday i bought it when i was in the states and he was uh he was working on it i mean he's been working out and stole it actually two different it runs up a c._d. and installed at both of nurse father's computer and also at one of his 
00:15:26	00:15:30	1	friends' computers and it was one there was some numbers 
00:15:30	00:15:40	2	sort of a puzzle type thing which they work on for quite a while and like adopt a daughter and her friend were working at it now and they just they just solved the riddle for him i don't know you get what they are 
00:15:40	00:15:41	1	but uh 
00:15:41	00:15:46	2	some sort of things turning <unk> it's it's amazing graphics and three d. and stuff 
00:15:46	00:15:48	1	yeah well that's what all the 
00:15:48	00:15:53	2	average kids want me wants to all these things so they can use the computer all the time which is why not um 
00:15:53	00:15:56	1	yeah they don't have a computer no 
00:15:56	00:15:57	2	nope

00:16:11	00:16:14	1	oh definitely yeah i know i think you're enjoying the school 
00:16:14	00:16:20	2	system i guess there's a little more stimulation of the school systems here there is he or a guy that's my impression i'm getting yeah mhm 
00:16:20	00:16:22	1	oh now i told you you heard of a little bit 
00:16:22	00:16:28	2	the history of the house there earlier rental yeah anyway did you hear about that it was on national television their house

00:17:31	00:17:33	2	it was a white area nation you know 
00:17:33	00:17:39	1	like you know pretty good <unk> type thing there which is real obvious from inside we see the house 'cause you can see exactly where the shells 
00:17:39	00:17:41	2	'cause they just got my spell the shelves in the kitchen 
00:17:41	00:17:42	1	i thought you were there yeah 
00:17:43	00:17:49	1	but as a picture of the lady breastfeeding her baby sitting right all kind of in a little chair in the kitchen right by the shelf area 
00:17:49	00:17:52	2	amazing yeah 
00:17:52	00:17:55	1	but it was amazing seeing it on on national television 
00:17:55	00:18:00	2	mhm they don't show the street name but they do show the address which is you know there's 
00:18:00	00:18:01	1	you can't identify with them 
00:18:01	00:18:15	2	no no that clear as day that's what everyone for for whatever it is you know mhm mhm so that should probably coming a week or so yeah that'll mommy said that she'd postpone to visit you for a couple times just serve assorted reasons i mean their health their parents 
00:18:23	00:18:24	1	what was that 
00:18:32	00:18:36	1	she says she doesn't know you but to say hi bruce lee he my adopted ukrainian 
00:18:36	00:18:43	2	tell her i spend every day and night screaming to meet her yeah she's out the door 
00:18:43	00:18:45	1	so as soon as again what um 
00:18:45	00:18:50	2	uh henry woke up with you know i guess feeling that hit some kind of pain and his arm mhm so you end up going 
00:18:50	00:18:55	1	to uh they called the doctor at home and said no don't you know don't like going on in the hospitals they went to the 
00:18:55	00:18:56	2	mhm and i guess 
00:18:56	00:19:02	1	kept them for twenty four hours just to <unk> upon absolutely nothing i mean not a thing mhm which 
00:19:02	00:19:15	2	you know something very insignificant like a a mini <unk> my i guess if it was something medical be it's called the c._i._a. or <unk> <unk> attack like a mini mini mini stroke which is actually fairly common people don't know if they have one often 
00:19:15	00:19:17	1	either that or or was nothing 
00:19:17	00:19:19	2	oh if you're on this subject already 
00:19:19	00:19:21	1	um 
00:19:21	00:19:33	2	i told you i mean i think i told that when i was a state that i had to lose all these headaches and stuff you all have this and they said they found like a sister or something they are just there was nothing well about a couple of weeks ago i had a point 
00:19:33	00:19:36	1	the uh assistant 
00:19:36	00:19:43	2	she for the department of the newer surgery department <unk> and hospitals when the big tell these hospitals mhm and i took all my c._d.'s and the letter all 
00:19:43	00:19:44	1	though 
00:19:44	00:19:51	2	he looked at it and he also said he says he thinks i had a very mild very very mild stroke <unk> and that is not a <unk> 
00:19:55	00:19:59	2	i haven't that's the call in states isn't also 
00:19:59	00:20:01	1	<unk> yeah 
00:20:01	00:20:19	2	yeah which apparently is i think the one of the <unk> pretty much the top of the top of the tests that can be done i think the main thing is when you're like five thousand dollars or something like that but you know i don't feel it's paid for by the health insurance you know he's not positive but that's what he looks as if it's like swelling around uh um blood vessels something they're not 
00:20:19	00:20:21	1	mhm 
00:20:21	00:20:23	2	no i haven't seen anything to moms that don't really 
00:20:23	00:20:25	1	i know she'd be all concerned yeah 
00:20:25	00:20:33	2	and i'm waiting for that and i'm not you know he didn't seem horribly worried 'cause then it gets like he didn't tell me to do anything 
00:20:33	00:20:37	1	different in the way of doing anything until you know you know or the test and we'll see 
00:20:37	00:20:44	2	well throw it turned on t. i. to him he'll not feeling very well pardon i'm sure i mean maybe that's a <unk> 
00:20:44	00:20:48	1	that might be the term is using just didn't use that term 'cause he might consider too technical just go on 
00:20:48	00:20:55	2	to use and i didn't know what i said what's that you know i didn't <unk> i had no idea what he was using that maybe was even one of them 
00:20:55	00:21:01	1	'cause they're also saying now sometimes with their thinking is cause like mysterious plane crashes and stuff on people under pressure is having 
00:21:01	00:21:08	2	a pilot having a school it's a t._a. has a momentary many stroke but for the three seconds he's kind of out of it 
00:21:08	00:21:11	1	what do you find a <unk> a fighter pilots six hundred miles an hour that's a major 
00:21:11	00:21:14	2	um yeah for a three second loss of 
00:21:14	00:21:15	1	<unk> 
00:21:15	00:21:28	2	what was it was a pattern you know of a few months of you know very bad headaches and dizziness and occasionally i was to lose my balance a bit and then sort of slowly but surely it hasn't been a hundred percent i mean built the headaches or gone except for you know here in their normal headaches 
00:21:28	00:21:29	1	mhm but i 
00:21:29	00:21:31	2	occasionally have a bit of disease 
00:21:31	00:21:32	1	<unk> mhm 
00:21:32	00:21:38	2	so i don't know we'll see and i just you know even with the i'm a little bit nervous about this new job but i <unk> i'm not 
00:21:38	00:21:41	1	mentioned it i would have mentioned at all to see what you know 
00:21:41	00:21:50	2	mhm it'll happen it'll happen something and not you know i i can't put my life on standby maybe i've got some thinking maybe it will cause a problem you know 'cause i mean he didn't 
00:21:50	00:21:56	1	seem you know basically he said well look at you know we're young girl let's take care of you and they used doesn't want to do more tests and make sure 
00:21:56	00:22:03	2	i think you said if i had had two seats he's done they can be done both within without i think i'd nine or something and 
00:22:03	00:22:07	1	and if they both been done he said you can do better comparisons by looking at them 
00:22:07	00:22:09	2	but they only did one by 
00:22:09	00:22:11	1	mhm so we said 
00:22:11	00:22:25	2	couldn't really you know be sure and i guess thing is is going to order a new test anyway he figured it might as well or the m._r._i. which is even a better a better test some weight i maybe i'll give them a call next week i'm they're supposed to call me when my appointment is by maybe we'll call them and ask them 
00:22:25	00:22:29	1	mhm <unk> but i you know when he's 
00:22:29	00:22:32	2	the word and he <unk> <unk> in hebrew you say you wore which literally isn't it 
00:22:32	00:22:38	1	an event you know he said you had to you know i think you may be had uh you know a very small events mhm 
00:22:54	00:23:08	2	you know you could say it was interesting with the city you could see there was two layers one way or we could see a rather large black area and the second <unk> another layer the next that we could see just a little bit of it where it was sort of getting smaller have you looked at sea 
00:23:08	00:23:12	1	oh yeah they're pretty neat little you always like detailed y'all usually yeah 
00:23:12	00:23:21	2	yeah no i don't know what the m._r._i. looks like if it looks the same or different er you know whatever i'm not sure i'm not quite sure what the differences between the two of them 
00:23:21	00:23:27	1	but uh i'm in <unk> there was a little miriam mentioned a bit of something this is just there and i haven't gotten to 
00:23:27	00:23:30	2	okay i won't mention any of your mom but i think it's 
00:23:30	00:23:31	1	and getting mommy uh 
00:23:31	00:23:46	2	'cause you mentioned that you were worried because what headaches or something you know well yeah that was <unk> and i've been i've been i think it was him before i went to the states i seen the neurologist and carriage month she pretty much just said it's you know it's it's in my head and you know i was you know just 
00:23:46	00:23:48	1	bad mood tension whatever 
00:23:48	00:24:01	2	and you know it'll go away and now it's and i was extremely tense you know bad sort of mood and the spring as possible something that that also could even bring a little stroke on affirmative stream the extremely tents and upset all the time 
00:24:01	00:24:01	1	mhm 
00:24:01	00:24:03	2	i'm a i think that that 
00:24:03	00:24:05	1	and does when people you know sort of 
00:24:05	00:24:11	2	overwork ten <unk> so i don't know when we know what what will be in the end but we'll see 
00:24:11	00:24:17	1	is it blood thinner called <unk> t. p. a. or something my prescribe of they were concerned and think what it's called 
00:24:17	00:24:23	2	yeah so we'll see him he didn't seem to see any <unk> any reason to to describe anything until we have the rest of the 
00:24:23	00:24:26	1	uh-huh so 
00:24:26	00:24:28	2	it was just thinking actually is 
00:24:28	00:24:31	1	i know i have this i didn't even mentioned this to 
00:24:31	00:24:42	2	i only thought of it later i've got this problem where i rules you know i get black and blue very very easily and i remember i was once tested at the hospital on them 
00:24:42	00:24:47	1	and they said that i have sort of a borderline problem with like was it <unk> sites or something 
00:24:47	00:24:51	2	<unk> i'm not sure what i know what you mean 
00:24:51	00:24:52	1	about the blood 
00:24:52	00:25:03	2	<unk> i guess where it said you know it's it's borderline that fly bruise so easily but you know it's not dangerous but that's just why it happens that from just the slightest little 
00:25:03	00:25:04	1	mhm 
00:25:04	00:25:08	2	nah i get very big black and blue martin and i'm trying to think how this 
00:25:08	00:25:10	1	<unk> if this would be 
00:25:10	00:25:13	2	the same direction as a stroke or the other direction if i'm not sure 
00:25:13	00:25:16	1	even related you know let me guess that'd be guessing there 
00:25:24	00:25:28	1	think of it before did they take blood samples when you're there 
00:25:28	00:25:30	2	no he at the time you just 
00:25:30	00:25:31	1	<unk> okay you probably will not 
00:25:31	00:25:37	2	um i've had well actually they did a lot of blood tests before and i think they were written down the letter 
00:25:37	00:25:44	1	that they sent the kibbutz it ordered pretty <unk> you know they were obviously looking also the possibility of cancer or whatever you know the <unk> 
00:25:44	00:25:45	2	mhm 
00:25:45	00:25:46	1	they did pretty thorough 
00:25:46	00:25:47	2	mhm 
00:25:47	00:25:51	1	blood blood work i'm thinking you know blood work i had my eyes tested 
00:25:51	00:25:59	2	[noise] let's see i had the c. t. done a hat and e._k._g. <unk> no not e._k._g. eat eat cheese and i think 
00:25:59	00:26:00	1	yeah <unk> 
00:26:09	00:26:10	1	i think that's about it 
00:26:10	00:26:18	2	<unk> pretty thorough death mhm yeah i'm surprised this is i'm sure i thought this half an hour is the gum already 
00:26:18	00:26:21	1	the corner this a few minutes let them run across to warn you yeah 
00:26:21	00:26:26	2	they do i never was there and they warn you and you've got about one minute left to go round yeah 
00:26:26	00:26:30	1	when they warn you the neat deal <unk> <unk> 
00:26:30	00:26:31	2	<unk> yeah 
00:26:31	00:26:34	1	i mean she can't do one for grandma and grandpa henry 
00:26:34	00:26:41	2	probably not or else you could use a different name for him yeah i can't believe windows i win is absolutely howling outside 
00:26:41	00:26:46	1	yeah no here it's pretty 
00:26:46	00:26:55	2	nice weather not not real hot or anything <unk> starting with the rain i'm curious to see how what sort of a winter it'll be it'll be a nice 
00:26:55	00:26:57	1	oh nice winter no mhm 
00:26:57	00:27:01	2	mhm mhm what else 
00:27:01	00:27:02	1	we will actually 
00:27:02	00:27:26	2	we'll probably be seeing a they've into nuts vietnam about a month from now because of never got an invitation to a thirty year reunion to his um army unit from one he he was in his basic training and it's being held at a <unk> that's like twenty minutes from davidson on friday night so we'll probably go there davis insidious first you know leave the kids they go to the party and then go back and spend the night day was vietnam 
00:27:26	00:27:38	1	all they saturday and that sort of came out nicely 'cause i think otherwise they're probably would've wouldn't bother to go even though <unk> last earning that had a he was the only one that didn't show up [laughter] it's not nice 
00:27:38	00:27:47	2	ever go to these things you get the reunion every year for the group no not at all there was some sort of reunion about a year to go i don't even remember if it was exactly from the same 
00:27:47	00:27:48	1	<unk> mhm 
00:27:48	00:28:06	2	mm maybe not even <unk> i <unk> i don't remember exactly what <unk> what was the other one but there was some other something every so often every few years they have some sort of a reunion but some of them were not necessarily the reserve group somewhere i'm somewhere in the basic training grew but some of the first reserve group is even and there were different you know even though a lot of the people at the 
00:28:06	00:28:14	1	people yeah but they're not exactly the identical uh done a good thing but this one was thirty years from when they enlist in the army
