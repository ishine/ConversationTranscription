00:00:43	00:00:44	2	mhm 
00:00:44	00:00:50	2	you say you got <unk> alright no say they got in for <unk> 
00:00:50	00:00:53	1	as best case scenario just so we can do both 
00:00:56	00:00:59	1	they've got their nine hundred and ninety free minutes 
00:01:04	00:01:13	2	your friends lisa okay you put you can pick who you want to put it on and it's very strategic you can you know develop your tree how you want 
00:01:13	00:01:15	1	right <unk> 
00:01:15	00:01:19	2	okay so now once okay draw a line from 
00:01:19	00:01:21	1	from the bottom of your circle 
00:01:21	00:01:27	2	straight down in the middle so that in dividing nutrient to left and right side yeah okay 
00:01:27	00:01:30	2	everything goes left and right so 
00:01:30	00:01:31	1	is um 
00:01:32	00:01:38	2	what happens is um once you've so okay 
00:01:38	00:01:40	1	two people 
00:01:40	00:01:44	2	you got you got time and lease on one side and you have mine ricky 
00:01:44	00:01:45	1	i'd say right 
00:01:46	00:01:47	1	okay then you automatically 
00:01:59	00:02:02	1	<unk> mhm no 
00:02:02	00:02:04	2	you saw an additional thousand in each leg

00:02:05	00:02:07	2	yeah i'm enjoying a thousand 
00:02:07	00:02:10	1	at that because you got six hundred and six hundred 
00:02:10	00:02:12	2	that's twelve hundred 
00:02:12	00:02:20	1	so that's at least a thousand as soon as you sell a thousand dollars worth i mean you could sell a six hundred and two hundred and two hundred but i'm just doing the best case scenario 
00:02:20	00:02:26	2	two people at six hundred dollars age is at least a thousand so you 
00:02:26	00:02:28	1	as soon as you hit a thousand dollars in each leg 
00:02:28	00:02:30	2	you get two hundred dollars 
00:02:30	00:02:31	1	you got that part 
00:02:31	00:02:34	2	mhm no 
00:02:35	00:02:36	2	well 
00:02:36	00:02:38	2	another thousand 
00:02:38	00:02:39	1	each leg 
00:02:40	00:02:41	1	so you're you're up 
00:02:41	00:02:42	2	say 
00:02:42	00:02:45	2	yeah two hundred dollars or twenty minutes 
00:02:45	00:02:48	1	two hundred dollars plus another three hundred minutes 
00:02:48	00:02:50	1	[laughter] that's right so i forgot 
00:02:50	00:02:52	2	forget about the extra minutes you get everytime you hit us 
00:02:52	00:02:53	1	level yeah 
00:02:53	00:02:55	2	every time he hits them 
00:02:55	00:02:56	1	yeah 
00:02:56	00:03:02	2	so you're getting all these <unk> you end up with more minutes and you have are neat and so what <unk> 
00:03:02	00:03:05	1	he gives out he says if you come here and listen to 
00:03:05	00:03:08	2	seminar about this uh you know 
00:03:08	00:03:11	1	just common listen you don't do anything and i know you love it but 
00:03:11	00:03:17	2	if you don't you know whatever i'll give you ten free minutes it calling long distance just for common 
00:03:17	00:03:25	2	he gives him out so he gets older people you know whatever you use your own network you whoever you want your long distance carrier 
00:03:25	00:03:27	1	hi this is dick already did 
00:03:29	00:03:33	2	how did that for us so m._c._i. must pay them access charges i imagine yeah 
00:03:33	00:03:37	1	i'm sure they probably by by bulk volume of all the 
00:03:37	00:03:43	2	no we're <unk> neck of the time and i network time what you can't buy network um 
00:03:43	00:03:43	1	what they do 
00:03:43	00:03:49	2	you know how they do it well i don't know but you probably know better find out 
00:03:49	00:03:51	2	i know how they make their money 
00:03:51	00:03:52	1	well 
00:03:52	00:03:54	2	well because 
00:03:54	00:03:57	1	and then thirty minutes of long distance on m._c._i. cost you 
00:03:57	00:04:09	2	well see it's only about i don't know it depends on the time of day but it can be as low as nineteen censored less i mean sprint you get ten cents a minute but this you're paying sixty eight cents a minute 
00:04:09	00:04:11	1	for the original 
00:04:11	00:04:19	2	mm okay but you're not paying the long run because wait i didn't even get into the the good part so so a thousand each leg 
00:04:19	00:04:27	2	you make two hundred dollars back so now you got your original three hundred thirty minutes class when you get your two hundred dollars you get another three another five 
00:04:27	00:04:31	1	or a bonus card prepaid calling card three hundred minutes 
00:04:31	00:04:32	1	so now you've got 
00:04:32	00:04:33	2	mhm 
00:04:33	00:04:41	2	six hundred and thirty free minutes and you get two hundred dollars back okay no once you hit it in another an additional 
00:04:41	00:04:47	1	thousand dollars in each leg that's another two people say yeah on each leg 
00:04:49	00:04:50	1	hello 
00:04:51	00:04:52	1	more minutes 
00:04:53	00:04:54	1	okay 
00:05:06	00:05:08	1	plus more minutes 
00:05:13	00:05:14	2	well yeah 
00:05:14	00:05:18	1	i don't do it the most you'll get it when people do and i have two hundred 
00:05:18	00:05:20	2	well <unk> found that 
00:05:21	00:05:23	2	when you see how good it is you'll see because 
00:05:23	00:05:26	1	mark found that it takes about 
00:05:26	00:05:29	2	um he says most people are putting in six hundred because they 
00:05:29	00:05:31	1	see how good at it but 
00:05:31	00:05:37	2	some people put into 'cause that's all they have but he says he finds that it takes on the average about 
00:05:37	00:05:44	2	you know it it it takes to make three thousand on each side which is what you want to achieve three thousand on each side that's the big number 
00:05:45	00:05:52	2	um you can either get five people paying six hundred eat all you can get fifteen people paying two hundred 
00:05:52	00:05:53	1	right right so 
00:05:53	00:05:57	2	it's anywhere from and that's on each side so it's anywhere from ten to thirty 
00:05:57	00:05:58	1	hello 
00:05:58	00:06:02	2	usually <unk> you know before you get three thousand on each side 
00:06:02	00:06:02	1	yeah 
00:06:02	00:06:05	1	um but he's finding that 
00:06:05	00:06:14	2	on the average it averages out to about seven people on each side so most of them put in six hundred instead of five people and he said it's seven 'cause some people put in too 
00:06:14	00:06:15	1	he said his average 
00:06:15	00:06:18	2	seven hundred seven people on each side 
00:06:18	00:06:20	1	to get three 
00:06:20	00:06:21	2	and each side 
00:06:25	00:06:27	1	people below you already 
00:06:27	00:06:30	1	well yeah see that's the thing you don't have 
00:06:30	00:06:47	2	when i say seven people in each side that means not just you you may have just put in one person <unk> people above you're putting people <unk> and the people that the one person who got knows people you know people as it national and international or just now you can pick either a national guard or a <unk> or an international card you could do some 
00:06:47	00:06:48	1	speech whatever 
00:06:49	00:06:59	2	and i thought some i heard somebody say that an international conquered you get a little less minutes but dick said no but i don't know i'd have to find that out okay 
00:06:59	00:07:03	1	so if you buy three you get things below you or you get three 
00:07:03	00:07:05	1	that start so okay beyond profits 
00:07:05	00:07:11	2	all right that's what i was going to get too well first of all when he finished one more step to this

00:20:37	00:20:42	1	well why would they why would they um why would they do it 
00:20:42	00:20:45	2	cause you make the checks out to the company you know make the checks out to them

00:20:48	00:20:57	2	when you go in you make your money order out you send it to the company right you don't send it to the people above you so why would the people above you be doing it 
00:21:08	00:21:12	2	and why would he even do the seminars if he weren't getting his checks that he's supposed to 
00:21:12	00:21:14	1	'cause he's getting the money 
00:21:14	00:21:16	2	no you don't send them to handle

00:21:43	00:21:44	1	you know 
00:21:44	00:21:46	1	and it makes sense you know

00:21:48	00:21:50	1	money if you figure 
00:21:50	00:21:52	2	how much money um
