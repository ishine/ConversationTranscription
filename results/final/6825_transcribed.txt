00:00:01	00:00:06	2	okay that was the belief recording 
00:00:06	00:00:08	1	yeah yeah i know 
00:00:08	00:00:14	2	anyway um idea which may or may not happen is um 
00:00:14	00:00:16	2	drive up picking one car trips 
00:00:16	00:00:17	1	<unk> 
00:00:19	00:00:20	1	mhm 
00:00:23	00:00:30	1	um well code stopping off um in wisconsin to see palm um and we we 
00:00:30	00:00:40	2	stopping off in wisconsin um you need to go through chicago or past chicago first or meeting and i know um i don't understand 
00:00:40	00:00:43	1	oh okay meaning maybe meeting time in chicago 
00:00:56	00:01:00	1	this is still in the kind of um tentative idea stage 
00:01:00	00:01:01	1	um not 
00:01:01	00:01:03	2	how's it going to happen 
00:01:04	00:01:05	1	yeah 
00:01:05	00:01:06	2	uh-huh 
00:01:06	00:01:07	1	would be interesting 
00:01:08	00:01:09	1	um 
00:01:09	00:01:11	2	[laughter] 
00:01:12	00:01:13	1	oh louisiana 
00:01:13	00:01:14	2	for 
00:01:14	00:01:15	1	uh-huh 
00:01:15	00:01:17	2	but when you larry for 
00:01:17	00:01:20	1	but just getting has been going on <unk> 
00:01:20	00:01:23	2	yeah he larger would make us 
00:01:23	00:01:26	1	yeah um 
00:01:26	00:01:34	2	speaking of speaking of which i i've been like i've been thinking like i really want to go some place warm here like for a weekend trip or something 
00:01:34	00:01:42	1	[noise] but i'm just i'm getting more and more frustrated with the fact that i apparently can even communicate basic things to people 
00:01:45	00:01:49	2	[laughter] 
00:01:49	00:01:50	1	and your friend though 
00:01:50	00:01:57	2	stop [noise] no it it's the second time i've gotten into um like 
00:01:57	00:01:58	1	uh oh 
00:01:58	00:02:10	2	shop and and like ordered a sandwich and like you know we're sitting there like drinking something for a while thinking like okay maybe they didn't understand maybe they said oh no sorry we 
00:02:10	00:02:14	1	you know can't make any any of that today or something i don't know 
00:02:14	00:02:20	2	so it's just really frustrating so [laughter] um 
00:02:20	00:02:28	1	mostly mostly i think it's a shopping or something like that i <unk> i want to go and the other 
00:02:28	00:02:31	2	and it's just you want to 'cause i don't 
00:02:31	00:02:35	1	um well i need to find things for people 
00:02:40	00:02:42	1	i have to bring people things 
00:02:42	00:02:46	2	oh i thought you meant like when you got here you wanted to go shopping and it's like 
00:02:46	00:02:48	1	no no 
00:02:48	00:02:52	2	what what would be in kids took to take on a weekend um 
00:02:57	00:02:59	1	[laughter] um 
00:02:59	00:03:02	2	we could drive in new york and and see the strand 
00:03:02	00:03:03	1	that too 
00:03:03	00:03:23	2	[noise] i mean like the shows the shows can wait the strength cannot i mean i'm i'm cumulative a list of books that i well my my idea is okay i'll i'll see if i can find them used if not then i'll i'll open if if if hold on 
00:03:29	00:03:39	2	<unk> <unk> if we if i end up going home for spring break i will be in new york i'll <unk> i'll probably be stopping by hand send to me the list and them out to be willing to pay for books 
00:03:39	00:03:43	1	couldn't pick up some for you you pay me back 
00:03:43	00:03:56	2	right most most of the ones that i really need it it's like if you can find them used then it doesn't matter how much they are because even if they're really expensive it will save me money in the long run 
00:03:56	00:04:02	1	okay yeah i'm just saying if i was <unk> like a list and even if prices just you know 
00:04:02	00:04:09	2	pray price would be would be um this is prices of book you don't pay more than that [laughter] 
00:04:09	00:04:13	1	yeah um but no i mean like i'm like well how much are willing to spend in total like 
00:04:19	00:04:21	1	probably i would 
00:04:21	00:04:25	2	just a whole lot like things just i'd feel better 
00:04:27	00:04:45	2	yeah that's fine i mean first of all you need the list of books but i mean even even so it's like it's patrick the timing is so bad if if you know ever coming back and then you'd spring break or you'd a long weekend or something and i could go home with you and and 
00:04:45	00:04:51	1	[noise] yeah from shopping myself all the time it's been with you need lots of time to be nice 
00:04:51	00:04:56	2	oh so i picked up the mess price questions 
00:04:56	00:04:59	1	[laughter] it's going to say [laughter] so that was 
00:04:59	00:05:07	2	um <unk> already a question i started question too 'cause he's here it has to question authority self one of them 
00:05:07	00:05:08	1	but it was really 
00:05:08	00:05:09	2	mhm 
00:05:09	00:05:12	2	[noise] it's proved that in a write triangle 
00:05:12	00:05:14	1	you know that some of the 
00:05:21	00:05:24	1	that's really really crazy 
00:05:24	00:05:24	2	simple 
00:05:24	00:05:26	1	it's very easy 
00:05:28	00:05:36	2	yeah that's nice um the other ones that yet i'm still i'm still working on these math problems i meant to spend a lot of today working 
00:05:36	00:05:41	1	pascal huh do you do stop the task i'll try and go 
00:05:41	00:05:45	2	um no i haven't gotten around to really like seriously looking at it 
00:05:45	00:05:47	1	there's i think it helps 
00:05:47	00:05:56	2	whole there's one that i've been working on it you know and they're the reason is is that i used to find the <unk> break formula because it would be a pain to do that otherwise 
00:05:58	00:06:06	2	truly what that <unk> yeah it is it is with the hunters line and to me up but it could do too much we would just be a pain 
00:06:06	00:06:14	1	<unk> what i did to solve it but i just wrote out like the first couple of lines and just oh jeeze i didn't even 
00:06:19	00:06:28	1	yeah that's that's fine i mean i figured something like that it's just they're like i know i can tell that one right now i'm dealing with problems that like i should be able to solve the thirties 
00:06:28	00:06:30	2	going yeah like what okay 
00:06:30	00:06:31	1	um typically 
00:06:31	00:06:35	2	this is the one that <unk> there too they're too problem 
00:06:35	00:06:45	1	i've been working on and off and not [noise] um one is you have three schools exactly and people who do your school 
00:06:45	00:06:55	2	each person is each school nose at least and plus one of the two in people at the other schools prove it there are at least three people who all knew each other knowing knowing his mutual 
00:06:55	00:06:59	1	yeah oh you know he he talked about that one 
00:06:59	00:07:00	1	dave 
00:07:02	00:07:03	1	hello 
00:07:03	00:07:04	1	what 
00:07:04	00:07:07	2	who do we know that send the statistics 
00:07:08	00:07:12	2	do you that's not statistics has to come in a trickle problem 
00:07:12	00:07:14	1	that's the do you do 
00:07:14	00:07:15	2	mhm no 
00:07:15	00:07:20	1	yes um sets sets sets of and possibility is probably 
00:07:20	00:07:34	2	no no no it's not probability you know i know that that must should involve right but i mean i've gotten i like uh there [laughter] i tried i tried the simplest way to solve it and that that isn't that isn't enough 
00:07:34	00:07:37	1	and then i'm working on the second one which says something like 
00:07:37	00:07:38	2	okay 
00:07:38	00:07:40	2	at the first school you have and people 
00:07:40	00:07:42	1	you know and plus one people 
00:07:42	00:07:49	2	out of two and people that means that they know and squared plus and [laughter] um two and people 
00:07:49	00:07:58	1	i i did not make any sense until i sit down with a pencil and paper and okay okay well the only way i understand that it's okay i don't say until i worked on uh 
00:07:58	00:07:59	1	oh like 
00:07:59	00:08:04	2	so it depends on if you want i'll send you these two questions 
00:08:04	00:08:05	1	working yeah 
00:08:05	00:08:12	2	do too because it's like they're they're they're not difficult problems and 
00:08:12	00:08:15	2	and i understand exactly what's happening in them 
00:08:15	00:08:16	1	[noise] um 
00:08:16	00:08:22	2	well i mean i understand plenty of what's happening i'm sure there's there's a lot more that i don't understand or else the solution would probably be really simple 
00:08:22	00:08:24	1	[noise] um 
00:08:25	00:08:30	2	but it's it's really fun really [laughter] but i i wish it it 
00:08:30	00:08:32	1	we um 
00:08:32	00:08:36	2	but uh i'm just i'm really really happy 
00:08:36	00:08:38	1	person no posted this list 
00:08:38	00:08:42	2	and they're really they're really cool thing about it is 
00:08:42	00:08:44	1	um like 
00:08:44	00:08:55	2	there are a lot of problems that like there's some problems that that because of being at the gym <unk> i was able to to like give answers to immediately and then there are 
00:08:55	00:08:58	1	or be a strip and half yeah 
00:08:58	00:09:01	2	i'm <unk> i'm not sure on that one he did 
00:09:01	00:09:03	1	did you say that list 
00:09:03	00:09:05	2	i have the um u._r._l. 
00:09:06	00:09:12	2	okay because because i would i could do with the problems that i'm working on is just give you the numbers phew 
00:09:12	00:09:14	1	let's see i'm trying to 
00:09:14	00:09:20	2	but i mean that would be easier nope but <unk> i i actually i have stuff saved and attack 
00:09:20	00:09:22	1	you just get two more trips 
00:09:25	00:09:27	2	i said for cutting them more restricted 
00:09:27	00:09:28	1	and half 
00:09:28	00:09:30	2	you just get to be a strip 
00:09:31	00:09:33	1	no that's not 
00:09:33	00:09:33	2	mhm 
00:09:34	00:09:35	1	why not 
00:09:35	00:09:37	2	cut and maybe a strip and huh 
00:09:37	00:09:40	1	cut cut cut in half which way 
00:09:40	00:09:42	1	mhm 
00:09:42	00:09:43	2	lengthwise 
00:09:43	00:09:48	1	okay yeah i do draw draw a line waiting to midnight yeah that would work 
00:09:48	00:09:52	2	a line in the middle of the median strip and cut along that line 
00:09:52	00:09:57	2	okay yeah that's right i see what part of the 
00:09:57	00:09:58	1	and then 
00:10:08	00:10:11	1	yeah i saw that i had to be i 
00:10:12	00:10:13	1	yeah 
00:10:13	00:10:20	2	[laughter] we [laughter] i don't know i i've never <unk> so i'm not sure 
00:10:20	00:10:27	1	yeah i mean <unk> it has to choose conflicts numbers and i got when when i get back on it i can try to explain it 
00:10:36	00:10:41	1	no <unk> i know enough about complex numbers that 
00:10:41	00:10:42	2	theoretically should have uh 
00:10:42	00:10:50	1	okay well i i certainly i i maybe then then you can when i get back to explain everything you know about complex numbers because 
00:10:50	00:10:52	2	it's been a long time 
00:10:52	00:10:55	1	well between now and then you can figure it out again 
00:10:55	00:11:00	2	so i'm really hoping to cover it wasn't my peace and determined to send out like that 
00:11:01	00:11:02	1	like 
00:11:02	00:11:05	2	they were looking at it three times so 
00:11:05	00:11:06	1	three times 
00:11:06	00:11:07	2	[laughter] 
00:11:07	00:11:09	1	i know it's the same person or what 
00:11:09	00:11:14	2	it was like three times like in a row so it was like you know for going back for twenty pages 
00:11:15	00:11:16	1	it's really weird 
00:11:16	00:11:17	2	mhm 
00:11:18	00:11:19	1	well i mean this is 
00:11:19	00:11:27	2	when they're making decisions so it's entirely possible you'll get a job with the <unk> center and then i probably won't but 
00:11:29	00:11:33	2	that would be that would be cool but not <unk> 
00:11:33	00:11:39	1	who hit my paid from place i don't even know about like someone from u. penn it's been like 
00:11:39	00:11:44	2	oh where i'm at the <unk> never mind i wonder well someone from u. penn 
00:11:44	00:11:45	1	yeah i paid a lot 
00:11:47	00:11:50	2	that's strange yeah 
00:11:50	00:11:51	1	[laughter] 
00:11:51	00:11:53	1	uh-huh 
00:11:53	00:12:02	2	<unk> a lot of uh c._g._i. scripts to do just to uh to sticks i should i should take a look at some for scripts and 
00:12:03	00:12:06	1	mm well whatever the computer what the <unk> 
00:12:13	00:12:14	1	mhm 
00:12:21	00:12:22	1	yeah 
00:12:24	00:12:34	2	okay well i mean i'm hoping it's just fun to go to go to a <unk> page and look up mathematicians his name start with 
00:12:34	00:12:38	1	no i mean i have i have it i can get the name of getting off of that program 
00:12:38	00:12:39	1	mhm 
00:12:41	00:12:41	2	mhm 
00:12:48	00:12:49	1	that's what i was <unk> 
00:12:49	00:13:01	2	that's what i would suspect right and if that's the end i mean i know i can get information on which computers which and i know like say say if i find out what's next and it's got to be in some ones 
00:13:01	00:13:03	1	and then 
00:13:03	00:13:10	2	and then it would definitely and then i would probably figure the person who's in charge of the teachers for 
00:13:10	00:13:14	1	here it's just a finger at computer and see who is luck dog 
00:13:14	00:13:22	2	yeah except you have to <unk> find find out you know you have to choose or at times we fingering 
00:13:22	00:13:29	1	well i like no i guess if your finger once or twice and there's only one person usually logged on then you know 
00:13:29	00:13:31	2	well it depends 
00:13:31	00:13:33	1	oh who are there 
00:13:33	00:13:37	2	because because because i could log on to any computer that's there 
00:13:37	00:13:40	1	that's true but they look <unk> look at 
00:13:40	00:13:44	2	<unk> yes okay so 
00:13:44	00:13:49	1	quest other president math price my mind just kind of paper today don't mind me 
00:13:49	00:13:53	2	um no i i like that there's <unk> it makes me not feels handle the data 
00:13:53	00:13:56	1	<unk> data greater than are equal to to 
00:13:56	00:13:58	1	you have to write it down for me 
00:13:58	00:13:59	2	it's it's 
00:14:02	00:14:03	1	the theater 
00:14:12	00:14:13	1	mhm 
00:14:19	00:14:20	1	okay 
00:14:20	00:14:21	2	and um 
00:14:21	00:14:24	2	<unk> anything anything interest 
00:14:26	00:14:31	2	is that an like an important thing that i've made <unk> neither do i think 
00:14:31	00:14:35	1	[noise] i've i mean i've never seen an identity that says that 
00:14:35	00:14:38	2	um but you could probably do something with like 
00:14:38	00:14:39	1	[noise] um 
00:14:40	00:14:43	2	with close friends squared plus sign square 
00:14:43	00:14:45	1	equals one 
00:14:45	00:14:46	2	mhm 
00:14:46	00:14:49	1	yeah i'm just gonna play around with that 
00:14:49	00:14:50	2	yeah 
00:14:51	00:14:57	1	i thought i had it for a second but then i realized i added added when i should've multiplied and 
00:14:57	00:15:00	2	[laughter] [laughter] that doesn't hurt 
00:15:00	00:15:08	1	yeah during the fractions and parked and so i went back and did it again and they realize what my mistake was part of that look 
00:15:08	00:15:11	2	but these are can be fun 
00:15:11	00:15:12	1	yeah 
00:15:12	00:15:15	2	i'm half way done with my apple a newspaper 
00:15:15	00:15:16	1	let's hope 
00:15:20	00:15:24	2	mm good luck with them i i hope that goes well cool 
00:15:24	00:15:28	1	to really short they're like all like hundred would quest you know answers that the most 
00:15:28	00:15:33	2	oh well short links does not mean short time 
00:15:33	00:15:37	1	no but it <unk> somebody that does it means 
00:15:37	00:15:40	1	pete concise and clear but 
00:15:40	00:15:43	2	right right i know but i mean 
00:15:43	00:15:50	1	work with the small confessing clearance or is it when they <unk> like yeah we'd like three pages on like your course 
00:15:55	00:15:57	1	right well i'm 
00:15:57	00:16:00	2	[noise] it's just tell you like 
00:16:01	00:16:08	1	i have like deadlines this week but i just don't want to deal with like their their 
00:16:08	00:16:13	2	not that <unk> that are just sort of been sitting and most of the stuff is done except i have to revamp essays 
00:16:13	00:16:16	1	and my answer is so far i haven't been that up sending 
00:16:20	00:16:27	2	you know a couple of good i hope you don't need any <unk> better what do they hook it up you got any more 
00:16:27	00:16:30	1	condition i don't know i don't know 
00:16:30	00:16:32	1	i am so i'm i'm 
00:16:32	00:16:42	2	usually really sorry i <unk> i really want to do like something really nice for the tutors hoop and like writing like just mr right and and 
00:16:42	00:16:45	1	particularly 'cause i keep bothering them with stuff 
00:16:49	00:16:51	1	i should have figured out 
00:16:51	00:16:57	2	central steps and needed to apply for the beginning i can't do those things

00:21:10	00:21:13	1	why it my i was still loves on because 
00:21:13	00:21:22	2	i went to like like sort of they help from from i mean er you know um because i was trying to get yeah 
00:21:22	00:21:23	1	mm oh yeah 
00:21:23	00:21:25	2	trying to <unk> 
00:21:25	00:21:27	1	so frustrated so i know and 
00:21:27	00:21:28	2	oh great great well 
00:21:28	00:21:31	1	huh the database yeah yeah 
00:21:31	00:21:50	2	it was it was really bad and so like i i i had said like it around for a quarter after for um uh your time [noise] excuse me i i sent like this really did help message of what you know like i need it 
00:21:50	00:21:51	1	and um 
00:21:51	00:21:54	2	and that i was having problems like 
00:21:54	00:21:57	1	being just sort of crossing my fingers that like someone you know would 
00:21:57	00:22:05	2	like when they actually got around to answer my question would would just give me the information that i needed yeah other than telling me how to get it 
00:22:05	00:22:06	1	and so i was really 
00:22:06	00:22:10	2	perhaps because because they wound up like that uh that 
00:22:10	00:22:18	1	um if i had had stayed there i would've gotten this message from this person like i figured that i would get it on monday 
00:22:18	00:22:31	2	<unk> something that was you know on the east coast it was in maryland government people you know whatever it's like forget it i'm not getting any information and and it was really depressing 'cause it's like you know i need to get 
00:22:31	00:22:32	1	stuffed on this weekend 
00:22:33	00:22:34	1	and so

00:23:22	00:23:24	1	um 
00:23:24	00:23:29	2	and so i was looking at that and that was that was just not that long ago about an hour ago 
00:23:29	00:23:31	1	um i think 
00:23:40	00:23:53	2	country is basically just a matter of ah gee let's classify things according to how much structure they have ah you know like <unk> being closed upon an operation sort of thing 
00:23:53	00:23:58	1	i just <unk> pascal try and go for it just there's so many cool things you can do [laughter]

00:25:43	00:25:45	1	what's the topic 
00:25:45	00:25:47	2	i'm just looking at like how 
00:25:49	00:25:52	2	in general like the different <unk> different 
00:25:52	00:25:53	1	but <unk> but it is 
00:25:53	00:25:56	2	groups of <unk> ah what the troops are doing that you progress 
00:25:57	00:25:59	1	yeah it's nothing exciting 
00:25:59	00:26:04	2	yeah that's that's <unk> [laughter] okay 
00:26:04	00:26:07	1	<unk> where do we finally got back to the pool proof 
00:26:09	00:26:10	1	like 
00:26:12	00:26:19	2	um after twenty bucks between twenty one in like fifty where you're just finding weird angles than like we were 
00:26:19	00:26:20	1	shows like 
00:26:20	00:26:24	2	but don't really know how to run in and then there's the end of the little girl she was like oh it's 
00:26:24	00:26:26	1	garbage the under the <unk> [laughter] 
00:26:26	00:26:28	2	uh other complicated 
00:26:28	00:26:34	1	that's what i that's what i was referring to that stupid <unk> like when i was thinking of added middle but it's really <unk> effort towards the end 
00:26:34	00:26:36	2	and then you have the cool stuff again 
00:26:36	00:26:38	1	you can extract stuff 
00:26:38	00:26:38	1	mhm 
00:26:39	00:26:40	1	mhm 
00:26:43	00:26:52	2	oh um so the thing i'm thinking about is so i really really thin 
00:26:59	00:27:02	2	they know of any good places to do that 
00:27:02	00:27:03	1	teach math

00:27:35	00:27:36	1	mhm mhm

00:27:44	00:27:45	1	mhm 
00:27:48	00:27:51	1	just trying to think of other places and you're just 
00:27:51	00:27:55	2	any any any other thing is you know i mean 
00:27:55	00:27:56	1	mhm 
00:27:56	00:28:05	2	i i need to find out something about um like they had they had the real internships peace will let me think 
00:28:08	00:28:10	1	mhm 
00:28:10	00:28:15	2	i was i was going to apply for it except i couldn't get there 
00:28:15	00:28:17	1	really 
00:28:17	00:28:19	1	last year 
00:28:19	00:28:30	2	right right i know i know there there is something we got in the beginning of october might have been <unk> i want to find out about that i found out you know even if i'm not currently farmed 
00:28:30	00:28:34	1	and you know email the place in office or write to place man 
00:28:34	00:28:37	2	i don't think i don't think my boss has

00:28:41	00:28:42	1	how often they check it 
00:28:42	00:28:49	1	well they i don't think they do because like i never got mail from doctor jay after it like 
00:28:49	00:28:52	2	you know whatever she said this tell ya hello 
00:29:04	00:29:07	2	yeah that's that's what i figured 
00:29:07	00:29:09	1	um and so i'm thinking 
00:29:09	00:29:23	2	but even with a place in office there's probably too about the same extent which is not at all um i'm figuring that that that's just something like like either like i figured i'd ask you about it but i figured it came right back 
00:29:23	00:29:23	1	[noise] 
00:29:25	00:29:32	2	<unk> to them they're um ask with information on what what what what school

00:29:36	00:29:39	2	well when i have some free time actually i think they may start 
00:29:39	00:29:40	1	looking through 
00:29:43	00:29:44	1	okay 
00:29:44	00:29:51	2	just beat for myself 'cause i like annapolis elementary it's a good find someplace else tour or i might be able to do a bit more
