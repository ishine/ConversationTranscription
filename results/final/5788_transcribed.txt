00:05:31	00:05:38	1	crying for a while on the phone just kinda <unk> i couldn't [noise] it was so bad because one is like i can 
00:05:38	00:05:42	2	he uh trust him trusted him link 
00:05:42	00:05:44	1	no no like 
00:05:57	00:06:00	1	yeah and it was so bad because it was right when i got here 
00:06:00	00:06:08	2	so it was like i didn't want to meet anybody knew i couldn't like i'm so damn stands crying like constantly you know and it was just like i couldn't trust anybody 
00:06:41	00:06:42	1	i don't know 
00:06:42	00:06:44	2	if i could ever trust 
00:06:44	00:06:49	1	i don't i don't know if he's not like that though like the i don't think i am a little dress anybody like that again 
00:06:49	00:06:57	2	er of times i've heard a woman's day i know he would never do that i know him you would never do that i swear you said it i swear i said it i've always said to him and say it 
00:06:57	00:06:58	1	oh i didn't realize that it 
00:07:21	00:07:26	1	faithful kind of thing i imagine that kind of person who would beat this young romantic 
00:07:26	00:07:29	2	fool passionate and like just crazy and 
00:07:29	00:07:31	1	not beard 
00:07:31	00:07:49	2	kicked her out for me though like yeah i mean i don't wanna see that we trusted their own people because i mean i really believe that david the good person right and like at first i like when he first told me i'm just like david you know always love you or whatever but i i'm going to go now and you made your decision and there's nothing else to talk 
00:07:49	00:07:53	1	so in a way he was trying to tell you something by doing that you know oh yeah 
00:07:53	00:08:07	2	he's totally like unhappy by what was going on because he basically he wanted to be the other right he wanted like he needed a sexual relationship yeah and he needed me to be there and he needed to like someone nurturing and all that crap and i just wasn't 
00:08:07	00:08:08	1	and i know that 
00:08:16	00:08:31	2	he did me the biggest favor though and that's why like i got over really quickly it's kind of funny because yeah because like at first it was really devastating right like it's so weird because the difference between josh and him like just was devastating for a long time for me 
00:08:31	00:08:33	1	even though he wasn't as nearly 
00:08:33	00:08:39	2	as like i never had as many as deep feelings for him and it never like with this year 
00:08:39	00:08:41	1	in many ways but 
00:08:41	00:08:48	2	david it was like i think 'cause i'd been in pain for so long with like problems with my parents have problems with him and 
00:08:48	00:08:49	1	pressure 
00:08:49	00:08:51	2	by the time he finally cheated on me i just really 
00:08:51	00:08:56	1	is my first they didn't say i had to okay interesting so 
00:08:56	00:08:57	2	them goodbye and then 
00:08:57	00:09:01	1	he called me again like a day later too 
00:09:01	00:09:07	2	we talk things over and then he called me and we talk things or if they decided that i could forgive him right and we could still 
00:09:07	00:09:10	1	going out because they still loved him and i could understand 
00:09:10	00:09:20	2	how it happened because of the situation but i i told him i still thought it was shitty and horrible and whatever that i can forgive him but it would take on 
00:09:20	00:09:21	1	rational view i can't believe 
00:09:21	00:09:26	2	you know but it was though and i really did like forgive him it was like you know i thought 
00:09:26	00:09:29	1	that whole thing and and and besides many times i thought it 
00:09:29	00:09:35	2	cheating too because i like i just could understand that part of them really well you know and at the time when he called me 
00:09:35	00:09:37	1	there for him and he really needed to talk to 
00:09:37	00:09:42	2	and i said it was really cool i was like listen my parents are here i can't talk to you by you know 
00:09:42	00:09:45	1	so then i had 
00:09:45	00:09:55	2	given him but it's still like just heard it wasn't the same any more you know and he was so far away and there are other people here that were interesting to me and i didn't 
00:09:55	00:09:58	1	him to come live with me i didn't want it and 
00:09:58	00:10:01	2	yeah and it helps a lot of pressure and 
00:10:01	00:10:03	1	wanna promising we'd come live with him when i 
00:10:03	00:10:08	2	for a year and so finally we had another conversation a while ago and 
00:10:08	00:10:09	1	[noise] 
00:10:09	00:10:20	2	and um [noise] it was actually a while ago i was in september or something you know early september and i was just like you know we didn't really need to talk and i think it's really over and blah blah blah and and he's 
00:10:20	00:10:21	1	like he was less 
00:10:21	00:10:27	2	like i was more like it's over and he's less like it's okay you know but he's like okay 
00:10:39	00:10:41	1	and so he's just like 
00:10:41	00:10:43	2	even if you really want to get back together 
00:10:43	00:10:45	1	<unk> 
00:10:45	00:10:51	2	i'm just like no i like you know he made me start crying she started like rented this thing i hate when they do that 
00:10:51	00:10:52	1	right right 
00:10:52	00:10:59	2	yeah so i started crying a bit and i had been sick and like on medicine all week so i you know it's just like you're depressed anyway 
00:10:59	00:11:01	1	and so 
00:11:01	00:11:03	2	and so he's just like well that's good 
00:11:03	00:11:13	1	you know back together and i wanna see you and all this stuff and i'm just like and then i like at the end the conversation i got myself together and like no you know i like worm going he's like well where are you going on like 
00:11:13	00:11:14	2	no but i like that 
00:11:16	00:11:24	2	i can't promise to see you again or whatever 'cause then it just like you know <unk> it's all been i can't explain it but it you know it just 
00:11:24	00:11:28	1	it's not right 'cause all the pressure feeling started coming back and everything 
00:11:28	00:11:39	2	[noise] so and he says and i'm like listen you know you never know we make it back together we in the future but i just can't think about that now i want to be free and all that stuff so then he just got a letter from him so 
00:11:39	00:11:43	1	and he's like you know i really miss <unk> easily 
00:11:43	00:11:50	2	big phone bill can you hardly pay no way and um right forget that 
00:11:50	00:11:55	1	well the thing is though is like i would help them pay it because he 
00:11:55	00:12:00	2	paid for everything like more seriously this guy spent like twelve thousand dollars for a relationship or something 
00:12:00	00:12:02	1	sounds like you don't 
00:12:02	00:12:05	2	due to see me three times right that's true 
00:12:05	00:12:10	1	paid for all the phone bills he paid for every <unk> <unk> like last summer 
00:12:10	00:12:16	2	we pay for anything yeah and like do you ever come to japan no no okay 
00:12:16	00:12:33	1	and like the thing is is that i wanted to help him pay for part of the phone bill right i still got pissed because i felt like listen if you hadn't screwed around we wouldn't have talked too much and the phone but i know we would have talked to a lot [noise] and plus he <unk> he just i just feel so grateful that were like broken up i can't tell you hungry 
00:12:33	00:12:37	2	the way it makes things simpler for you is such a complicated situation it really 
00:12:59	00:13:05	1	like he just shouldn't have called so much i don't have that problem i didn't i had a phone bill but mine was like 
00:13:05	00:13:09	2	hundred dollars though is like talks all the times that i call them right 
00:13:09	00:13:11	1	he says over a thousand 
00:13:11	00:13:18	2	oh my god yeah and like i just wouldn't do that 'cause i knew i couldn't handle that kind of phone bill you know what i mean so 
00:13:18	00:13:19	1	[noise] 
00:13:19	00:13:33	2	that just makes me kinda mad because it's part of him and how easy responsible with money and whatever so i was going to help them pay for it but i can't yet because i'm going to move and it costs over three thousand dollars to move in japan yeah so i don't have in that kinda money right now 
00:13:33	00:13:35	1	what you're doing with 
00:13:35	00:13:43	2	dating and stuff you see anyone special or you just like thing a bunch of people a bunch of people who are teaching there as well or are they
