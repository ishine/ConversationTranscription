00:00:00	00:00:03	2	you didn't hang up [laughter] 
00:00:03	00:00:04	1	please hang up now 
00:00:04	00:00:17	2	don't do it don't you [laughter] okay well we have to make eight thirty minute phone call believe it or not um how <unk> how are things there and uh how did the uh film festival 
00:00:17	00:00:23	1	to still going on so that way but just to me is this project like are you gonna analyze my grandma or something 
00:00:23	00:00:35	2	well i here's what it is it's a project of the university of pennsylvania linguistics project and they're getting samples of people in in the number of different languages and uh 
00:00:47	00:00:50	2	i just wonder what it was 
00:00:50	00:00:56	1	yeah i mean that's my understanding that's it's just a matter of uh it's like kind of a great way to have a free phone call 
00:00:56	00:00:58	2	[laughter] no neither do 
00:00:58	00:01:00	1	sitting around waiting for 
00:01:00	00:01:03	2	you know to get a free phone call but i just thought it would be fun 
00:01:03	00:01:07	1	it's like i could make every phone call to america that would work out better 
00:01:07	00:01:18	2	uh-huh well actually to my knowledge um they're only going they only do this from the u._s. to um you know to your 
00:01:18	00:01:18	1	mhm 
00:01:18	00:01:31	2	um i mean from from the u. s. an outward uh as far as i know they don't do the other direction but we could find out and if if it turns out that it does and we could have them contacts you have a pet [laughter] 
00:01:34	00:01:54	2	i mean you know uh i think that there's somebody else ask that and i i think that ah first of all they want a native speaker and see i can call my brother in new york has one of my two <unk> two hours opportunities to make a three thirty minute phone call [noise] one is overseas and the others to my brother 
00:01:54	00:01:55	1	and that's it [laughter] 
00:01:55	00:02:06	2	and in your case unless you had another native speaker there was long distance from you that was over there this this might be the only opportunity you know what i'm saying 
00:02:06	00:02:09	1	right right so sorry about that 
00:02:09	00:02:18	2	yeah i was getting it is it really eleven p._m. over there yeah well it's a little it's like eleven o four 
00:02:18	00:02:24	1	right i understand well um great what can we talk about [laughter] 
00:02:24	00:02:29	2	wow do you tell me what's going on in america i haven't seen the news and easy 
00:02:29	00:02:30	1	really 
00:02:30	00:02:32	2	i know what's going on of russia 
00:02:32	00:02:40	1	yeah well let's see what's going on uh you mean they just give you some headlines 
00:02:40	00:02:43	2	yeah give it up too 
00:02:59	00:03:00	1	hello 
00:03:00	00:03:10	2	allowances strictly based on race but at the same time uh the analysis in the news shall we say the conservative analysis in the news is that 
00:03:10	00:03:14	1	clinton just came out and said that he doesn't believe 
00:03:14	00:03:31	2	[noise] in quota systems and in reverse discrimination but that he does believe that affirmative action is necessary to move uh you know black americans forward into give them the opportunities that they've been denied so he's trying to kind of walking a tight rope you know what i'm saying 
00:03:31	00:03:31	1	right 
00:03:31	00:03:36	2	in other words the sinus these everybody yeah let's see what we can make everybody 
00:03:36	00:03:39	1	[laughter] i think that 
00:03:39	00:03:40	2	ends up making nobody have 
00:03:40	00:04:01	1	think you're right [laughter] 'cause you know affirmative action really under attack in the united states from many different quarters right and it's a big it's a big issue because it's supposed to be a gender i mean not a gender hey race ah colorblind we're supposed to be race color blind and yet it's like contractors that are bidding 
00:04:01	00:04:13	2	you know with a high bit or higher than the lowest that are still getting the contracts only because they are uh ethnic protected you know black or whatever and it's really you know 
00:04:13	00:04:13	1	yeah 
00:04:17	00:04:20	1	another thing that just came up was that this 
00:04:20	00:04:34	2	scream courts said that the um redistricting of the congressional districts one of which is in georgia violated the constitution because it was based primarily on race 
00:05:01	00:05:03	1	and then it was a challenge because it's 
00:05:03	00:05:04	2	said well the only <unk> 
00:05:04	00:05:06	1	and it's been done this way 
00:05:06	00:05:09	2	to ensure that it was majority black 
00:05:09	00:05:10	1	and that's not 
00:05:10	00:05:15	2	you know 
00:05:15	00:05:17	1	hello 
00:05:17	00:05:34	2	i'm here okay and are willing all this over yeah i mean if it was interesting just today we had a discussion with students about um 'cause we doing a pretty departure orientation so we weren't we had a hot topic discussions neighbor we breaking small groups and we talked about like political correctness and raise the price 
00:05:37	00:05:47	2	i think different topics that they might encounter in america where the people are different addict so that was one of those things but i have one not really up on what you gotta do this 
00:05:47	00:05:49	1	because i haven't been there 
00:05:49	00:06:03	2	well there's a lot of frustration i think over the fact that there are there are a number of evidence is that the affirmative action program is in fact discriminating the other direction and people are saying wait a minute why don't we just give everybody 
00:06:03	00:06:04	1	uh-huh 
00:06:21	00:06:25	2	and as a result some uh some people are getting contracts 
00:06:25	00:06:27	1	just because of the color of their 
00:06:27	00:06:32	2	good and you know what i'm saying it's it's when they might not even be the most qualified 
00:06:32	00:06:40	1	either them they're they're not even they're not the loaded you know normally on contracts you take the low bad than meets the quality expect specifications 
00:06:40	00:06:50	2	right and but now you there have been several cases where it's clearly you know it was they didn't get it because they just did worth the right color skin so now 
00:06:50	00:06:52	1	is that really remedying the situation 
00:06:52	00:06:54	2	it's creating a lot of uh 
00:06:54	00:06:56	1	uh uh resentment 
00:06:56	00:07:03	2	yeah and it's kinda too bad how's it going on now oh it's a mess really how long have you been there by the way 
00:07:03	00:07:06	1	over here um it'll be three years 
00:07:06	00:07:11	2	wow so you really are out of <unk> [laughter] 
00:07:11	00:07:13	1	i like to think i'm not totally huh 
00:07:13	00:07:15	2	well i go with it 
00:07:15	00:07:18	1	touch even when i was still in america 
00:07:18	00:07:20	2	oh okay you're that type i gotcha 
00:07:20	00:07:23	1	[laughter] oh i do my own world anyway [laughter] 
00:07:23	00:07:45	2	[laughter] well i notice like because i <unk> having lived over in korea for almost three years um it's you know when you come back all of a sudden you know the society's changed a little bit you know mhm new terminology new buzz words and all of then of course when you get to be over forty like me 
00:07:45	00:07:49	1	um you could miss that stuff's just being an american anyway 
00:07:49	00:07:57	2	[laughter] it all pets i don't know i think when you get older your more informed when i was in college i didn't know what was going on i was 
00:07:57	00:08:03	1	yeah i'm thinking of er you know like uh lingo that the young people come up with you know 
00:08:36	00:08:37	1	mhm 
00:08:37	00:08:42	2	uh-huh so it's kind of a step up for me it's it's called mercer university 
00:08:42	00:08:45	1	oh well you'll have to send this material something or 
00:08:45	00:08:49	2	hey now we're talking to people into e._s._l. program 
00:08:49	00:08:51	1	mhm 
00:09:16	00:09:23	2	you know equipment uh lab equipment and all of that and they're restructuring everything so that's what i'm supposed to do next 
00:09:23	00:09:27	1	but then it's gone 
00:09:27	00:09:33	2	[noise] i i'm i've never heard of a scholarship for an english language program personally but i think 
00:09:33	00:09:35	1	but i keep thinking i'm going to find one one of these 
00:09:35	00:09:51	2	yeah i know i'm sure that they <unk> you know the question of whether they have scholarships for international students um for the regular program is a good one and i'd like to find out i'd like to think that they do and and i think they might but i don't know yet 
00:09:51	00:09:52	1	mhm 
00:09:52	00:10:02	2	it's not going to be my particular area of expertise you know it's it's that that can be regular program but still i would like to know so i can tell people

00:14:31	00:14:33	1	[noise] just <unk> 
00:14:33	00:14:49	2	censor is very bad grammar which sucks he doesn't want me she's like she was finished high school she was never into school or anything and see it and people screaming don't tend to speak correctly or well anyway but and then she has a black boyfriend and i go home i'd have to go i don't know what he's talking [laughter] 
00:14:49	00:14:52	1	oh my goodness you've got some dialect mixing up there 
00:14:52	00:14:54	2	i know 
00:14:54	00:14:55	1	yeah 
00:14:55	00:15:02	2	<unk> and i would have been interesting [laughter] yes native english speakers [laughter] 
00:15:02	00:15:04	1	no i'm not sure she calls right 
00:15:04	00:15:11	2	oh well [laughter] well you are doing primarily advising right 
00:15:13	00:15:18	2	talk to the students about educational opportunities and do you help them make applications 
00:15:18	00:15:19	1	mhm 
00:15:19	00:15:30	2	um i mean we try and get them to do it themselves maybe has to do they don't understand you know then we help some but i mean there are students who would want to sit down and threw it out with them if we would do it but we don't do that 
00:15:30	00:15:32	1	yeah right 
00:15:32	00:15:42	2	and what their essays like we were critique there there's you know the personal statements like that trying to some advice they don't rate the way america do over here at all 
00:15:42	00:15:44	1	they're very kind of 
00:15:44	00:15:55	2	right yeah yeah yeah well uh sounds like a lot of fun [laughter] 
00:15:55	00:15:57	1	yeah it's fun it's good because i don't really have um 
00:16:01	00:16:12	1	kind of not really up on what's going on and she has a lot of other programs that were kind of leave sports program so i can pretty much do whatever i want to move a lot of freedom to think of new programs or new ideas or activities and 
00:16:12	00:16:17	2	yeah that's kind of neat and i don't really like having a box over me forget what's yours 
00:16:17	00:16:23	1	right well i'll have some freedom but i'm also going to have a lot more 
00:16:23	00:16:34	2	responsibility at the at the new job so it's gonna be different i'll have teachers that i'm make supervising and all that so the first thing is to get the teachers on my side you know 
00:16:34	00:16:35	1	[laughter] 
00:16:35	00:16:36	2	oh yeah 
00:16:36	00:16:37	1	'cause if they don't 
00:16:37	00:16:39	2	you don't want everyone against it 
00:16:39	00:16:48	1	<unk> no i've got too warm you know when them over and then uh try to try to work with ah with this this could be very difficult but i'm i'm committed 
00:16:48	00:16:55	2	committed to it you know so it's gonna be it's gonna be interesting i think it's great 
00:17:05	00:17:07	1	this is a pretty big 
00:17:07	00:17:15	2	well i've been doing foreign student advising i've been teaching english as a second language and i've been was recruiting over in asia five different trips for years 
00:17:15	00:17:18	1	and activities and logistical 
00:17:18	00:17:20	2	port and immigration 
00:17:20	00:17:21	1	i kind of stuff for these 
00:17:21	00:17:35	2	here just about everything you know and over there i will be doing only english as a second language administrative work you know getting a program running and making decisions about it and you know and and also 
00:17:35	00:17:38	1	i'll probably be involved with every aspect of it but uh 
00:17:41	00:17:42	1	pasadena 
00:17:42	00:17:53	2	so ah but i think it's gonna be interesting and challenging enough to keep me busy i mean i like interaction with students but it doesn't necessarily have to be in the classroom all the time you know 
00:17:53	00:17:55	1	right i'll still 
00:17:55	00:18:01	2	i will still you know it's out of interaction with students i just won't have it quite in the same capacity 
00:18:01	00:18:02	1	mhm 
00:18:02	00:18:18	2	you know there'll be bowing down to me now instead of asking me to do favors for no i'm just kidding right but i want to ask you what you were an english teacher too i mean that makes a difference for them we have a direct you know work did you work it's just you know directing and everything is very 
00:18:18	00:18:20	1	exactly 
00:18:20	00:18:28	2	exactly and i'll probably <unk> you know go in and substitute every once in a while in the classes and that that'll be fun for me um 
00:18:28	00:18:34	1	i i do everything i mean i mean not everything but i'm saying i've been teaching at night 
00:18:34	00:18:39	2	i had another place and tutoring you know to bring an extra income 
00:18:39	00:18:39	1	mhm 
00:18:39	00:18:51	2	so uh it's just a matter of trying to you know keep it float move ahead [laughter] let me let me let me mentioned one other thing you asked about the headlines 
00:18:51	00:18:53	1	mhm 
00:18:53	00:18:57	2	are you familiar with the uh the o._j. simpson trial 
00:18:57	00:19:00	1	well when i was 
00:19:00	00:19:13	2	i heard about it and before that when i was told me <unk> oh that was on t._v. and before that when i was told me they kept showing it it'd be <unk> i'm in october they were still going on for years 
00:19:13	00:19:16	1	i know you're pretty well travelled 
00:19:16	00:19:18	2	the latest since jew 
00:19:18	00:19:25	1	well the only thing that the latest is the prosecution rested their case and now the defenses bringing as people up 
00:19:25	00:19:27	2	yeah 
00:19:27	00:19:40	1	and uh they're basically the the main defense that they have is that they they're trying to get people to believe that the police planted all of the evidence to frame o. j. simpson 
00:19:40	00:19:54	2	when i was told that um one that had detective or whatever with it whatever his name was at work for a little bit like artist yeah i'm like what would the police be doing this and there'll be a better things to do in los angeles 
00:19:54	00:19:58	1	i know it it's unbelievable it's terribly incriminating 
00:19:58	00:20:08	2	the d._n._a. evidence the blood evidence on the wheel the blood on the socks and the bloody glove on like uh it looks like for all the world that there is no other possibility it really does but 
00:20:08	00:20:09	1	see this 
00:20:09	00:20:24	2	the race thing because if they've done polls that show that seventy something percent like about seventy seventy eight percent of whites believed in o._j.'s guilty but only sixty eight sixty eight percent of blacks believe he is in it 
00:20:24	00:20:27	1	wow 
00:20:27	00:20:42	2	it's a matter of a distrust of the judicial system i think on the part of uh african americans and i think they have you know reasons for that some of those reasons or <unk> some of them may not be valid it's not this trial is not a racist 
00:20:42	00:20:44	1	but people just believe that 
00:20:44	00:20:46	2	if there's one juror that 
00:20:46	00:20:48	1	for some reason doesn't believe you 
00:20:48	00:20:51	2	fair shake he's going to walk out and he could be in fact 
00:20:51	00:20:53	1	you know what i'm saying 
00:20:53	00:20:59	2	right so people are very disillusioned right now with the uh criminal justice system here and believe me 
00:21:05	00:21:13	2	now i think you're probably right and it's too bad it's just you know what are we going to do was gotta have justice in this country and and and which which 
00:21:13	00:21:20	1	they make the whole world no too this is on t._v. i really think that's ridiculous c._n._n. was showing him let me think c._n._n. would at least the above that 
00:21:20	00:21:28	2	oh are you kidding [laughter] they're going to be where i hey [laughter] 
00:21:28	00:21:38	1	oh well oh well let me mentioned one other thing we don't have that much longer believe it or not um yeah yeah see thirty minutes goes fast when you're talking between 
00:21:50	00:21:54	1	well that's true but it is late there and i didn't want to keep you up too late and 
00:21:54	00:22:04	2	and after all it's not like on your parent you know maybe maybe your parents [laughter] i may be old enough to be a fair but i'm not your fair and [laughter] 
00:22:04	00:22:09	1	[laughter] oh well i don't know you just look a lot younger than you are 
00:22:09	00:22:11	2	[laughter] 
00:22:11	00:22:14	1	you'll you'll you'll appreciate that later 
00:22:14	00:22:16	2	mhm

00:22:20	00:22:25	2	in south carolina you heard about that susan smith trial 
00:22:25	00:22:25	1	mhm 
00:22:25	00:22:31	2	the mother that room car into the lake with her two little boys strapped in their safety seats 
00:22:31	00:22:33	1	no i didn't hear that 
00:22:33	00:22:38	2	oh it's just it's heartbreaking when when did this happen it happened last october 
00:22:38	00:22:40	1	yeah 
00:22:40	00:22:46	2	yeah she enjoys it was like this woman reported that her children had been

00:22:58	00:23:06	2	and her two sons away and she made an appeal over two weeks like about ten days or two weeks where she was saying 
00:23:06	00:23:18	1	please bring my baby's back and all of this kind of stuff and <unk> the whole nation was just shocked what they were even more shock when she finally admitted that she had uh pushed her car into the lake with him strapped into there 
00:23:18	00:23:19	2	seats and drowned them 
00:23:19	00:23:21	1	they found mine to do that 
00:23:21	00:23:44	2	oh just <unk> well the only reason the logical reason we can think is the fact that she was she was in in a divorce with her first husband and uh and she was um uh having an affair with another guy that she wanted to marry but he had written or a letter of the day that she did this thing i do not want children 
00:23:44	00:23:45	1	mhm
