00:02:49	00:02:54	2	it's uh it's quite an event and you're lucky that you're there at that time 
00:03:02	00:03:03	1	yeah 
00:03:03	00:03:10	2	and that well the one important thing i better ask you before i forget but it doesn't matter [noise] see i <unk> i had this one free phone call i said oh why not peter 
00:03:10	00:03:13	1	oh yeah [laughter] since you don't know anyone in korea 
00:03:13	00:03:18	2	it has to be somebody who speaks english also too you see that's that's the problem 
00:03:18	00:03:19	1	<unk> 
00:03:19	00:03:38	2	what is actually i should tell you and it's it's i think it's it's some research for computer for um voice recognition and you know some people could talk normally to a computer and then it could actually begin to me the trans pose what you road or all sorts of things like that 
00:03:38	00:03:41	1	into a into a voice or 
00:03:41	00:03:43	2	into text right if you were

00:05:16	00:05:20	2	well that'd be they should go up to that <unk> long island or something

00:07:28	00:07:32	1	when you're at work and say oh i can't go in four weeks how could i possibly just 
00:07:35	00:07:48	1	vacation mowed it sort of like well why shouldn't i <unk> i have the vacation all the time and money and what is money for right so i have to prepare you sound like you're the bank

00:07:57	00:07:59	1	they just have to have a discussion with my boss 
00:07:59	00:08:04	2	[laughter] so you have to let me know what you what do you think 
00:08:04	00:08:08	1	what what this entails consequences for me 
00:08:21	00:08:22	1	at least a week

00:13:40	00:13:44	1	well i mean if i was visiting new it'd be very hard not to visit them 
00:13:44	00:13:50	2	but for the year before i wouldn't i wouldn't i wouldn't tell on your you know 
00:13:50	00:14:00	1	i know you wouldn't tell but the year before i did it but that's 'cause we just stopped on the train and i had you know two hours at our wild lunch 
00:14:00	00:14:07	2	yeah yeah but [noise] we uh companies are rated yeah 
00:14:07	00:14:12	1	that sounds like you have you know

00:14:18	00:14:21	2	to change and it is a lot of work obviously 
00:14:36	00:14:40	1	yeah but i always keep <unk> than spending too much time that i should be doing other things 
00:14:40	00:14:56	2	yeah he just had this talk about somebody was saying you know confirming you know and i know i'm too self critical so it's not a good idea because i was complaining to them about my mother and they're this theory that you know what people do is a reflection of you [laughter] 
00:14:56	00:14:59	1	oh man had suggest 
00:14:59	00:15:16	2	that people react he was a reflection of you and what would i mentioned about my mother bugging me was affected everytime i see her or we even talk she has to comment about my clothes or what i'm wearing and and i was talking to this woman because she seemed at such a good relationship with her 
00:15:16	00:15:20	1	like her mother treated her like a human being and not a kitten 
00:15:20	00:15:28	2	and so she said reflection you know your mother's being critical you know <unk> you see that because you're critical to yourself too much 
00:15:31	00:15:38	2	yeah but this is ridiculous i mean she's never let up on that i mean it's crazy [laughter] 
00:15:38	00:15:40	1	mhm yeah 
00:15:40	00:15:54	2	i don't i mean and i think no not the last time i left him on the phone i bugged or about something else that i been trying to not take any more but then she cries [laughter] uh-huh but that doesn't work with me 
00:16:01	00:16:03	1	that's pretty tough 
00:16:03	00:16:16	2	yeah yeah i have a speaking you crying i have a colleague and american girl dancer mhm that's cool and cologne who 
00:16:16	00:16:19	1	somehow or other has fallen in love with me 
00:16:19	00:16:21	2	mhm 
00:16:27	00:16:31	1	um and thinks she's concluded that i'm abandoning or 
00:16:31	00:16:39	2	oh oh but duct here pardon in america we would say are you being stopped 
00:16:39	00:16:41	1	yeah 
00:16:41	00:16:44	2	what is your reactions to uh <unk> 
00:16:44	00:16:57	1	yeah she's i mean she's nice you know which is confusing the fact that i think that she's nice with the fact that you know she's found her made for the for the you know for the duration or whatever i don't know i mean 
00:16:57	00:17:03	2	just [noise] it's very it's very uncomfortable 
00:17:03	00:17:03	1	mhm 
00:17:03	00:17:16	2	for me and um we're going to have lunch tomorrow i'm afraid it's going to get dramatic mhm i mean that's not that far apart even still be friends here you know 
00:17:16	00:17:18	1	she doesn't want to be friends 
00:17:18	00:17:21	2	yeah [laughter] 
00:17:21	00:17:26	1	that's a problem [laughter] i don't want to be friends that can be friends with anybody 
00:17:31	00:17:32	1	each other out 
00:17:32	00:17:43	2	no no no i mean <unk> that's the thing she doesn't you know she's not content with being friends she wants to <unk> she wants to get married mhm 
00:17:43	00:17:46	1	oh wow 
00:17:46	00:17:58	2	yeah [laughter] let her huh oh are you crazy mhm said yes being nice to her you know she got confused with uh yeah 
00:17:58	00:18:03	1	so so the fact that you're moving on this other job just brings it to the <unk> 
00:18:03	00:18:08	2	right exactly she's being abandoned 
00:18:08	00:18:14	1	that was before then you would have let her know that you know she's nice and everything but 
00:18:14	00:18:15	2	oh yes 
00:18:15	00:18:18	1	friends even when you were working in the same 
00:18:18	00:18:25	2	sure yeah well i mean we've never been anything by friends mhm well i think you'll survive 
00:18:25	00:18:33	1	oh i'll survive that's for sure but you were saying you know the trick to some work with you with the computers you know that um [noise] 
00:18:33	00:18:41	2	oh the <unk> uh two years yeah so that's what i'm thinking well know what's what's coming up what's in store for me tomorrow 
00:18:41	00:18:45	1	oh i mean it's not that tears aren't tough but [noise] 
00:18:50	00:18:57	1	that's true i guess you look at them saying you're actually the other person's reaction to the situation they're not 
00:18:57	00:19:02	2	something you are doing oh right that's how she might choose 
00:19:02	00:19:05	1	react right it's it's her yes her problem 
00:19:05	00:19:11	2	[laughter] i know but you know you do want to help her with your problem 
00:19:11	00:19:14	1	right because your friends 
00:19:14	00:19:15	2	mhm 
00:19:15	00:19:16	1	can't be completely mean
