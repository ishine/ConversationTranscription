00:05:14	00:05:19	2	you're just a god yeah just everybody talking about it 
00:05:19	00:05:23	2	i think that's very peculiar way to launch from it

00:05:28	00:05:29	2	mhm 
00:05:29	00:05:31	1	anyway so what about washington area

00:05:40	00:05:41	1	<unk>

00:05:59	00:06:02	1	is that what she said no 
00:06:04	00:06:08	2	anyway so what about washing <unk> no 
00:06:08	00:06:23	1	alright washingtonians a lot more important [laughter] they said that made gate isn't national friends [laughter] so you may call made <unk> and you 
00:06:23	00:06:30	2	'cause i already cleaned up my apartment yeah but it'll get dirty again believer 
00:06:30	00:06:35	1	but i told you about how elliot cleaning it up this weekend and i 
00:06:36	00:06:38	1	but does he always wanted to 
00:06:38	00:06:48	2	no and he didn't clean it like made for what he just picked the paper awful [laughter] i i sort of had a feeling that might be the case 
00:06:48	00:06:58	1	actually cleaned up they catch on a little bit and me and got brunch salads especially good you get my masters you know um 
00:06:58	00:07:02	2	they all try and then i should know that

00:07:10	00:07:19	1	we get their new and that means you're gonna get back to a hotel and everything to of two three or four days so heavy evening one evening 
00:07:19	00:07:24	2	okay well i can do another day of the problem is that like cuts down my time in singapore

00:07:42	00:07:46	2	i play you know how those things i probably could go stand by it but the thing is 
00:07:46	00:07:51	1	it's a really pact that's the trouble <unk> 
00:07:58	00:08:03	1	and we're talking like january first and then that's when everybody goes back 
00:08:03	00:08:07	2	you're not gonna change that no no that that you mentioned the 
00:08:19	00:08:21	2	you wouldn't believe how much trouble 
00:08:28	00:08:38	1	[noise] places are full 'cause like amy <unk> was wait listed i was waiting list to get to japan and then this this woman lead tour bush 
00:08:38	00:08:45	2	you know our friend here she's trying to go to hawaii on this week and she's been trying for 
00:08:45	00:08:53	1	well that's that's uh that's japan hawaii is very crowded japanese teachers who are really apparently 
00:08:53	00:09:06	2	during that time of year doesn't matter <unk> yeah you should have her it was amazing i called every airline as you know only i can do right and i called it was with much hesitant 
00:09:06	00:09:07	1	that i called continental 
00:09:07	00:09:09	2	because i hate them you know much 
00:09:10	00:09:17	2	i was on hold for ten minutes while she figured out this route i should've known that if it took her ten minutes i should have hung up 
00:09:17	00:09:17	1	mhm 
00:09:17	00:09:25	2	[noise] she had me <unk> go from like philadelphia to new york to san francisco to l._a. to hawaii 
00:09:25	00:09:29	1	to guam to hong kong to tokyo to single 
00:09:29	00:09:35	2	i mean she asked me everywhere [laughter] 
00:09:35	00:09:37	1	three thousand dollars 
00:09:37	00:09:44	2	[laughter] oh off it takes a couple of weeks after the <unk> the only ones that 
00:09:44	00:09:48	1	[laughter] the continental 
00:09:48	00:09:56	2	that's funny [laughter] good luck can you at least go business class i don't know if i can't remember 
00:10:09	00:10:09	1	mhm 
00:10:09	00:10:11	1	they do with that 
00:10:11	00:10:18	2	yeah that's how they like to go if if i you know i could have gone specially through hong kong 
00:10:18	00:10:19	1	right 
00:10:26	00:10:28	2	yeah so 
00:10:28	00:10:30	1	miles on delta invite built the seats 
00:10:30	00:10:35	2	right well that's there actually they were going to send me on t._w._a. 
00:10:35	00:10:37	1	i thought it would be worth it to 
00:10:37	00:10:38	2	that instead of the united 'cause 
00:10:38	00:10:40	1	a few are connections 
00:10:40	00:11:01	2	instead of connecting and um well i mean it is a lot further to go through japan and all that nonsense but the problem was singapore as i have to go through new york they're j._f._k. which i now remember going from the domestic terminal too though right international and all [laughter] 
00:11:01	00:11:03	1	it's not too bad 
00:11:04	00:11:06	1	yeah no i mean that's just 
00:11:06	00:11:08	2	yeah 
00:11:08	00:11:15	1	it's not saving me much if i have to go through new york but <unk> <unk> <unk> 
00:11:15	00:11:26	2	<unk> and i have like an eight hour or five hour lay over that <unk> crazy it's not that bad by the time

00:12:14	00:12:22	2	well at least put yourself in the waiting list [noise] can you do that yeah probably but i have a feeling it's like a price thing 
00:12:22	00:12:24	1	might not be 
00:12:24	00:12:32	2	i mean if i can get it for a level but i'll tell ya well the waiting list stuff is comes through here and you know 
00:12:32	00:12:34	1	mine amy's

00:14:36	00:14:38	1	i think everything 
00:14:43	00:14:47	2	then it's fine but if you 
00:14:47	00:14:48	1	do a little shopping 
00:14:48	00:14:54	2	<unk> i mean do you like if you go to the stanley morgan that's the whole

00:15:07	00:15:19	2	[laughter] well i don't need you hey did you did two things that they've hired where can you get cheap <unk> yeah but you were there but you see <unk> 
00:15:19	00:15:27	1	okay and well that's [laughter] and do they have the medical like uh cds i haven't seen it 
00:15:27	00:15:29	2	like harris 
00:15:29	00:15:31	1	and then no that's special 
00:15:31	00:15:33	2	they would back down there [laughter] 
00:15:33	00:15:36	1	whether they're so few of those <unk> 
00:15:36	00:15:41	2	yeah oh wow i was hoping you could get me that 
00:15:41	00:15:43	1	mhm 
00:15:43	00:15:45	2	you'd have to get me a c._d. player 
00:15:45	00:15:46	1	mhm 
00:15:46	00:15:49	2	for my computer i have one for my stereo 
00:15:49	00:15:51	1	mhm 
00:15:59	00:16:00	2	'cause at home 
00:16:00	00:16:02	1	i assumed it was there 
00:16:02	00:16:07	2	uh both of them with me oh too i'm using too 
00:16:07	00:16:08	1	oh man 
00:16:08	00:16:11	2	well i need one so i can do so 
00:16:11	00:16:16	1	which uh which uh i don't get me one of these days i'm so i'm so behind them 
00:16:16	00:16:29	2	[noise] i'm so don't need it because i use my computer and like using warm perfect six and forgetting how to use it now i'm typing up <unk> they had that and so now i'm 
00:16:29	00:16:32	1	they get a cat because you can remember how to do 
00:16:38	00:16:42	2	because when i get home at eleven o'clock at night and i have to prepare 
00:16:42	00:16:44	1	presentation for the morning 
00:16:44	00:16:54	2	if i write notes i can't read them [laughter] i'm so tired i cannot physically right so everybody laughs at me they think i'm the most anal person with my typed up notes up 
00:16:57	00:17:06	2	although i did that with my <unk> with lesson plans and stuff uh-huh <unk> much better and it's really a lot easier 
00:17:06	00:17:11	1	and then if you need to you know if you need to get them corrected it than they do come out looking too 
00:17:11	00:17:14	2	right well they but they come out 
00:17:17	00:17:32	2	physically that to ride it except that involves like turning on the computer and like actually making the move over to my desk as opposed to sitting on the floor that's difficult [laughter] no i definitely think it's easier i <unk> i was i did a lot of that and i i agree with you in 
00:17:32	00:17:35	1	also and then when i said i can make uh 
00:17:35	00:17:42	2	and can you make a make <unk> you know so that it looks so i mean if [noise] 'cause i did i well 
00:17:42	00:17:51	1	and what you're doing when it's nuts for a presentation i don't need the macro when it's doing my history in physicals to handed and you don't think i just 
00:17:51	00:17:56	2	pull up my last physical exam and changed the <unk> the positive 
00:17:56	00:18:00	1	that's weird we did <unk> i mean we didn't mind the hospital 
00:18:00	00:18:08	2	well it's there are different for like other of services for surgery and dying and stuff like that 
00:18:08	00:18:11	1	i remember i remember hearing the men i remember 
00:18:11	00:18:15	2	<unk> but that's because you didn't have computers dad 
00:18:15	00:18:17	2	oh okay 
00:18:17	00:18:20	1	what's the difference whether you sit down in the hospital and do it or do it on your <unk>
