00:05:39	00:05:41	1	or something like that 
00:05:41	00:05:49	2	um 'cause september is pretty much the <unk> one of the slowest months on the job so and i haven't been to texas in a while 
00:05:49	00:05:51	1	so i thought that would work out and 
00:05:51	00:06:04	2	um then at christmas time i think two of my <unk> well one of my cousins um is getting married near kansas city and i'm hoping my family will just come up to kansas for that mhm and then i'll go there and see them 
00:06:04	00:06:06	1	i don't know about thanksgiving yet 
00:06:06	00:06:12	2	that's too far away [laughter] to figure out so anyway i will 
00:06:12	00:06:14	1	are you happy 
00:06:14	00:06:21	2	yeah i like it was really hard to make the decision i actually at one point decided no i'm not going to go 
00:06:21	00:06:22	1	right 
00:06:29	00:06:33	1	i called in and told the director you know i thought about it a lot 
00:06:33	00:06:43	2	blah blah blah but i just don't think it's right for me right now and mhm he was like i i don't know him very well but ah he'd he'd had 
00:06:43	00:06:46	1	strep throat when i was here i mean he was wasn't feeling well 
00:06:46	00:06:49	2	mhm okay and uh 
00:06:49	00:06:54	1	later that morning cake called me at work and in omaha 
00:06:54	00:06:59	2	cater you claim to make this really hard on me she's like we just want you to think about 
00:06:59	00:07:00	1	thing and 
00:07:00	00:07:03	2	the job is supposed to be at a two year commitment 
00:07:03	00:07:04	1	uh-huh but 
00:07:04	00:07:16	2	and that was kind of like one of the things that i'm thinking i don't know about doing it to your commitment and you know all this sort of said it was too long or that it well sure no i mean it could be longer so it's not like it was too short who's just right 
00:07:16	00:07:17	1	i don't know 
00:07:17	00:07:21	2	i don't know what i was thinking but anyway so they're like what if it was just a one year commitment 
00:07:29	00:07:31	2	i said well would you 
00:07:31	00:07:32	1	willing 
00:07:32	00:07:33	2	a first year 
00:07:33	00:07:38	1	um area director makes seventeen thousand in the second year every director makes eighteen thousand five hundred 
00:07:38	00:07:40	2	first or you get three weeks vacation second 
00:07:40	00:07:42	1	you get four weeks and i said well 
00:07:42	00:07:56	2	would you be willing to hire me as if i was coming into the second year um at eighteen five with four weeks of vacation and he said yeah he he would be willing to do that wow that's a lot of fish yeah it is which is wonderful [laughter] 
00:07:56	00:08:01	1	mm that's more important to me the money right yeah so we take we get the whole week 
00:08:01	00:08:06	2	<unk> christmas dinner your that's one of our weeks of vacation so it don't you know in addition to that so 
00:08:25	00:08:26	1	mhm 
00:08:26	00:08:27	2	mhm 
00:08:27	00:08:28	1	so i i thought about that day and 
00:08:28	00:08:38	2	calling back and saying okay i'm coming to detroit so it's been really good since i've actually i made the decision i thought oh god what am i doing you know i i just 
00:08:38	00:08:39	1	it was 
00:08:39	00:08:41	2	still unsure about it but within a couple of days i just 
00:08:41	00:08:42	1	it's not really at peace with it 
00:08:42	00:08:46	2	and remain so throughout the time but i prepared to 
00:08:46	00:08:47	1	leave and then 
00:08:47	00:08:54	2	ever since i've been here i keep thinking okay why am i so okay with this i'm going to be falling apart any minute right 
00:08:54	00:08:55	1	[laughter] 
00:08:55	00:09:05	2	use the transition hitting me a little bit harder especially way though ambivalent about the decision but um i don't know it's been great so yeah right 
00:09:05	00:09:06	1	no question it 
00:09:51	00:09:52	1	uh cab 
00:09:52	00:10:01	2	to the metropolitan museum of art ran around there for an hour and a half to a cab back and then the train back to long island so all we saw um and i liked that 
00:10:01	00:10:03	1	but it just it didn't even feel like i had to 
00:10:03	00:10:08	2	you been in the city you know mhm so um so this was more like you know 
00:10:08	00:10:13	1	if we did a lot of the the tourists do stuff and watching the brooklyn bridge and 
00:10:13	00:10:17	2	mhm the ferry and um walked in central park and 
00:10:17	00:10:20	1	went to a show and all that sort of stuff so it was really fun 
00:10:20	00:10:21	2	[noise] um 
00:10:21	00:10:24	1	and we also went out to long island where 
00:10:24	00:10:26	2	his mom lives uh-huh 
00:10:26	00:10:32	1	and spend time with the whole family [laughter] well which was okay it was good 
00:10:32	00:10:39	2	[noise] it first when we were planning a trip he had he was like oh i hope we can go out and you know go to the beach and you can 
00:10:39	00:10:41	1	meet my my brother and my nieces and nephews 
00:10:41	00:10:44	2	four brothers three brothers 
00:10:44	00:10:52	1	um two of them live on long island you know my brothers and my nieces and nephews and i'm like um i don't know i don't i thought i i think maybe we need time just to 
00:10:52	00:10:58	2	kind of figure out where our relationship is mhm if it's not that i don't want to be your family it's just 
00:10:58	00:10:59	1	mhm 
00:10:59	00:11:01	2	i don't know a lot of his mom too and i think she 
00:11:01	00:11:03	1	a little bit leery of this whole relation 
00:11:03	00:11:10	2	based on what happened in the past you know and i heard her son and all that sort of thing i'm like i just don't know if i'm ready for that and 
00:11:10	00:11:14	1	but it it ended up happening that it was his brother's birthday and we were out there to go to the beach and it's 
00:11:14	00:11:25	2	so i'm like okay we can you know i can handle this and uh it was very nice actually so that was fine and uh so we're to thing and up 
00:11:25	00:11:27	1	i don't know vic um 
00:11:27	00:11:37	2	it was really fun and i mean in some ways joe somebody i've known a long time and i know pretty well but in other ways of like this is a whole new relation 
00:11:37	00:11:39	1	ship mhm so it's 
00:11:39	00:11:46	2	it's kind of weird to walk that balance like you know one minute we're talking seriously like where would we live if we wanted to be together 
00:11:46	00:11:48	1	and then you know i'm like 
00:11:48	00:12:02	2	and i can't believe we're talking about this what are you doing now he's in his last year of graduate school at columbia university it's getting his masters in public administration uh-huh and he's been working with this man who's starting in uh new non profit organization 
00:12:04	00:12:08	2	he worked with him last summer in the summer and probably will work with him during the school 
00:12:08	00:12:10	1	yeah that 
00:12:10	00:12:17	2	i don't he doesn't know what he's going to do you know but it's you know it's kind of hard because i have open he might want to 
00:12:36	00:12:45	1	yeah so what do we do you know do we make decisions based on each other i mean it's just the second we can resolve seen each other so he's coming here 
00:12:45	00:12:53	2	labor day weekend and then because my schedule gets so crazy starting it in the middle middle of october i'm going to 
00:12:54	00:12:58	2	they're the first week of october that was kind of hard for us to decide 
00:12:58	00:13:00	1	you know he hasn't even been here yet i haven't seen him since 
00:13:00	00:13:08	2	fourth of july weekend and and we decided well you know how it goes but how do you plan that if you don't know how it's going to go 
00:13:08	00:13:13	1	actually i'm like well i wonder if i wanted to wait until after labor day to make the next step i said when the other hand 
00:13:13	00:13:19	2	there's a fair we're going on right now and this was the only weekend that i have been 'til after thanksgiving you know and i write like if we're going to try to do this 
00:13:20	00:13:27	2	i i don't think i could go from labor day until december you know it doesn't make sense to me he's like yeah 
00:13:27	00:13:34	1	okay well let's let's do it and i oh it was it was weird you know i felt bad even bring it up because i was doing the counter thinking oh my god you know 
00:13:34	00:13:35	2	mhm 
00:13:35	00:13:37	1	so so we talk on the scale 
00:13:37	00:13:42	2	um so i mean that's exciting <unk> and in a way it's good 
00:13:42	00:13:48	1	i mean that you are both at stages while i mean you just kind of took on uh no you ended up taking on a one year commitment right 
00:13:48	00:13:57	2	yeah and i think that was part of my thing but i mean if you're not going to do this two years long distance ugh right hate i mean i hate the one year 
00:14:08	00:14:11	1	and be like right right 
00:14:11	00:14:14	2	i don't know i'm just i'm 
00:14:14	00:14:15	1	mhm 
00:14:15	00:14:19	2	the phone calls are okay but i just feel like what are we doing and 
00:14:19	00:14:26	1	i'm really anxious for him to get here um two weeks and it just seems more real and were able to be together and talk about things 
00:14:26	00:14:29	2	course you know uh stayed in the face yeah 
00:14:29	00:14:31	1	so i think we're both <unk> sort of feeling 
00:14:31	00:14:37	2	is this real what are we doing and so i'm i don't know that i don't know what's happening but 
00:14:37	00:14:40	1	oh i would i be laughed at least there's a price 
00:14:40	00:14:50	2	i mean if biting yeah but i don't feel like all my hopes are tied up in that and that's good you know right i mean i'm happy wearing that and other things in my life or goods 
00:14:50	00:14:52	1	good i'm glad 
00:14:52	00:14:55	2	what about you and the secret policemen [laughter] oh 
00:14:55	00:14:58	1	gosh well that's nice 
00:15:06	00:15:07	1	wow 
00:15:07	00:15:12	2	it's been really hard on me because i just you know i have so many 
00:15:16	00:15:22	2	went out the window when this all happened because when i met him i really i didn't know he was married i think i told you 
00:15:23	00:15:26	2	you like them but you didn't know that much about him and right 
00:15:26	00:15:35	1	went out a couple of times and like the second time was until the second time that i found out that he was married and he's still didn't tell me that it is actually at that time his wife is pregnant 
00:15:35	00:15:37	2	and he didn't tell me but he said a lot 
00:15:37	00:15:39	1	things to me that you know they 
00:15:39	00:15:42	2	and eight years you've never been tempted before and he didn't 
00:15:42	00:15:55	1	and but yeah i was really attracted me and all this kind of stuff and i was still like there is no way i'm getting involved with a married man but i still had feelings for him and i thought that they would just die once i got the confirmation that he was really married you know 'cause i think that's 
00:15:55	00:16:00	2	dread suspected right but i wasn't sure and when i finally found 
00:16:14	00:16:15	1	mhm <unk> 
00:16:15	00:16:17	2	hard with it you know once you have 
00:16:26	00:16:27	1	exactly 
00:16:27	00:16:32	2	and so um i think what to do with you and i hadn't heard about it 
00:16:32	00:16:33	1	uh-huh 
00:16:33	00:16:39	2	we can and he called me again and federal you know let's have lunch and so we had lunch and 
00:16:39	00:16:41	1	talk to and it was so 
00:16:41	00:16:56	2	really there was still like a lot of you know you would say things mean complement me and kind of alert you know and that was still there and so it was very uncomfortable with it when he went to drop me off he took my hand might just take my hand but he kind of held onto it mhm and maybe 
00:16:56	00:16:57	1	really uncomfortable and 
00:16:57	00:17:05	2	so he was like well i'll leave it up to you you know give me a call if you want to go out and have a drink or something like that you know whatever i didn't call um i just felt 
00:17:05	00:17:12	1	who was like uncomfortable and gonna be weird so 
00:17:12	00:17:25	2	two weeks after that which was just this past week um became to interpol for something and he called me from inside the building they were doing some dirty attack or something like that [noise] and it was like i just you know 
00:17:25	00:17:26	1	say hi and 
00:17:31	00:17:37	1	[laughter] i hear from you goodbye so that night i went to do some shopping and it's i'm walking home 
00:17:37	00:17:42	2	my apartment all of a sudden they see this car pull up in a town 
00:17:42	00:17:44	1	and he was like wild 
00:17:52	00:17:54	1	and he was like oh you didn't call 
00:17:54	00:17:58	2	oh i wondered if you just didn't want to see any any more i thought maybe at least you just call the telling me that and 
00:18:04	00:18:06	2	have a drink whatever and talk about this 'cause i had 
00:18:06	00:18:10	1	through a lot of strange feelings about it and you know i thought well 
00:18:10	00:18:18	2	we can talk about it a little mistake he comes up to my apartment with me and he's like well you know 
00:18:18	00:18:20	1	have a glass of water 
00:18:20	00:18:29	2	like that here and i'm just going to stay for a couple of minutes 'cause i was on my way home well one thing turns into another pulling my hand he kisses me was 
00:18:49	00:18:50	1	[laughter] oh 
00:18:50	00:18:59	2	awful and i've been beating myself up about it ever since and anyway so he finally left and i mean i think it was kind of hard for him 
00:18:59	00:19:00	1	mhm 
00:19:10	00:19:19	2	i think we need to talk about this or we came to meet me for lunch at work and you know nothing happened i mean nothing physical whatever we didn't even boxing both kinda came to the conclusion that 
00:19:19	00:19:21	1	we would probably be too difficult for us 
00:19:21	00:19:26	2	be friends or you know at least if we were going to we needed a long break 
00:19:29	00:19:34	2	and talk and talk it's not just you know physical physical and i i really 
00:19:34	00:19:36	1	would love to have him as a friend 
00:19:36	00:19:40	2	but since i had those feelings and then i kinda got all caught up in it 
00:19:40	00:19:42	1	right 
00:20:17	00:20:19	1	oh yeah i'm vicky 
00:20:19	00:20:32	2	easy to say i just assumed that all my <unk> once i found out that he was really married i thought oh okay fine you know hands off like that's usually how it is right but that was weird i still had feeling forum and 
00:20:32	00:20:32	1	[noise] 
00:20:32	00:20:39	2	so hard for me to i mean here i haven't been interested in anybody touched down and it's just so hard for me to get over that of course 
00:20:39	00:20:43	1	first person it interests that i'm you know that i feel something for 
00:21:02	00:21:11	2	i feel good about that but in a way angie i mean he was the one that last i mean he he really could struggle with i struggled with that i could tell but he was the one that 
00:21:11	00:21:12	1	got up to 
00:21:12	00:21:14	2	and i'm not sure that i would have 
00:21:14	00:21:17	1	i mean i wish i had to insisted 
00:21:17	00:21:23	2	like when it first happened and when he when he put my hand and it started getting more you know kind of tender i i should 
00:21:23	00:21:24	1	just bad luck i 
00:21:24	00:21:31	2	need to leave now and i wasn't the one to do it he was the one that got up and walked away and i i just feel so guilty about that 
00:21:31	00:21:41	1	i heard i mean it's it's hard when you have feelings for someone and they and the wind starts to get blurred you know and and they're being tender towards view but 
00:21:41	00:22:00	2	he's not like i was so strong because the first week after you know the first time in the car when he he held my hand and and said well leave it up to you you decide if you wanna call mhm the first week after that was really hard for me because i was tempted you know i'm like gosh do i <unk> i try to make a friendship work is a really nice guy i really like it you know but i just 
00:22:00	00:22:04	1	just so wrong and i knew it was going to end up 
00:22:04	00:22:08	2	yeah something was going to happen i could just tell you can tell by the way he was looking at me i could 
00:22:08	00:22:08	1	wow 
00:22:08	00:22:10	2	uh by a lot of things 
00:22:10	00:22:18	1	and so i got past that first week you know and then the second week i've thought about um a little bit but it was getting better i was getting over it and i was almost forgetting and 
00:22:26	00:22:43	2	it's weird really weird i dreamed about him in one of those dreams where it's like really strong yeah and it's weird it reminds me of that i dreamed about basketball one time before he called the blue like i hadn't heard about him mhm 
00:22:48	00:22:55	2	to like um uh cold stuff but like um 
00:22:55	00:22:57	1	i mean a catering with 
00:22:57	00:23:02	2	mhm with people that are dead i don't know all this i was really interesting but anyway we went out with them last night and talked about it 
00:23:02	00:23:07	1	they decided that i have ah i'm receptive you reason i could be a medium 
00:23:07	00:23:10	2	oh [laughter] are you going to try 
00:23:10	00:23:13	1	mm no kind of freaks me out but anyway 
00:23:21	00:23:29	1	i don't know i think there's more to the way we're all connected than than we admit in our daily lives and sometimes are so conscious 
00:23:52	00:23:56	2	i'm not sure i wondered about that when i'm really not sure but 
00:23:56	00:24:01	1	strange thing is he couldn't have known i i did gross i went to we're on the way home it wasn't like 
00:24:01	00:24:03	2	i mean he could yes that i 
00:24:03	00:24:08	1	at five fifteen but he has no way of really knowing when i leave the office and then i went and did some shopping and it was like 
00:24:08	00:24:09	2	twenty seven 
00:24:09	00:24:12	1	no i mean if you had to you would have had it in 
00:24:12	00:24:15	2	i had my apartment sticking in 
00:24:15	00:24:20	1	he drove up it was like he was driving down the street he wasn't parked in front of my 
00:24:26	00:24:33	1	somewhere [laughter] and it was weird because i had seen him at work that day i mean i didn't see him but he called me 
00:25:00	00:25:02	1	yeah 
00:25:02	00:25:05	2	right 
00:25:05	00:25:08	1	this'll this'll be the end i mean do you have a sense that 
00:25:08	00:25:16	2	which seems like i feel like i know that i could call him and i've been really tempted i mean even like friday of pollen i feel like i want to talk to him 
00:25:16	00:25:23	1	you know what i'm like making deals with myself i'm like well if we just talk on the phone and we don't see each other maybe we can do that and you know then started 
00:25:23	00:25:32	2	i i started well no that means but not right close it you know 
00:25:32	00:25:33	1	is this is the first time 
00:25:33	00:25:45	2	yeah and that's what one of the conversations that we had was um before this incident happened in my apartment but was nice that you know 
00:25:45	00:25:48	1	i don't want you to take the wrong way but 
00:25:48	00:25:52	2	i think that a lot of this has to do with the fact that you're just going through a lot of change 
00:25:52	00:25:53	1	right 
00:25:53	00:26:01	2	having a child i mean that's gotta be wow and i mean i didn't say this but i kind of in any way to that but i'm sure he hadn't had sex with his wife and you know 
00:26:01	00:26:05	1	mines and so that might be like a factor 
00:26:05	00:26:10	2	you know i think it was the timing and well and there's and he was like no no no that's 
00:26:10	00:26:16	1	true i respect you waste much to let you you know you're you say that i don't but then i think later he realized that that had to 
00:26:16	00:26:31	2	part of that is true i mean it doesn't say anything less about you i mean you're still in attractive person someone that they might not looming another time and place but circumstances maybe made him more open to letting his mind go with this exactly time 
00:26:44	00:26:53	1	i asked the question so it was like would he have told me you know when would have told me what if i would've and i mean he admitted 
00:26:53	00:26:56	2	yeah i guess i just wanted to know 
00:26:56	00:26:58	1	spend some time 
00:26:58	00:27:07	2	with you and get to know you and i wasn't thinking about you know by marriage or whatever talking to you about that 'cause it didn't seem like it fit into what i want it i want i think he kind of wanted to keep it for him so 
00:27:07	00:27:20	1	you know what i mean like when you find a new friend or you meet somebody that you're kind of interested in and maybe he had these feelings didn't understand why he was interested in me and so he just decided well if i tell her i'm married and i share off 
00:27:20	00:27:23	2	yeah that's that's understandable but i think 
00:27:25	00:27:28	2	i think it's very dangerous that's why i say god 
00:27:28	00:27:30	1	it's been that were rings 
00:27:30	00:27:32	2	you'd know doesn't want to go anywhere 
00:27:32	00:27:34	1	it's not all frenchmen i mean [laughter] 
00:27:47	00:27:48	1	mhm 
00:27:48	00:27:55	2	you know the largest one of the top right there yeah we have a lot of my feelings to go any further because i would have been totally <unk> 
00:27:55	00:27:57	1	oh vicky 
00:27:57	00:28:01	2	i know um so i mean it's just 
00:28:01	00:28:03	1	really upset me 'cause i'm like this 
00:28:03	00:28:13	2	oh joke that god is playing on me the first person that i even so any felt any interest in that style and unavailable 
00:28:13	00:28:14	1	uh-huh yeah 
00:28:14	00:28:17	2	hard and i feel so guilty 
00:28:17	00:28:18	1	mhm 
00:28:18	00:28:36	2	it just let it go and you don't have any reason to be guilty at all i think that i mean you trade your best and i mean okay maybe a hundred percent perfectly strong and <unk> totally pure person wouldn't you know i don't know ten years older than you are 
00:28:45	00:28:54	2	i mean i know that feeling come they would have regretted it so much i i mean if i'm regretting it this much now it's or you know just citizen you imagine if i were at my god 
00:28:54	00:28:55	1	yeah 
00:28:55	00:28:57	2	and you didn't i mean that's good 
00:28:57	00:29:08	1	yeah but not necessarily because of me i don't know if i would have been strong enough but then sometimes i think if it would have gone much further i uh i couldn't have i mean because they told me i can say i would have been repulsed yeah 
00:29:24	00:29:32	2	i don't know but before before i saw on this last time after the first time you know when we had lunch helping hand and everything 
00:29:32	00:29:34	1	[noise] she said well 
00:29:34	00:29:41	2	maybe um i said to him you know maybe this would be easier for me 'cause i admitted to him that it was difficult 
00:29:41	00:29:42	1	that i 
00:29:42	00:29:55	2	when i found out he was married that i thought you know all these feelings would go away and it really happened that way and he was saying the exact same thing to me and like yeah i really really struggled with just imagine after i had no my wife had her baby he's like i just 
00:29:55	00:29:56	1	yeah
