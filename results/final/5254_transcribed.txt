00:06:50	00:06:52	1	anyway um 
00:06:52	00:07:02	2	so it was kind of upsetting because i had hoped that we could do some other fun things together we didn't take <unk> we don't have the time we don't have the money and you know turn the heat 
00:07:02	00:07:03	1	i want to spend any time alone with me

00:07:34	00:07:37	1	mhm and as soon as i sit down and do it with him 
00:07:37	00:07:45	2	anyway so we didn't spend any time together and then we went to england and his parents were really mean to me

00:07:46	00:07:53	2	<unk> well because we split up i need to earn my way back to the family they say it's understandable that they should be angry with me

00:08:03	00:08:04	2	mhm

00:08:07	00:08:08	2	yeah 
00:08:08	00:08:10	1	why are his parents punishing me 
00:08:10	00:08:13	2	they were really dreadful and then

00:08:23	00:08:25	2	you go do that you know 
00:08:25	00:08:26	1	and they treat you like shit and they <unk> 
00:08:26	00:08:41	2	and when it was very upsetting and based in stand up for me [noise] you know what i mean mhm and then afterwards it was very upset and he didn't you know say oh they were wrong to treat you that way you know nothing like that 
00:08:41	00:08:43	1	what was his reason 
00:08:43	00:08:52	2	right i mean what it says well they're mad at you and you know i mean he says it like you know because he's english so he doesn't spell it all out you know but he says it in leaves it open for me 
00:08:52	00:08:54	1	for that he agrees with them 
00:08:54	00:09:00	2	and then he doesn't contradict it you know and they say do you agree with them and he doesn't say anything you know like i like 
00:09:00	00:09:01	1	then um 
00:09:01	00:09:12	2	[noise] so they're coming for three weeks i'm supposed to spend christmas my christmas vacation in texas with them and they're going for three weeks the only time that we both have three 
00:09:12	00:09:13	1	mhm 
00:09:13	00:09:25	2	it's like he just ignores me when we were around them and i ended up three of the days we were there he and his brother and his father sat and watched cricket all day and i had to like clean the house and do the cooking and watch them 
00:09:25	00:09:28	1	mhm you know it's incredible 
00:09:28	00:09:37	2	and this is my only vacation <unk> spent my christmas vacation which is the only time i'm going to get to see him yeah with them and i said i can't do it 
00:09:42	00:09:48	2	they had him to come up for christmas so we could all be together for christmas and i just i just can't 
00:09:48	00:09:50	1	be with them every time

00:10:00	00:10:00	1	mhm 
00:10:00	00:10:14	2	love them and the fact that they could turn on me like that shouldn't be that they never really cared about me they obviously never proved me or why would they be treated me like the nationwide all happy that we are back together right yeah but it's probably the 
00:10:22	00:10:28	2	i know i know but it just really hurt that they could i'm sure like that i mean i think that they should have seen that 
00:10:28	00:10:33	1	you know maybe this was nobody's fault maybe it was both of our faults and certainly they should be 
00:10:33	00:10:37	2	happy for all of us that we're together as young <unk> and do you have to talk on me 
00:10:48	00:10:51	1	yeah yeah but meanwhile cold like ice

00:11:10	00:11:16	1	be doing things to help keep me from getting so bad you know mhm but he doesn't have to 
00:11:16	00:11:25	2	and the only thing i think he really wanted me to feel bad he really wanted me to be punished mhm you know and and what did i do i mean i was the one that got us back together 
00:11:25	00:11:31	1	bend over backwards to make the relationship work i've done everything he said i was doing one that was keeping him from being happy
