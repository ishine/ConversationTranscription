00:17:17	00:17:18	1	yeah 
00:17:18	00:17:26	2	who i know who did not no that's okay but i mean this they weren't serious at this point so kind of really 
00:17:26	00:17:28	1	and he was drunk anyway 
00:17:28	00:17:31	2	[noise] so basically i signed on they ended up talking the whole night because 
00:17:40	00:17:43	1	so i didn't get to see him for the rest of the night when i found out like 
00:17:43	00:17:49	2	when he kissed me and i found out he had a girlfriend of course i started getting interested i started liking him okay 
00:17:49	00:17:50	1	uh-huh 
00:17:50	00:17:59	2	right now at this point it's it's normal school and i'm interested in 'em and i find that he likes me still it's just that he can't decide between me 
00:18:01	00:18:11	2	uh aaron edwards i think you might not yeah so familiar you probably know she's <unk> she's a bitch i think so 
00:18:20	00:18:36	2	do i think you might [noise] so [noise] okay so that's that is just gay and i was annoyed and he's telling me oh he's interested me but he doesn't want her to school or whatever so he's basically leading me on keeping me like they're saying all because 
00:18:36	00:18:38	1	yeah and then 
00:18:38	00:18:46	2	ben aaron and <unk> get more serious i guess cause they on lots of fights but he's decides to stay with her and from the mean time will be 
00:18:46	00:18:52	1	okay i was like whatever you know he's the one that started liking me first i'm not going to like be 
00:18:52	00:18:54	2	devastated well 
00:18:55	00:19:07	2	talk and stuff like that but it turns out like i haven't seen him for us to decide i went over and we both got high and wrong and okay the whole time he's like holly 
00:19:07	00:19:10	1	i really have such feelings for you blah blah blah blah blah
