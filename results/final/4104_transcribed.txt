00:02:36	00:02:39	2	right well what happens to your work 
00:02:39	00:02:43	1	i just won't do it but i mean if i have to pay you know

00:02:49	00:02:53	1	he's big word <unk> they're making you use the word 
00:02:53	00:03:01	2	[noise] is that what it is [laughter] <unk> better uh-huh [laughter] that's the purpose 
00:03:01	00:03:02	1	uh-huh 
00:03:05	00:03:17	2	[noise] so um well you know that that would be the the thing i mean there's no way i'm sure you're not gonna get back 
00:03:17	00:03:18	1	uh 
00:03:18	00:03:27	2	you know within a day or two of the time you know 'cause they're eighteen hundred flights that uh they go back 
00:03:27	00:03:29	1	oh not an american 
00:03:29	00:03:31	2	oh in america 
00:03:32	00:03:35	1	on america they'd go from london 
00:03:35	00:03:38	2	oh this is a flight to london 
00:03:38	00:03:41	1	right right and i just 
00:03:41	00:03:44	2	get the uh connecting flight 
00:03:44	00:03:46	1	can you get me a connecting flight 
00:03:46	00:03:48	2	well that shouldn't be a problem

00:04:00	00:04:09	1	yeah but nothing as possible [laughter] you know who doesn't have to take it a month ago is not going to fly up the rest of the year 
00:04:09	00:04:13	2	so you don't want a ticket to milan for nine hundred dollars 
00:04:13	00:04:17	1	but again that's the point i mean if it's gonna make calls 
00:04:17	00:04:20	2	[noise] um 
00:04:20	00:04:23	1	it's easier for me just to get show was then
