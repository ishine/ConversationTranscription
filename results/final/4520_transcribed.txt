00:00:00	00:00:02	2	well i used to be a teacher 
00:00:02	00:00:03	1	mhm mhm 
00:00:03	00:00:09	2	and i think there are many things wrong with the public school system and that's why i got out of teaching 
00:00:09	00:00:13	1	what uh what they were the problems that you found in a public school system 
00:00:13	00:00:34	2	[noise] well [noise] um i think the main problem is there's just not enough discipline and the classes are too big because um kids to get away with too much and there's not really that much that a teacher can do 
00:00:34	00:00:43	1	because um the administration is worried about the big problems about um you know 
00:00:43	00:00:46	2	kids bringing guns to school yeah 
00:00:46	00:00:50	1	they don't have time to worry about the the problems of 
00:00:50	00:00:54	2	[noise] of maintenance meant that they used to be able to worry about 
00:00:54	00:01:01	1	well i think the problem is that uh if you start considering yourself more with discipline i think um 
00:01:01	00:01:02	2	i think teachers main goals should be 
00:01:02	00:01:11	1	[noise] more instead of worried about this one is getting to students or you know kids interested in learning because as i can recall when i went to go to school 
00:01:11	00:01:13	2	cool um 
00:01:13	00:01:16	1	most of the teachers were just basically banned 
00:01:16	00:01:19	2	either try to discipline you and then force you to go through this material 
00:01:19	00:01:21	1	show no really 
00:01:21	00:01:26	2	<unk> i mean into making that interesting or fun fun in school 
00:01:33	00:01:35	1	i don't know 
00:01:35	00:01:42	2	this might not be in your case but at least where i went to school um superiority complex where they had to be always more intelligent than their students 
00:01:42	00:01:46	1	soon as possible for students they felt more intimidated 
00:01:46	00:01:53	2	when um people would ask questions that they didn't understand themselves then rather than doing those thirty there 
00:01:53	00:01:55	1	you know ridicule is doing or tell them to shut up 
00:01:55	00:02:12	2	or you know this is not what we are covering we're doing this and so certain kids who would be interested in exploring different avenues where just basically shunted because you know <unk> you know they're all more concerned that everybody falls along a certain path although i agree that this plane is uh important 
00:02:15	00:02:19	2	there are in different areas where kids are already grown too 
00:02:19	00:02:21	1	uh point of rebellion or guns 
00:02:21	00:02:35	2	as you mentioned but uh in general uh certain areas i think if if if they started earlier maybe not in just the high school level but i mean the elementary school maybe you have to worry about [noise] switch blade instead of guns um 
00:02:35	00:02:37	1	that the 
00:02:37	00:02:42	2	students would you know if the teacher's got kids interested in more into learning rather than bickering 
00:02:42	00:02:43	1	uh lemonade 
00:02:43	00:03:00	2	pseudo rebel rules that are created because you know if the teacher says don't do this and then kids do it especially that age they want to be a rebel so there are different they prove themselves by you know um uh going against establishment type of thing uh what do you think 
00:03:00	00:03:01	1	[noise] 
00:03:01	00:03:11	2	well i think the problem with that the problem i had because when i went into teaching i decided i was just going to be you know the <unk> creative teacher 
00:03:11	00:03:12	1	[noise] and 
00:03:12	00:03:16	2	um my kids working as a saint that learning was fun 
00:03:16	00:03:18	1	well <unk> 
00:03:18	00:03:30	2	oh this teach an eighth grade or guns or the local too yeah [laughter] okay [laughter] north carolina well this is in south carolina okay 
00:03:30	00:03:33	1	but anyway the problem that i had 
00:03:33	00:03:40	2	was um my students didn't really know how to respond to that mhm 
00:03:40	00:03:40	1	mhm 
00:03:40	00:03:45	2	and they basically didn't 
00:03:45	00:03:51	1	they didn't appreciate everything i was trying to do for him because i would have learning games 
00:03:51	00:03:52	2	all the time 
00:03:52	00:03:54	1	and i tried to date just bond 
00:03:54	00:03:55	2	<unk> 
00:03:55	00:04:00	1	and make it interesting and the creative thinking and 
00:04:00	00:04:07	2	just all kinds of things and they just took advantage of me and i walked all over me and i was never 
00:04:07	00:04:14	2	[noise] able to establish any kind of discipline because i started out being too nice 
00:04:14	00:04:23	1	really do you think the problem might have originated at an earlier stage that maybe kids weren't really taught much to respect you know teachers and also try it 
00:04:23	00:04:32	2	that's the thing is i don't think that they do respect teachers and i'm saying that that that will just the administration in my school didn't give me any support 
00:04:37	00:04:55	2	taking advantage of me <unk> um they just told me they would just crack down and then they wouldn't support me in that and they just told me that the only way that they students would respond would be if i had a completely stretch and environment and i was miserable 
00:04:55	00:04:57	1	[noise] doing that
