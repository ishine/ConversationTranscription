00:14:50	00:14:53	1	you know salary but there must be 
00:14:53	00:15:05	2	<unk> pressure and israel because that was your sister in law in outside of <unk> who's got this real job has not been told that she has to get a masters degree well yeah masters now ah ah but she didn't need university

00:15:25	00:15:32	1	and that you saw it but i mean for her it's it's not like america you can go for a year i mean it's a real struggle to get a masters in israel 
00:15:32	00:15:43	2	is is you know it's just that you already got a family 'cause it's not like in the states and you do you're a b._a. in your masters and then you get married and then you know exactly that and i 
00:15:43	00:15:45	1	this is for my masters 
00:15:45	00:15:51	2	yeah that's my problem also to a doctor they have to do with um wait a minute and so you mean they know you didn't do
