00:14:12	00:14:18	2	some of it and i'm going to get my mother to pay for some of it and you know he'll think that's 
00:14:18	00:14:26	1	yeah i mean and i think you know in the end he's perfectly willing to pay for the majority of it but he doesn't wanna feel like it's my mother yet again sticking my father with uh 
00:14:26	00:14:37	2	right you know what i mean mhm and that seems to be your life goal [laughter] the politics you get like get more money out of her and it's like no no i don't need to be a part of that 
00:14:37	00:14:41	1	i mean one thing i guess my cousins are lucky about is that they're boys 
00:14:41	00:14:50	2	so that at least their weddings they will not have to deal with their mother and father bickering over like money god knows what's going to have one to go to college 
00:14:51	00:14:59	2	i mean for a while she decided she wanted to send them to private school right that was fun 'cause my uncle's like this is stupid why wouldn't she'll be seven the pilots 
00:14:59	00:15:01	1	but like high school and stuff yeah

00:15:37	00:15:43	1	younger they sent daniel the therapy they did not sunday because i said he was too young what a seat notice

00:15:49	00:15:51	1	uh he's had to deal with so much 
00:15:51	00:16:00	2	shit from them since then you know what i mean like he still has to deal with so much stuff like my my uncle is like an idiot my <unk> my ex on it's a complete

00:16:36	00:16:43	1	he's such a fussy baby which is not true gabriel's actually a pretty quiet people's baby as babies you know mhm 
00:16:43	00:16:56	2	so she was just <unk> you know and and like gene was going to take him she took me out to a t. for my birthday and she was going to bring daniel david and of course daniel you know he's fourteen so he had to go hang out with his friends because he's in high school now right right yeah 
00:16:56	00:17:03	1	david wanted to go and he was like he thought it would be actually he thought it was like going to be really cool because it would be like kind of this fancy place 
00:17:03	00:17:06	2	right uh yeah and and 
00:17:06	00:17:18	1	mothers and he comes back and he says i don't want to go with can be boring in any way i have to go to a mom's on friday which is like he's goes friday night to eugene south so he had to go to us mothers and then go to <unk> 
00:17:18	00:17:19	2	mhm 
00:17:19	00:17:21	1	he's like i have to go to mom's on 
00:17:21	00:17:22	2	after school 
00:17:22	00:17:25	1	[noise] yeah i mean it's 
00:17:25	00:17:29	2	a shame like i don't know what the hell's you've seen them in eugene it's just an idiot 
00:17:29	00:17:40	1	eugene does not like never was as close with david us he was with daniel <unk> he's always like like i said that to jeanie and she was just like well daniel is she's like 
00:17:40	00:17:44	2	well she does he does more with the with david now than <unk> than than he 
00:17:44	00:17:46	1	but he does with daniel now i'm like that's because 
00:17:46	00:17:50	2	older and he's like not around as much 'cause he's out with his friends right i'm like 
00:17:50	00:17:54	1	he took daniel to disney world and i'm like yes he did 
00:17:54	00:17:56	2	a lot of this stuff because daniel was older 
00:17:56	00:18:04	1	but on the other hand he never did anything that compensate for the fact that he was going to the stand and doing stuff with daniel you know he never did anything to <unk> 
00:18:04	00:18:07	2	david okay you can't take 'em didn't land but it's been a whole day at the park 
00:18:07	00:18:10	1	exactly and the thing is the one nice thing about carol 
00:18:10	00:18:20	2	i think she totally recognize that like when daniel went to disneyland with eugene 'cause you had to go to a conference he couldn't take david <unk> david was too little to like sit quietly for the day 
00:18:20	00:18:22	1	the conference 
00:18:22	00:18:25	2	so <unk> david dutch wonderland which is like you know for 
00:18:25	00:18:26	1	little kids right 
00:18:26	00:18:35	2	[noise] and i'm like eugene should have done that you know even in should a comeback and taken david dutch wonderland right and like it's always been obvious 
00:18:35	00:18:36	1	david hits 
00:18:36	00:18:45	2	eugene all the time and it's always like kind of mean to them <unk> and you just kind of wines and goes day any day and my dad cooks 
00:18:45	00:18:54	1	you know he sounds exactly the way he did when i used to hit them we were little kids really handy because he doesn't he doesn't say anything so famous and it's like it's 
00:18:54	00:19:01	2	other [noise] so poor david i feel so bad for him he's such a nice cat he's really bright 
00:19:01	00:19:05	1	and he's just like i think the reason that like 
00:19:05	00:19:06	2	see i try to tell stuff to genie 
00:19:06	00:19:08	1	cause i'm hoping that she might
