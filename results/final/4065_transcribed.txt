00:00:06	00:00:13	2	well you know it came across on i'm on a um computer mailing lists um on my email from 
00:00:13	00:00:18	1	um it's a research thing for a psycho linguistics and u. penn 
00:00:18	00:00:28	2	um they're building a linguistic data base of many languages and so um they were offering three phone calls anywhere in the world we have to only speak 
00:00:28	00:00:34	1	one language though so they're collecting lots of different languages but you have to only speak 
00:00:34	00:00:35	2	then the two 
00:00:35	00:00:38	1	have to speak the same language so i could only 
00:00:38	00:00:43	2	english speaker so that was the <unk> you should 
00:00:43	00:00:44	1	throwing in lots of german 
00:00:44	00:00:53	2	[laughter] i should be or should not be [laughter] um yeah i know that would be hard but i decided to go for us yeah um 
00:00:53	00:00:56	1	i'm all in french and german and all the 
00:00:56	00:00:59	2	well that'd be really good i mean they're really going to record this really gonna use it for something or 
00:00:59	00:01:04	1	yeah i guess so um i'm my guess is that either 
00:01:04	00:01:09	2	for doing some sort of speech recognition systems uh for computers or 
00:01:14	00:01:23	1	<unk> they look at the properties of languages what the <unk> are various kinds of words occurring together and such um and all that <unk> 
00:01:23	00:01:26	2	yeah yeah so i know what it's for 
00:01:32	00:01:36	2	yeah a couple of weeks ago and i don't know what she's coming along [laughter]

00:02:19	00:02:26	1	you know saying things in being kind of funny and uh walking around and uh just being nice nice little 
00:02:26	00:02:30	2	oh that's neat 
00:02:30	00:02:32	1	what and she's happy 
00:02:46	00:02:52	1	just beginning to get more fussy because she can walk now and um 
00:02:52	00:02:59	2	well she's what how old a ten month but she see that that's very early for walking yes hands 
00:03:10	00:03:11	1	oh that's nice

00:03:20	00:03:21	1	we can't distracts 
00:03:21	00:03:24	2	easily anymore so she's had to do 
00:03:46	00:03:52	1	life is tough yeah i know getting er we're breaking her spirit earlier 
00:03:52	00:03:56	2	or a girl my goodness [laughter] uh-huh 
00:03:56	00:03:59	1	see the number of words now um 
00:03:59	00:04:11	2	no it surprises me like the other day i said do you want to go upstairs and change it and get a clean diapers or something like that and she stopped what she was doing and went over to the stairs and i don't know what piece of that she understood 
00:04:11	00:04:17	1	diaper stairs or what but some things are getting through and she um 
00:04:17	00:04:28	2	has said her first word which was kitty kitty cat um which is our cat you know i don't know that he knows that it's a general word it's sort of a proper now 
00:04:28	00:04:30	1	[noise] uh and she's 
00:04:46	00:04:47	1	well this is my fourth 
00:04:47	00:04:48	2	so yeah end of august 
00:04:48	00:04:50	1	oh yeah 
00:04:53	00:04:55	1	oh that's nice yeah she's 
00:04:55	00:05:04	2	had strong um her daycare people say whenever there's a conflict between the two kids and two kids a daycare that's always wins 
00:05:04	00:05:10	1	and even though she's much smaller than these other kids she's just very focused and very determined 
00:05:10	00:05:12	2	nah she doesn't cry 
00:05:12	00:05:16	1	she doesn't look at another kid she just goes for the toy that they're holding 
00:05:16	00:05:32	2	until she gets it and then the not nice part of this that i'm sure will get better river age i hope is she'll play with the toy as long as the other kids interested and when they're no longer interested she throws it away [laughter] so there's a little militia side 
00:05:32	00:05:33	1	yeah 
00:05:33	00:05:35	2	um well i don't know i 
00:05:35	00:05:36	1	yeah [laughter] 
00:05:36	00:05:41	2	to uh we can get to uh 
00:05:57	00:05:59	2	easily you can train as shy kid 
00:05:59	00:06:01	1	to stand up for herself 
00:06:01	00:06:04	2	right so i think she'll be okay

00:06:31	00:06:37	1	who were majoring in communicative disorders so there's students who are going to go on and practice 
00:06:38	00:06:41	1	they're not very theoretically oriented they're applied oriented 
00:06:41	00:06:45	2	and um they're not as good as my students at san diego 
00:07:00	00:07:08	1	they knew they had to go to graduate school so they really did work very hard they knew they had to get him being a mid term almost all of them had season 
00:07:08	00:07:12	2	these um and so they pulled it up they work very very

00:08:01	00:08:04	1	and then they and they didn't do that and they're doing stupid 
00:08:04	00:08:10	2	things like um they want to start a football team which is a considerable financial and

00:08:23	00:08:24	1	school with a population 
00:08:24	00:08:36	2	of seven hundred that's not the best way to spend your money you know they're never going to be good football team so yeah it's not <unk> that is that is amazing

00:15:33	00:15:37	2	a lot of good things in rhode island and um you know 
00:15:37	00:15:38	1	their life 
00:15:38	00:15:52	2	a lot less complicated and she has more to be a parent and it's just not going to have the same kind of career that she had thought about run as working as a financial consultant for um merrill lynch and 
00:15:52	00:15:58	1	yeah he had been doing work for some environmental from as a consultant 
00:15:58	00:15:59	2	oh and

00:16:09	00:16:26	2	new area that fast each time um and he said he went and had some tests and he was diagnosed as having attention deficit disorder which you know given how he how far he's gotten you know it goes degree at tufts and all i found that surprising that for the first time isn't it 
00:16:26	00:16:31	1	they're diagnosing us um i wonder about it but 
00:16:31	00:16:35	2	yeah but that's what he said and um he 
00:16:42	00:16:43	1	and there were so

00:17:06	00:17:09	1	she said they had or doing things that she really wasn't qualified to do 
00:17:09	00:17:22	2	and then she really didn't feel confident doing and they've mutually agree that she should leave and so she was looking for another job and um i'm sure she'll find one she's so talented 
00:17:22	00:17:24	1	yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
00:17:24	00:17:33	2	yeah and so we met um [noise] uh adrian their kid who was lonely and just really lovely little boy

00:22:26	00:22:28	2	mhm mhm but 
00:22:36	00:22:40	2	yeah it'll be english focus more on line 
00:22:40	00:22:44	1	which is far away and uh who knows huh 
00:22:44	00:22:56	2	so that's uh you know some concern about these things have been but last year england was way way down and this year they're up again france flux of either all fluctuating a lot and um there's some concern 
00:22:56	00:22:57	1	mhm

00:23:29	00:23:39	1	anyone i'd ever interviewed in california i say that gave me made me think okay best can go to school here i was being very condescending about her going to school in the mid west before that 
00:23:39	00:23:43	2	that they were just oh no no no it's a self selecting process 
00:23:43	00:23:50	1	and the people who apply to places like tough when they apply to a whole bunch of other good places and the problem is that they go you know some people go to the hospital 
00:23:50	00:23:53	2	<unk> yeah i think it's sort of <unk> 
00:23:53	00:23:55	1	so i think for the very best 
00:23:55	00:24:02	2	four i did her first choice was not tough i think it was somewhere like carleton um

00:24:30	00:24:35	1	do this and his name because we could each do at one so you may get another call from us and they're not just in future 
00:24:35	00:24:40	2	[noise] <unk> you have to wait for them to register him [laughter] okay okay <unk>

00:25:33	00:25:34	1	mhm

00:25:36	00:25:38	1	it's interesting 
00:25:38	00:25:54	2	first year you sort of you're happy you have a job stuff goes well then the second year you figure out what's wrong and you figure it's not that hard to fix it and i suspect in another year or so i'll be used to the fact that you can't fix [laughter] 
00:25:54	00:25:59	1	but yeah yeah it's still committee work takes takes enormous amount of time and 
00:25:59	00:26:00	2	mhm 
00:26:00	00:26:02	1	probably wonder sometimes 
00:26:02	00:26:05	2	whether it's all worth uh well it it it 
00:26:05	00:26:15	1	especially when you know you didn't committees where you you're supposed to be doing something but then ah masturbation goes and does something entirely and say you've wasted your time entirely 
00:26:15	00:26:16	2	oh my god 
00:26:16	00:26:24	1	so it's it's a little frustrating but uh it's it's it's it's not any worse here than anywhere else it's just

00:29:30	00:29:33	1	i don't know exactly different kinds of problems 
00:29:33	00:29:54	2	yeah and um maybe you know having more of the big picture and stuff where people who were teaching or running a program or everybody gets [laughter] uh tied down instead of a small little corner and thinks that corner is kind of the beginning of the end world without end yeah and it's very interesting i i 
00:29:54	00:29:56	1	uh uh 
00:29:58	00:29:59	1	doing what i'm doing
