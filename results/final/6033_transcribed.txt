00:00:10	00:00:15	1	hey let me just read this it's coming out of the university of pennsylvania 
00:00:15	00:00:18	2	and his uh-huh collecting telephone 
00:00:18	00:00:25	1	<unk> in american english someone who's across or someone who's in a foreign country but american born 
00:00:25	00:00:29	2	so huh you qualify for that [laughter] 
00:00:29	00:00:30	1	wow 
00:00:30	00:00:41	2	[noise] and um as part of this research um it's any place in the world uh-huh and um i'll get ten dollars 
00:00:41	00:00:50	1	i think ten but it's going to the milwaukee cheaper is here that's like a g._e._d. one of our sisters works 
00:00:50	00:00:54	2	so some of that money will you know go there 
00:00:54	00:00:56	1	oh and um 
00:00:56	00:01:04	2	couldn't talk to anyone for thirty minutes uh let's see what else the identities of the participants will be 
00:01:04	00:01:07	1	confidential <unk> will be 
00:01:07	00:01:18	2	with the recorded <unk> ah data you the <unk> will be asked to obtain consent them to call party before recording begins and then i did 
00:01:18	00:01:20	1	mhm so it's 
00:01:20	00:01:24	2	yes this research is uh 
00:01:24	00:01:29	1	you know i don't know if it's to see that it's you know the <unk> linguistics 
00:01:29	00:01:39	2	you know the the pattern of how we talk [laughter] uh-huh so it is and what we talk about or whatever so how long you been 
00:01:39	00:01:41	1	well i've been doing pretty good 
00:01:41	00:01:44	2	yeah and you know 
00:01:44	00:01:53	1	[noise] it's like you know you go well that's a big question to answer but really you know i can tell that i'll be here a year 
00:01:57	00:02:12	2	i always say it takes me a year to get adjusted omelets to wherever you go yeah but i mean here it's like there's so much to get adjusted to uh-huh but i think i can say that you know i i think i'm feeling better about everything 
00:02:12	00:02:13	1	okay okay 
00:02:13	00:02:17	2	and now that learning chinese is getting better but [laughter] 
00:02:17	00:02:20	1	[laughter] but that that must be extremely difficult 
00:02:20	00:02:22	2	i find it very very hot 
00:02:22	00:02:23	1	i just um 
00:02:23	00:02:28	2	[noise] oh you know you learn every lesson you 
00:02:28	00:02:35	1	last thing you do fear and then you go on there and the next one you keep learning so much you can't remember i can't remember what i learned 
00:02:35	00:02:41	2	yeah i would get i'm like that too [laughter] 
00:02:41	00:02:44	1	and it and it really does get harder the older you get 
00:02:44	00:02:44	2	mhm 
00:02:44	00:02:47	1	right well i think i think people 
00:02:47	00:02:55	2	that you know that you don't remember as well it fifty six as you did learn you know you were in your twenties yeah 
00:02:55	00:02:57	1	one of my fellow 
00:02:57	00:03:10	2	<unk> the sister i'm living with there's five of us that live together and um one let's see she's got thirty five and she keeps saying oh age doesn't make any difference i think yes it does uh-huh because i just don't think you'd do remarry 
00:03:10	00:03:15	1	<unk> well yeah yeah well and i think too 
00:03:15	00:03:18	2	if a person has been 
00:03:18	00:03:19	1	well you know 
00:03:19	00:03:25	2	we keep her ourselves learning okay but i think in that intensity 
00:03:35	00:03:38	2	you know if you say i mean we 
00:03:45	00:03:48	2	but then uh 
00:03:48	00:03:53	1	i i don't know if i could have learned that even at twenty five or thirty five you know 
00:04:10	00:04:11	1	right 
00:04:11	00:04:20	2	you know it's just 'cause i figured i'd just i don't think i'm gonna have to write that much in my day to day work at the hospital 
00:04:20	00:04:21	1	uh-huh 
00:04:21	00:04:28	2	because you can chart um in the health care field apparently in english and or chinese 
00:04:28	00:04:30	1	oh so um 
00:04:30	00:04:49	2	you know for that reason and i said you know you go to school for two years they'll take a year to get oriented and i don't know what i'm gonna be doing [laughter] yeah so i i will i will not be literate i'm afraid by the time i leave you know as far as being able to write well i'll be able to write 
00:04:49	00:04:53	1	basic but um you know [noise] i just hope 
00:04:53	00:05:03	2	i find it so hard to understand what people say 'cause it's like an english you know knew people who are learning our language yes you know they say we talk so 
00:05:03	00:05:04	1	yes yeah mhm 
00:05:04	00:05:07	2	i say the same thing about the people here they talk so 
00:05:07	00:05:09	1	yes yeah 
00:05:09	00:05:13	2	that it's just it's a very hard to not do to learn it do they 
00:05:33	00:05:35	1	same thing yeah 
00:05:35	00:05:37	2	you know like i keep saying you can say 
00:05:37	00:05:38	1	<unk> yeah 
00:05:38	00:05:39	2	uh-huh 
00:05:39	00:05:42	1	yeah uh-huh uh-huh 
00:05:42	00:05:58	2	you know and everyone means something different yeah and then sometimes you have two that are the same you can save my ma but they're different characters who when you speak it you know you only know supposedly from the contacts which 
00:06:06	00:06:20	2	actors i don't know how you get it altogether [laughter] yeah [laughter] well uh but you know they see that the first year is hard i guess the second year it gets harder 
00:06:20	00:06:23	1	harder and harder yeah 
00:06:23	00:06:32	2	[laughter] and my teacher says that you know you do you learn all this like heavy larry and you learn patterns for two years 
00:06:32	00:06:32	1	then you 
00:06:32	00:06:35	2	go to where you're going you know 
00:06:35	00:06:37	1	and then you spend a year 
00:06:37	00:06:39	2	sort of 
00:06:39	00:06:41	1	almost um 
00:06:41	00:06:44	2	read learning the words that you use frequently 
00:06:44	00:06:45	1	oh you know and you 
00:06:45	00:06:50	2	you start learning those and high you know how you say and i'm sure like in healthcare 
00:06:50	00:06:51	1	hi um 
00:06:51	00:07:04	2	i'll i'll you know get familiar with certainly saying you know how are you feeling today where is your pain you know are you sick to your stomach er how long has it been you know how long have you had you know there's this routine 
00:07:04	00:07:06	1	things sure 
00:07:06	00:07:10	2	that in that environment you will you know concentrate on 
00:07:10	00:07:11	1	yeah so 
00:07:11	00:07:15	2	after i finish the book i 'cause i have you have to 
00:07:15	00:07:16	1	two major 
00:07:16	00:07:20	2	that you learn basic cable or you learn over a thousand carrots 
00:07:20	00:07:22	1	oh wow and i'm going 
00:07:22	00:07:30	2	going to try and spend several months four months maybe at least maybe a little bit more learning healthcare terminology 
00:07:30	00:07:31	1	oh 
00:07:31	00:07:36	2	because then i hope you know that um that will be more practical 
00:07:36	00:07:37	1	uh-huh 
00:07:37	00:07:50	2	you know you could cause you can learn business terminology you could learn a lot of them take moral tails the different things like that but i keep thinking well you know i'm going to be working with people yeah 
00:07:50	00:07:52	1	so i need to learn how to talk to them 
00:07:52	00:07:56	2	right i know my my 
00:07:56	00:07:59	1	that is some yeah yeah figured it was like 
00:07:59	00:08:15	2	see when i was on guam the vietnamese uh came uh-huh and i uh we took in uh some sisters and so each day yeah each evening after supper i would go over and try to teach them english 
00:08:15	00:08:18	1	you know and uh 
00:08:18	00:08:35	2	so i could feel the frustration of trying to learn i ask them to teach me you know um you know just a word or <unk> or you know things like that and then i got a book you know but nothing on a regular basis for myself it was just you know like 
00:08:35	00:08:37	1	just to give 
00:08:37	00:08:41	2	back to me that frustration that they were feeling and trying to learn 
00:08:41	00:08:47	1	you know the language and it was so complicated and they had five and twenty 
00:08:47	00:08:50	2	mhm yeah 
00:08:50	00:08:52	1	and i could not hear the difference 
00:08:52	00:08:57	2	you know because i remember one thing i remember like 
00:08:57	00:08:59	1	um was <unk> and 
00:08:59	00:09:03	2	and string was <unk> or something [laughter] 
00:09:03	00:09:06	1	a different different ways you know uptown over or what 
00:09:06	00:09:13	2	and it's like i could not i could not hear it and they would keep scene and i would listen and i could not get that 
00:09:13	00:09:14	1	mhm 
00:09:14	00:09:19	2	so but look at isn't that amazing how we learn as we grew up 
00:09:19	00:09:22	1	oh as a baby uh-huh uh-huh 
00:09:22	00:09:25	2	it really is a miracle when you think about cats 
00:09:25	00:09:27	1	it is because 
00:09:45	00:09:49	1	um i've i've done some volunteering with 
00:09:49	00:09:54	2	seeing the local um chinese people to work with their english 
00:09:54	00:09:56	1	oh and you know yeah 
00:09:56	00:09:58	2	laugh at them 
00:09:58	00:09:59	1	they make 
00:09:59	00:10:06	2	and then you think oh my god you know i'm making mistakes so much worse because here the 
00:10:06	00:10:12	1	kids start studying english in there uh freshman year in high school some of 'em in junior high 
00:10:12	00:10:16	2	[noise] so by the time they get to college you know they have at least 
00:10:16	00:10:17	1	forty six years of 
00:10:19	00:10:20	1	wow 
00:10:20	00:10:36	2	okay now where they don't get to do is to talk a lot um so i mean it's like me i i find it so hard to speak because i have to think oh let's see i want to say like i was just thinking i could say to you you know i could say what we're doing is very interesting 
00:10:36	00:10:39	1	uh-huh you know and i have to think now let's see 
00:10:39	00:10:51	2	wow what and then we and then doing you think of the vocabulary words then it's the grammar order because so much of a grammar is the opposite of what we have in england 
00:10:51	00:10:54	1	wow isn't that you know they 
00:10:54	00:11:05	2	'cause if i say you know i like you i can say what i need now that's the same order or they see me why you i like 
00:11:05	00:11:10	1	you know there's so many things um you know if you say the children 
00:11:10	00:11:13	2	and our um buying candy 
00:11:13	00:11:13	1	you know you go 
00:11:13	00:11:20	2	<unk> my town orangutans heights them in my 
00:11:20	00:11:26	1	or you know there's there's so many different ways of saying it and you go now which way do i use now 
00:11:26	00:11:32	2	[laughter] oh oh oh yeah 
00:11:32	00:11:40	1	and uh now are you living with uh chinese sisters or are they from all different cultures 
00:11:40	00:11:44	2	no you know when i first came here i lived um 
00:11:44	00:11:49	1	[noise] really in a residence for girls and there was one 
00:11:49	00:12:00	2	of a floor they had six sisters on and there were two of us to americans one was from the philippines one was two are from korea 
00:12:00	00:12:02	1	and one was from here in taiwan 
00:12:02	00:12:09	2	[noise] so there were six of us know each we did our own cooking and you know so 
00:12:09	00:12:13	1	didn't have a lot in common oh yeah um 
00:12:13	00:12:29	2	we just found that environment so hard because with no cooking facilities and no you <unk> you know no place wash dishes and the noise level was awful so we have moved and as of october first with the sisters or providence from terre haute indiana 
00:12:29	00:12:31	1	oh okay they <unk> they have 
00:12:50	00:12:52	2	so at this point um
