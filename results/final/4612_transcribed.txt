00:05:07	00:05:12	1	yeah it's a strange it's there's something something else must be going on that uh 
00:05:12	00:05:13	1	that's causing this 
00:05:15	00:05:16	1	yeah 
00:05:16	00:05:18	2	so what do you think's gonna happen i don't know 
00:05:18	00:05:20	1	well what's gonna happen 
00:05:20	00:05:22	2	yeah 
00:05:26	00:05:29	1	it's gonna take it right now they want to 
00:05:29	00:05:30	1	uh have 
00:05:30	00:05:31	2	right 
00:05:32	00:05:37	2	you talk to them they're going on right now are talks where they are 
00:05:42	00:05:47	2	but what they want to do and this is even something that that that's happening and uh people in the right 
00:05:51	00:05:57	2	immediately go into the the the um the final satisfied 
00:05:57	00:05:58	1	yeah that's probably a good idea in 
00:05:59	00:06:03	2	right and with the whole the whole being that was 
00:06:03	00:06:05	1	they start talking about jerusalem 
00:06:06	00:06:12	1	and start talking about a few other uh hot issues that this whole thing will blow up 
00:06:12	00:06:14	2	oh <unk> well yeah like water 
00:06:14	00:06:16	1	well what do they read 
00:06:16	00:06:17	2	already oh they did 
00:06:17	00:06:18	1	you agreed on with what 
00:06:18	00:06:19	2	mhm 
00:06:19	00:06:26	2	and to see how crazy it is the israelis and said the two things one that with the 
00:06:33	00:06:34	1	significant 
00:06:34	00:06:35	2	problems 
00:06:35	00:06:36	1	until the 
00:06:36	00:06:38	2	two thousand twenty 
00:06:38	00:06:41	1	yeah they said essentially that it's pretty up there pushing it or 
00:06:41	00:06:44	2	twenty five years and they said they're going to old estimates 
00:06:44	00:06:48	1	twenty five years we're going to have a major major 
00:06:48	00:06:56	2	problems in israel mhm because when we just won't have any more right now the the palestinians their part 
00:06:56	00:06:57	2	would be 
00:07:12	00:07:14	1	if it would be able to if they 
00:07:14	00:07:15	2	to drill for water 
00:07:15	00:07:19	1	they <unk> they'd be able to do so and we really wouldn't have any uh 
00:07:21	00:07:32	2	wouldn't have an opportunity to to tonight to deny them that right now if they go into the aquifers they will be able to do two things one 
00:07:32	00:07:34	2	rain all the aquifers mhm 
00:07:34	00:07:35	1	yeah 
00:07:35	00:07:37	1	oh boy

00:07:54	00:07:56	1	or they can polluted 
00:07:56	00:07:59	1	where they don't get it we don't get it but

00:08:05	00:08:08	2	they they said is <unk> where we live in 
00:08:08	00:08:13	1	did you date some area is one third of the areas water supply the gold one 
00:08:13	00:08:15	1	that's another third 
00:08:15	00:08:16	1	and israel 
00:08:17	00:08:19	1	but the funny thing is that 
00:08:19	00:08:20	2	the palestinians 
00:08:20	00:08:22	1	i'm sure this this is this 
00:08:28	00:08:30	2	oh they did 
00:08:30	00:08:33	1	can you believe in <unk> they they laid parts 
00:08:33	00:08:40	2	yeah hi parts of the others but i don't understand is is that before nineteen forty eight before the partition plan 
00:08:41	00:08:42	1	it was just one big area 
00:08:47	00:08:49	2	dining trans jordan 
00:08:49	00:08:52	2	right and they refused right but now you're gonna have three 
00:08:52	00:08:54	1	countries instead of two i don't understand that 
00:08:55	00:08:56	1	you know 
00:09:04	00:09:07	2	right they said well one of the rebellion here said that 
00:09:16	00:09:18	2	so you terms of

00:09:27	00:09:29	2	uh-huh 
00:09:29	00:09:31	2	getting back to what we're talking about 
00:09:31	00:09:33	1	they're going to um 
00:09:33	00:09:34	1	uh huh 
00:09:34	00:09:36	2	immediately afterwards

00:10:02	00:10:05	2	uh i think we're we're going to it 
00:10:08	00:10:10	2	i think that's going to be uh 
00:10:10	00:10:11	1	pretty much 
00:10:11	00:10:18	2	i can only problem is is cal kill ya yeah <unk> is is is uh 
00:10:18	00:10:20	1	literally a hundred yards away 
00:10:20	00:10:25	2	from <unk> right and people in <unk> are going 
00:10:25	00:10:26	1	we're not uh 
00:10:26	00:10:29	2	uh going crazy they're going crazy to have 
00:10:29	00:10:30	1	no idea 
00:10:30	00:10:31	1	well <unk> 
00:10:32	00:10:39	2	have no idea how bad is going to be the one on one side and the other side that they're just they're literally 
00:10:40	00:10:42	1	um uh you voting 
00:10:42	00:10:44	2	any possibilities thinking about this 
00:10:45	00:10:46	2	we have politicians advice 
00:10:46	00:10:47	1	everything else 
00:10:48	00:10:50	1	marsha 
00:10:52	00:10:53	1	it has it been 
00:10:53	00:10:54	2	she'll be 
00:10:54	00:10:55	1	being horrendous 
00:10:55	00:10:59	2	even today yeah they did they <unk> they 
00:11:03	00:11:06	2	because they found um 
00:11:06	00:11:06	1	mhm 
00:11:06	00:11:10	2	uh they said they haven't come to the looking 
00:11:10	00:11:11	1	looking for a person 
00:11:11	00:11:13	2	plan to have uh and uh 
00:11:13	00:11:14	1	you know 
00:11:16	00:11:18	2	and while looking 
00:11:18	00:11:21	1	defend that israel is really found that out 
00:11:21	00:11:21	2	uh-huh 
00:11:21	00:11:27	1	and they they notify the um the uh palestinian the police 
00:11:28	00:11:29	2	i find those guys 
00:11:29	00:11:30	1	well 
00:11:30	00:11:34	2	you'd find in trying to find this guy 
00:11:34	00:11:38	2	they came across another group who plan to have a suicide bomb 
00:11:38	00:11:39	1	right 
00:11:40	00:11:42	1	so this is it it's just 
00:11:42	00:11:51	2	yeah that's what i think it was yeah i think that's amazing that they keep blowing up things in tel aviv and like these <unk> being in paris don't get it 
00:11:52	00:11:53	1	mhm 
00:11:53	00:12:00	1	no the thing that happens is that when these things happen they go off we have we have to give you have to give the land back quicker 
00:12:00	00:12:08	2	yeah but it seems to help them but they have no rights for this the whole time that you're from europe and and they were in charge there was nothing going on 
00:12:13	00:12:18	2	so when you you know it's totally mind boggling what's going 
00:12:19	00:12:23	2	<unk> i think they're they're feeling is 
00:12:23	00:12:25	1	yeah yeah 
00:12:25	00:12:28	2	that we are willing to live with 
00:12:28	00:12:29	1	action 
00:12:30	00:12:34	1	because if you take the you said physically 
00:12:38	00:12:41	2	you know people who were killed by by wars 
00:12:53	00:12:55	1	<unk> people to kill yes 
00:12:55	00:12:57	2	a hundred or a ten thousand 
00:13:03	00:13:05	2	we're supposed to do that 
00:13:05	00:13:07	1	daily life is not 
00:13:07	00:13:08	2	supposed to do that 
00:13:08	00:13:11	1	you know these guys are more on if they think that works 
00:13:14	00:13:15	1	oh he's gonna disappear 
00:13:15	00:13:17	2	when you get land back as the country 
00:13:17	00:13:18	1	they weren't <unk> 
00:13:18	00:13:20	2	no one's gonna care 
00:13:22	00:13:24	1	that's gonna be it 
00:13:33	00:13:36	2	and um hopefully ah 
00:13:36	00:13:37	1	uh-huh 
00:13:37	00:13:45	2	we'll be able to hold off until the next election but even still the next elections <unk> not going to be ah 
00:13:45	00:13:45	1	mhm 
00:13:45	00:13:49	2	the food is not going to stop the process 
00:13:49	00:13:49	1	no they're not 
00:13:50	00:13:52	2	no i'm not going to stop it 
00:13:52	00:13:53	1	yeah 
00:13:53	00:13:55	1	it's crazy it's well 
00:13:55	00:13:57	2	so you recommend against <unk> at this point 
00:14:07	00:14:08	1	mhm
