00:01:26	00:01:30	2	oh i can see wow well do you think they're going to

00:01:47	00:01:49	1	you know lie yeah 
00:01:49	00:01:52	2	i think we we're gonna have to

00:02:07	00:02:10	1	see we our numbers are down to you know 
00:02:10	00:02:17	2	we have uh uh the total enrollment as down and so i think uh probably will 
00:02:17	00:02:19	1	that affects that too 
00:02:19	00:02:20	2	mhm 
00:02:20	00:02:21	1	a lot of 
00:02:23	00:02:28	2	[noise] what um yeah i'm trying to i've sent faxes and

00:03:00	00:03:05	1	wondering maybe i should should i just pick a date and 
00:03:07	00:03:17	2	think you know at first we were talking about that tried to work it in with the festival but i don't it's gonna be good because of the fact that we 
00:03:17	00:03:20	1	foreign teachers minneapolis

00:03:28	00:03:32	2	the third and then be down for the fourth and fifth 
00:03:32	00:03:34	1	mhm so

00:12:09	00:12:10	2	yeah 
00:12:10	00:12:12	1	he's just been a little bit 
00:12:23	00:12:30	1	yeah and uh you know she was trying to memorize the whole book and we're saying no you've got to you 
00:12:49	00:12:56	2	and he's you know minimal mhm he's doing the minimal but there is another japanese girl 
00:12:56	00:13:01	1	in his class who didn't come through j._c. j._c. she's a high school 
00:13:01	00:13:10	2	mhm and is very on motivated very poor attitude attitude and it's just 
00:13:25	00:13:27	1	she's failing 
00:13:27	00:13:34	2	she should be by her testing she should be taught the student in the class she could be easily 
00:13:34	00:13:35	1	but she's just 
00:13:39	00:13:43	2	not interested in mhm we've had some 
00:13:43	00:13:46	1	knock down drag helps with her 
00:13:46	00:13:53	2	she's just really immature the other japanese girl say oh she's just you know it's immaturity 
00:13:53	00:13:53	1	mhm 
00:13:53	00:13:57	2	[noise] but uh [noise] because he 
00:13:57	00:14:01	2	just identify with her 
00:14:01	00:14:01	1	mhm 
00:14:01	00:14:07	2	you know he is not performing too where he could perform or should pre form 
00:14:07	00:14:07	1	mhm 
00:14:11	00:14:12	1	mhm 
00:14:12	00:14:14	2	you know not 
00:14:14	00:14:16	1	great but better [laughter] 
00:14:16	00:14:21	2	[noise] so he and it's real interesting you know i don't know 
00:14:21	00:14:27	1	at what point i will call up his cousin you know his aunt and uncle that 
00:14:27	00:14:29	2	here yeah i know in town 
00:14:30	00:14:32	2	and uh this 
00:14:32	00:14:33	1	got to be 
00:14:33	00:14:43	2	bit of a problem because his cousin he said yeah she just passed the bar exam and set up her own <unk> 
00:14:48	00:14:49	1	you know and she 
00:14:49	00:14:50	2	i mean you see 
00:14:50	00:14:53	2	very very american 
00:14:53	00:14:54	1	mhm totally 
00:14:54	00:14:56	2	american 
00:14:56	00:15:00	2	and i'm certain she can read him 
00:15:06	00:15:08	2	this is a little bit of a problem 
00:15:08	00:15:09	1	you know he's just 
00:15:10	00:15:12	2	mhm not getting with the program 
00:15:19	00:15:21	1	yeah 
00:15:21	00:15:24	2	today we had to doubt um they had their mid terms last 
00:15:24	00:15:25	1	mhm 
00:15:25	00:15:31	2	and the teacher's got their grades and comment c._n._n. for the first time because we're having this [noise] 
00:15:31	00:15:32	1	motivational 
00:15:33	00:15:34	1	mhm 
00:15:34	00:15:37	2	we handed out mid term grades to everyone 
00:15:37	00:15:38	1	mhm 
00:15:38	00:15:42	2	so that they would see what they've got to do and the next three weeks to 
00:15:42	00:15:44	1	mhm mhm 
00:15:44	00:15:48	2	and uh so we'll see next week what happens 
00:15:48	00:15:49	1	mhm 
00:15:49	00:15:53	2	yeah we have an interesting situation we've got fifty 
00:15:53	00:15:55	1	too 
00:15:55	00:15:56	1	um 
00:15:56	00:16:06	2	you know very similar to what j. c. j. c. does except the only thing we're responsible for is the english we're doing fifty hours 
00:16:08	00:16:09	1	english 
00:16:18	00:16:22	1	mm they're here right now mhm and um 
00:16:23	00:16:27	2	i've got you know teachers but there is there's 
00:16:27	00:16:28	1	less of a 
00:16:37	00:16:39	2	so it's a lot easier 
00:16:39	00:16:44	1	than the j. c. j. c. cultural curious [laughter] 
00:16:54	00:16:55	1	one group 
00:16:55	00:17:01	2	and nine for the other 'cause we had the fourth of july in there so there was no school 
00:17:12	00:17:15	1	all of them are very experience so they can 
00:17:18	00:17:24	2	mhm um and then we did a a quick diagnostic the first day 
00:17:24	00:17:27	2	and we divided them into 
00:17:27	00:17:28	1	groups 
00:17:28	00:17:32	2	and um they're taking off from there but it's working out quite 
00:17:32	00:17:33	1	mhm 
00:17:33	00:17:34	1	so um 
00:17:34	00:17:36	2	you know that was uh 
00:17:37	00:17:40	2	so that's going on now besides the regular classes 
00:17:40	00:17:41	1	mhm 
00:17:41	00:17:45	2	but we of course keep meat in separate places but 
00:17:45	00:17:51	2	are chinese student we have just one taiwan student right now 
00:17:51	00:17:52	1	and so she 
00:17:52	00:17:55	2	she's it's it's food for the heart to go and 
00:17:55	00:18:00	1	eat with them and talk chinese and kind of hang out 
00:18:00	00:18:01	2	yeah
