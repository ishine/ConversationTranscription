00:02:47	00:02:51	2	<unk> well now do we ever find that job 
00:02:51	00:03:00	1	that's that's basically what i mean i haven't found i liked his job and i would love to do this part time and you know goof around and stuff but i still get paid hourly basis 
00:03:00	00:03:11	2	yeah i i'm getting paid ten dollars an hour which is okay we're yeah we're not going to say that when i'm being paid really an everyday it's less what the face so 
00:03:11	00:03:15	1	and like this week you know i might i'll probably work like around 
00:03:15	00:03:18	2	oh probably over twenty hours this week 
00:03:18	00:03:23	1	but then uh first i guess she had already hired another lady 
00:03:23	00:03:42	2	or talk to know someone else to start teaching this guy mhm and he wants to five hours a day so what she did what she said well i'll give you know each of you half so i'm only teaching him it's monday to saturday but i'm only teaching him like fourteen and a half hours a week and then but like she she asked me today

00:04:26	00:04:29	2	feeling for me for a class tomorrow for an hour and a half and 
00:04:29	00:04:32	1	so i i think she's probably going to be like that 
00:04:32	00:04:38	2	she's she's trying to get her masters because she's not sure they're going to be able to hang onto this language school because 
00:04:38	00:04:42	1	with the evaluation of the past and they lost a lot of their clients 
00:04:42	00:04:51	2	oh okay and um so yeah we just had another one yeah uh-huh uh-huh and in december gas is going up <unk>

00:15:30	00:15:38	2	[noise] of course this had happened okay so that was like major trauma and we were having need your problems because of this major trial 
00:15:38	00:15:41	1	[noise] which i'll write to you later 
00:15:41	00:15:43	2	and so um

00:16:02	00:16:04	1	overnight for a night or two each time 
00:16:19	00:16:22	1	so yeah 
00:16:22	00:16:31	2	<unk> even the horse was there for like six weeks uh you know costing us you know more than much more than me 
00:16:31	00:16:32	1	the horse's worth [laughter] we had to 
00:16:32	00:16:36	2	i wouldn't want to yeah much definitely much more than it's worth to me 
00:16:36	00:16:38	1	[laughter] 
00:16:38	00:16:50	2	and but finally it did get cured and so the second time they they approved it to come across the border and the only sort of good thing that's happened in relation to her so far is that 
00:16:50	00:16:52	1	and looking at stable 
00:16:52	00:16:58	2	stuff around here it turned out somebody said there's a stable is real close to your house but they're very expensive so 
00:16:58	00:16:59	1	go there i said well let's just go 
00:16:59	00:17:03	2	cat and see if maybe we can strike some kind of deal with them or whatever 
00:17:03	00:17:05	1	turns out 
00:17:05	00:17:18	2	these people are uh their daughter was kicked in the head last last year by a horse and was in a coma and so they're like a major bills and stuff too but they they're building a new stable and want to build a new house and stuff 
00:17:18	00:17:19	1	so they 
00:17:19	00:17:34	2	deal with them that that they would drop their plans for this place in exchange for the first month uh rent and board mhm right down the street from my house it's really really incredibly convenient for that though 
00:17:34	00:17:37	1	but now they're they're lisa 
00:17:37	00:17:41	2	property down and <unk> they're moving by the middle of november

00:17:48	00:17:53	1	with some channels near that and it's going to 
00:17:53	00:17:56	2	maybe hook up with and people he had met before 
00:17:56	00:17:58	1	uh no no 
00:18:00	00:18:06	1	people that he's one of these guys who's going to a meeting with tonight actually said that that he knew 
00:18:06	00:18:07	2	mhm 
00:18:07	00:18:09	1	i try to oh that that's a nose 
00:18:09	00:18:24	2	<unk> uh-huh not one of his friends but someone someone that that the nose into <unk> so it's kind of funny he's been what a small world you know um 'cause this guy apparently he used to live in <unk> new this guy too but [laughter] [laughter] so so he 
00:18:24	00:18:27	1	but i can't i can't even find a job that there's no jobs <unk> 
00:18:27	00:18:36	2	well first of all because he's got blue blood you know so <unk> unless unless you know something is big no you know 
00:18:36	00:18:38	1	you know they're they're 
00:18:38	00:18:43	2	probably be working uh because he wants the perfect nine to five job and you know 
00:18:43	00:18:45	1	i mean you can't do that 
00:18:45	00:18:52	2	first and and good pay with you know even though even though they can't speak the language well [laughter] you know he doesn't 
00:18:52	00:18:54	1	he doesn't think that should be a problem right 
00:19:08	00:19:14	2	mhm yeah what do they use what what do they use they use i mean they use computers yeah 
00:19:14	00:19:18	1	use computers everybody i mean he's been to like two places that didn't 
00:19:18	00:19:21	2	require that you know computer drafting 
00:19:21	00:19:24	1	oh what does that mean that means he has to take a course 
00:19:24	00:19:34	2	so that means you have to take a course so he's currently <unk> if he's still here next week he signed up to take this computer computer drought computer assisted drafting course next <unk> next week which 
00:19:34	00:19:36	1	next week mhm which is 
00:19:36	00:19:43	2	it's just two nights a week so i mean he can still work and you know it's not like a full time commitment or anything but 
00:19:43	00:19:46	1	nobody should do that because then you know then he can get like referral

00:26:14	00:26:18	2	some some jobs i'm really interested in here there's one that 
00:26:18	00:26:19	1	that uh 
00:26:19	00:26:25	2	used to work at seven i was kinda hoping they would hire me for just because it paid well and and had good benefits and stuff but 
00:26:25	00:26:26	1	uh-huh 
00:26:26	00:26:31	2	last week and they haven't called me so i have a suspicion they've hired somebody else because they were 
00:26:31	00:26:32	1	and my and what what 
00:26:32	00:26:39	2	it was for a ged instructor uh [noise] yeah they have a program working would drop outs is that mhm 
00:26:39	00:26:42	1	well you didn't you you've already done something [noise] 
00:26:42	00:26:52	2	i did i mean it's just like that and um but uh life more than you mccall backed in well i think i will but my former boss at that place left to go to another place 
00:26:52	00:26:54	1	and i got along real well 
00:26:54	00:27:05	2	and they know that i still get along with him and sailing in touch with him so he said oh you know what i wouldn't be surprised if they don't even don't give you the job just because they know your good friends with me and you know that you might 
00:27:05	00:27:07	1	you know pass on you know 
00:27:07	00:27:14	2	up to me or whatever so i mean that could be or or it might be that they just found somebody else too but 
00:27:14	00:27:23	1	but there's also another job just like that too which is teaching e._s._l. n. g. e. d. at a place mhm for high school dropouts who are in this ah construction 
00:27:23	00:27:30	2	uh training program and that one i just applied for it yesterday and she said there it's probably going to start in 
00:27:30	00:27:32	1	san bread that they're looking she thinks 
00:27:32	00:27:36	2	the secretary who mhm at this place that i think it's going to start or 
00:27:36	00:27:37	1	in december 
00:27:37	00:27:49	2	so that might work out really well because this job ends in december and so you know if if i knew i had something else coming up then i could hang onto this temporary thing and not feel too insecure 
00:27:49	00:27:55	1	[laughter] well yeah what <unk> but you still have a little bit of your your your 
00:27:55	00:28:10	2	from the sale and stuff but i know oh you're kidding you went through that we went through with that horse well the horse thing and and then that that was doing his back and forth and you know i mean we didn't hardly even look for work for like ten days ago that that was being so ridiculous though the whole 
00:28:10	00:28:11	1	thing and 
00:28:11	00:28:14	2	and then you know getting moved in and stuff and 
00:28:14	00:28:16	1	oh it was it was crazy 
00:28:16	00:28:32	2	alright and tell you about it but [noise] so but anyway um what was the and say oh and then also the economy here has changed so much i mean all you wouldn't believe how many companies now have just temporary have so many temporary and part time employee 
00:28:34	00:28:38	1	mhm just like the university the same thing they just yeah i 
00:28:38	00:28:40	2	i only basis yes 
00:28:40	00:28:41	1	that's what that's what 
00:28:41	00:28:58	2	almost every company is going to and i went to a business talk last night on how to start up your own business and stuff and she was telling me to she said you know that's one reason why so many people are and and now that there are many many more small businesses are like really on the rise in the states 
00:28:58	00:29:00	1	but again most of them 
00:29:00	00:29:14	2	don't have benefits for employees they've got three four five ten employees but they're they're part time you know don't give them benefits or they you know have very few benefits it's really the economy has really changed 
00:29:14	00:29:16	1	since we lived here before 
00:29:16	00:29:21	2	i mean you need to get something in in the in teaching yeah well <unk> yeah 
00:29:21	00:29:37	1	and that well that's the thing too i mean i came after the school year started because like some schools there's one lady that one catholic school private catholic school that such there's someone going on maternity leave in some time in november so she said she would hire me if i wanted but um 
00:29:46	00:29:50	1	this and she has each class at least three times a week 
00:29:50	00:29:55	2	good lord and mushy and earning something well comparable
