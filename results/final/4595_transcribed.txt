00:06:27	00:06:30	2	no i've been looking erode 
00:06:30	00:06:32	1	oh really 
00:06:32	00:06:39	2	excuse me [laughter] i've gotten into this bad habit of remember when i was an undergrad and i used to watch star trek rerun really 
00:06:39	00:06:41	1	yeah i've watched 
00:06:41	00:06:49	2	star trek reruns at midnight because there's great guy that that that i've gotten to be friends with a couple of people that have gotten to be friends with actually they watch star trek at midnight 
00:06:49	00:06:52	1	not the next generation though 
00:06:52	00:06:57	2	uh that are attracted to it is well it's the one with the captain of the card mm 
00:06:57	00:06:58	1	i don't know which one that 
00:06:58	00:07:05	2	<unk> yeah it's the earlier ones i like the new one next generation and uh-huh [laughter] into it 
00:07:05	00:07:10	1	yeah so anyway so that's why i'm yawning um but um 
00:07:10	00:07:13	2	anyway uh what was going to say um 
00:07:13	00:07:13	1	mhm 
00:07:13	00:07:16	2	so it took me a while the settling 
00:07:16	00:07:26	1	'cause and and i'm still not totally settled in i've started to do some work [noise] i did the first month that i was here i took a class in digital music 
00:07:26	00:07:30	2	oh cool electronic you know like music editing and stuff like 
00:07:30	00:07:32	1	oh that's great 'cause i've been 
00:07:39	00:07:42	1	pretty good about my contribution to that like it wasn't really 
00:07:42	00:07:45	2	exactly what i would walk but i felt 
00:07:45	00:07:47	1	oh great yeah 
00:07:47	00:08:02	2	that was that was good that was something that you know like you being here gave me access to i'm also learning a lot about computers like um like about other things about computers like about um you know how to do email and how to do 
00:08:02	00:08:03	1	like emails <unk> interesting 
00:08:03	00:08:20	2	working yeah yeah i mean you get if you get a laptop and you should also try to get a modem and hook it up to a phone because then you can have well i mean like i have a laptop i have a [noise] an email address i don't know who else that you know has an email address but it's a kind of thing that i would like 
00:08:20	00:08:21	1	contact with people is 
00:08:36	00:08:40	1	yeah it's but it's better it's even cheaper than the facts i think because it's 
00:08:40	00:08:43	2	so then it goes into the computer it's not like with paper 
00:08:43	00:08:49	1	right now with paper but as it is cheaper because it's it's the cost of a local phone call where is correct and it takes the amount of time 
00:08:49	00:08:52	2	no that really agree how you can get access to all any 
00:08:52	00:08:57	1	any information you really need i mean if you needed something about <unk> 
00:08:57	00:09:07	2	or whatever right right yeah yeah so yeah like the internet and all that kind of stuff so that's that's like i'm learning about that so that's kind of cool and um 
00:09:07	00:09:16	1	and then uh [noise] and i'm supposed to start teaching in september i'm a little bit nervous about that because i have to still put together um like a course syllabus 
00:09:16	00:09:27	2	[laughter] john [laughter] three weeks away [noise] i know [laughter] i know i know you can talk about email and stuff like that 
00:09:27	00:09:30	1	joking with you for that that's okay um 
00:09:30	00:09:40	2	just joking but okay hold on one second you know what i had to go to the bathroom hold alright i going to be having the song huh see what i can't really falling into the bathroom now he doesn't stretch hold on

00:11:59	00:12:01	1	but i mean it's good 
00:12:01	00:12:16	2	weird like i've been having you know the thing about you're saying about you know like giving up the apartment in new york and those kinds of things i mean i've been thinking about those kinds of things again also because you know i think to myself like you know i can make life easier for myself i just come to 
00:12:16	00:12:18	1	lyn i could probably like 
00:12:18	00:12:23	2	you know make of <unk> you know you know get the paperwork and order and maybe very 
00:12:23	00:12:24	1	oh really yeah 
00:12:24	00:12:40	2	go away for myself in berlin and or i could you know or you know god knows i mean this this thing here like theoretically um you can stay uh another year like you can um i could apply for an extension for another 
00:12:40	00:12:41	1	oh really 
00:12:41	00:12:44	2	yeah but and then i but then i think like you know 
00:12:44	00:12:48	1	do i want to do that and and do i want to like leave 
00:12:48	00:12:50	2	you know i you know i don't know it just feels 
00:12:50	00:12:55	1	i mean you can see i mean if you you'll know better and you're like right 
00:12:55	00:12:57	2	no i know 
00:12:57	00:13:02	1	that's a hard to <unk> i mean for me it's just like going back to new york would be great but if i can <unk> if i 
00:13:02	00:13:04	2	you know i just don't know 
00:13:04	00:13:07	1	that life again right for linens great 
00:13:07	00:13:11	2	but here it's like if i can get to a point where i can leave a little bit more 
00:13:11	00:13:12	1	often and go other 
00:13:28	00:13:34	2	a little bit too close or right right right so i think your can feel that way sometimes too though 
00:13:34	00:13:42	1	yeah i know i mean i oh i did there was <unk> i mean working you know live in brooklyn so it is the same thing and 
00:13:42	00:13:46	2	yeah maybe i'm just getting tired of it all i mean or 
00:14:09	00:14:10	1	like 
00:14:10	00:14:14	2	this is this really what it's all about um as do i really 
00:14:14	00:14:16	1	really want to be part of it 
00:14:16	00:14:24	2	you know because it's like you know it's not really what i am into you know the other <unk> the other side of it all the business the 
00:14:24	00:14:26	1	[noise] yeah the <unk> 
00:14:26	00:14:36	2	<unk> oh of the art making <unk> of the art world right you know and it's it's okay but it's it takes a lot of time and you know 
00:14:36	00:14:38	1	god you know 
00:14:38	00:14:45	2	[noise] and um you know all this you know writing grants and knowing that you know you probably won't get 'em and dealing with rejects 
00:14:45	00:14:53	1	i know <unk> not easy but i know it's part of it but you know what the hell is wrong with me 
00:14:53	00:14:59	2	i mean but you know part of this it's just part of it all you know and i know you know like working 
00:15:01	00:15:18	2	going to happen ten years from now or they can't you know like how long can i do this and what am i getting from it kind of thing right and uh you know <unk> are you saving money for the old age and shit like that you know it's just like you know who's going to you gotta think about 
00:15:25	00:15:26	1	wondering how could go back 
00:15:26	00:15:40	2	so when i'm thinking about ideal is trying to you know i'm doing <unk> working on that and you know try to change the time i go back to new york and try to keep trying to get in and try to get into the 
00:15:40	00:15:42	1	and and at some point 
00:15:42	00:15:49	2	in a couple of years by do ever get him then i have this possibility to like work there and 
00:15:49	00:15:55	1	yeah although i'm sure frank has told you that it's also not it hasn't been that easy for him 
00:15:55	00:16:01	2	well like in the beginning and the <unk> now he's getting work but in the beginning it wasn't so they're still like a kind of a rough transition 
00:16:01	00:16:10	1	yeah i can imagine where of yeah sure i mean it's not so easy i know but it's yeah it's getting connection that's like the same 
00:16:10	00:16:12	2	find getting connects people who knows 
00:16:12	00:16:13	1	right right right 
00:16:13	00:16:32	2	i mean that's what i do the idea but you know the question is if i want to go back to that <unk> you know doing keep on how long do i want to keep doing it right like how it could be able to do that when you're forty five yeah jeeze i think we should play lotto i think it'd be lot lot better and how's your little friend and 
00:16:32	00:16:33	1	yeah 
00:16:33	00:16:45	2	oh you mean this guy this guy this man that's stupid god well fucker [laughter] exactly why we're 
00:16:45	00:16:51	1	what's <unk> [laughter] he always good you there yeah i'm here 
00:16:51	00:17:03	2	supposed to come to my house the night before not the night before but the saturday night before i left before i came here <unk> he was just to come visit for like to see each other and have dinner or whatever talk whatever 
00:17:03	00:17:07	1	and he didn't come and he didn't call really and 
00:17:18	00:17:22	1	like lame way of like this you know like dealing with it 
00:17:25	00:17:38	1	really really bad because i it made me really bummed out 'cause i had really liked working there and he was one of the reasons why i really like working out so then you know after the sake of noxious thing i was like this is you know this <unk> this is 
00:17:38	00:17:43	2	yeah he's really badly so i'll be honest with you or i mean like 
00:17:43	00:17:46	1	so that's not you don't need that shed 
00:17:46	00:18:03	2	that's ridiculous i know and i <unk> i know and <unk> so i realized that howard so i realized that what was going on with that i was like that i was um projecting on to him who i i wanted him to be your who i've known he was like i i wasn't really looking
