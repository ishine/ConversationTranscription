00:25:37	00:25:50	2	and we we did talk about that but we'd probably will end up settling at home yeah you know what i mean eventually yeah i mean i don't know how long it you know you won't be tons of time 'cause then 'cause that would be hard to if you spent ten years 
00:25:50	00:25:53	1	here yeah i know that would be that would be 
00:25:53	00:25:55	2	heart wrenching 
00:25:55	00:25:59	1	and so yeah i think even five years as long

00:26:54	00:26:55	2	yeah like that 
00:26:55	00:26:57	1	we have to have an idea of 
00:26:57	00:27:01	2	going on right so that's what we decided that they would in a few years 
00:27:01	00:27:06	1	come back yeah after we had some kids here forget um [laughter] how many
