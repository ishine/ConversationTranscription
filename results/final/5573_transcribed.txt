00:00:10	00:00:11	1	[laughter] 
00:00:11	00:00:16	2	this is what i'm dealing with it this particular evening of my life i wanted fun

00:00:17	00:00:21	2	it was very funny hey well they give it to me so i can use it for my [laughter] 
00:00:21	00:00:24	1	probably not probably have to pay for it 
00:00:24	00:00:25	2	yeah i know 
00:00:25	00:00:33	1	i um actually this is the my last child was going to go back to my room i just called a bunch of times when you were on the phone 
00:00:33	00:00:51	2	oh i'm sorry yeah that was um okay my chinese speaking partner good for you who is having marital trouble oh oh i hear invited her over [noise] anyway um yeah so she's gonna come over saturday 
00:00:51	00:00:54	1	[noise] hi anyway hi how are you 
00:00:54	00:00:58	2	[laughter] i have a terrible cool 
00:00:58	00:01:01	1	yeah i was going to say you don't sound so hot 
00:01:01	00:01:05	2	yeah i feel pretty sick um how are you 
00:01:05	00:01:07	1	i'm good 
00:01:07	00:01:12	2	yeah that's good i mean i mean right now [laughter] 
00:01:12	00:01:13	1	not so good 
00:01:13	00:01:36	2	i know [laughter] i mean like in five minutes and then it could be depressing [laughter] no actually um the past two weeks have been wonderful except that i have this anthrax <unk> project hanging over my head and it's four days before it do by which point usually i'd be much more deeply into it in my view of right myself as a student and i'm very very nervous about this project and and even more nervous about this 
00:01:36	00:01:38	1	class um 
00:01:41	00:01:45	1	to spare for the past twenty four hours over the programs or 
00:01:45	00:01:56	2	okay actually i think that part of it has to do with my speaking with a ten you about it who's not sitting in the class and so the more widespread in liberal parameters of the project 
00:01:56	00:01:56	1	mhm 
00:01:56	00:02:05	2	he's not aware of and so i've been discussing with him you know whether it's going to work as a project or not and he tends to be on the negative whereas so [laughter] [laughter] 
00:02:05	00:02:06	1	being with my class tends to be 
00:02:06	00:02:10	2	towards the positive and i don't know i just 
00:02:10	00:02:11	1	frustrating 
00:02:11	00:02:16	2	yeah i'm going through these [noise] i have one ecstasy and many 
00:02:16	00:02:26	1	death in my <unk> but the great thing is if i finish this project then i can go back to my ecstasy project would keep me happy as long as i can pretend it's the only thing i 
00:02:26	00:02:30	2	to do good [laughter] have you um 
00:02:30	00:02:35	1	sent along that i probably spend them yet um i <unk> yeah so 
00:02:35	00:02:38	2	i'm working with on this project is really excited about them 
00:02:38	00:02:43	1	so in that case i will try to make a point to to actually sending them instead of reminding myself 
00:02:43	00:02:44	2	okay 
00:02:44	00:02:46	1	um let me tell you 
00:02:46	00:02:54	2	oh just so you can go to the library and check it out the textbooks that we're using [noise] not the textbook with the books that were using to unreliable 
00:02:54	00:02:56	1	work which actually 
00:02:56	00:03:05	2	i am <unk> just leave behind it and then i don't know how i managed like what type of the one thing that slept in i have to read on another hundred and eighteen pages 
00:03:05	00:03:06	1	mhm 
00:03:06	00:03:14	2	it's interesting but still not the kind of stuff you can sit down and swallow quickly um it's called do you have a pen 
00:03:14	00:03:18	1	um no okay well just write it on the stuff you're sending me right 
00:03:18	00:03:25	2	i can do that that would be cool um in fact i don't [noise] i think i can send you the entire reading 
00:03:25	00:03:29	1	um 'cause i'm only going to send you a couple of articles some of them are 
00:03:29	00:03:39	2	truly nasty to try to read [laughter] um i'm just warning you that's fine like when you read them remember i have no clue what they're about to if you have a group 
00:03:39	00:03:44	1	no i'm probably not even going to be the one reading them but she's <unk> she's compiling olivia 
00:03:44	00:03:45	2	so oh good 
00:03:45	00:03:50	1	no then she well um the one thing i will say is that i'm not sure 
00:03:50	00:03:57	2	what happens with copyright laws and harvard <unk> so um <unk> that's an interesting question 
00:03:57	00:04:00	1	she might want to um check into that just 
00:04:00	00:04:01	2	but if it's 
00:04:01	00:04:02	1	uh then again if it's just 
00:04:02	00:04:09	2	if it's a list and you know you can start they she could have found it anywhere and go chase down the articles herself yeah 
00:04:09	00:04:10	1	[noise] 
00:04:10	00:04:15	2	so [laughter] how many more about you besides the fact that you're ill and i want you to get better 
00:04:15	00:04:25	1	[laughter] i couldn't do that um let's see what else about me um cooking brunch this term it's really fun mhm 
00:04:25	00:04:27	2	<unk> for a hundred and fifty last weekend 
00:04:27	00:04:28	1	oh wow 
00:04:28	00:04:39	2	there's nothing quite like tracking two hundred and fifty eggs to scramble um [noise] i'm really panicked about this moving gig and how much 
00:04:39	00:04:43	1	<unk> yeah moving like what 
00:04:43	00:04:48	2	what the move or is going to cost and oh yeah that out and what first left and security's going to me 
00:04:48	00:04:49	1	mhm 
00:04:49	00:04:59	2	if we're even going to be able to find an apartment anyway and what we're going to do if we can't find an apartment and um you name it i'm probably panicking about it 
00:04:59	00:05:00	1	have you checked into those 
00:05:00	00:05:01	2	about 
00:05:01	00:05:04	1	apartment buildings in san francisco they are all seven sisters 
00:05:04	00:05:12	2	no my first year i think the <unk> of these rumors floated around that and i 
00:05:12	00:05:14	1	ugly familiar to me but i had forgotten 
00:05:14	00:05:15	2	yeah 
00:05:15	00:05:19	1	that's an interesting thought i don't think we could sell heather on it but it might be worth a try 
00:05:19	00:05:23	2	no but it might be some place to stay until you find some place where we 
00:05:27	00:05:34	2	six week fellowship that she's applying for attracts people from all over the place and so they send out information a temporary housing 
00:05:34	00:05:36	1	[laughter] that is 
00:05:36	00:05:38	2	into their program so 
00:05:38	00:05:39	1	yeah 
00:05:47	00:05:52	1	well yeah i remember this particular situation for me to sit and wait 
00:05:52	00:05:56	2	yeah [laughter] so we're panicked 
00:05:56	00:05:58	1	yeah you will survive it though 
00:05:58	00:06:08	2	that's what they told me [noise] um i applied for two jobs and now that my reality for the first time last week which was not as big as scary as i thought it was going to be 
00:06:08	00:06:10	1	i mean i am feeling all this fear i 
00:06:10	00:06:15	2	compiled in the last job hunting but [noise] it was still easier to mail out the rest of my like my resume better 
00:06:27	00:06:30	1	and oh well i can't figure out how i 
00:06:30	00:06:39	2	be qualified to make thirty four i i know i'm worth that much any more but um i can't imagine why anyone would want to pay a social worker with my little experience 
00:06:39	00:06:43	1	much well are they advertising for that level of 
00:07:03	00:07:04	1	yeah 
00:07:19	00:07:23	2	hey you know i'd probably have to wear a suit but we're <unk> 
00:07:23	00:07:25	1	for your for thirty four [laughter] 
00:07:25	00:07:27	2	you looked really nice in the seat you got one and everything 
00:07:27	00:07:32	1	and i think that i know enough more about clothing now that i could find more comfortable 
00:07:32	00:07:38	2	you know i feel they recommend along the ones but then again you out to long skirt 
00:07:45	00:07:52	2	[noise] i'm trying to think if i've but i guess i guess most of the <unk> i've seen you wearing have been long they've just been in a very different 
00:08:06	00:08:07	2	yeah yeah 
00:08:07	00:08:08	1	mhm 
00:08:08	00:08:21	2	okay so yeah um and the other one is with lutheran lutheran social services doing case management with h._i._v. positive folks um which i could do but i don't really want to do yeah more because they don't want to do it um do 'em guess management 
00:08:21	00:08:22	1	yeah 
00:08:22	00:08:40	2	we find working with um a <unk> organization again so [noise] you don't know we'll see what happens well um yeah [noise] so do you like not email or what's the deal 
00:08:43	00:08:46	2	or is it just like i haven't had time to eat right around a letter 
00:08:46	00:08:54	1	you haven't had time to write a letter i'm sure i'm i've gotten shorty meals okay i haven't gotten one for a couple of weeks though 
00:08:54	00:08:58	2	yeah i'm sorry i don't know what's wrong with <unk> like okay 
00:08:58	00:09:00	1	no problem i just wanted to make sure that it 
00:09:00	00:09:03	2	with the life thing it's a little [laughter] yeah like 
00:09:03	00:09:08	1	you mean there's something i have to do besides books like eating has been a problem 
00:09:22	00:09:24	1	so you go to 
00:09:24	00:09:27	2	[laughter] yeah i get into bed turn on mash watching go to sleep 
00:09:31	00:09:34	2	okay sleeping is good eating is important 
00:09:34	00:09:38	1	is important i'm having a lot of trouble with that um particularly getting to the grocery store 
00:09:41	00:09:44	1	see this in depression and older people all the time yeah 
00:09:44	00:09:58	2	[laughter] actually i can say that this in particular is not it it can cause depression but this in particular is not a matter of depression and a matter of [laughter] i've never lived alone i'm very used to cooking for two when i cook 
00:09:58	00:09:59	1	yeah um 
00:09:59	00:10:02	2	[noise] when i came home from work in japan 
00:10:02	00:10:08	1	be it at midnight i knew that intel whatever time i had to go to work the next morning 
00:10:08	00:10:10	2	i didn't have to deal with 
00:10:14	00:10:17	2	it's really difficult because you can never straw 
00:10:35	00:10:39	1	because i mean when it comes down to you know i can take 
00:10:39	00:10:46	2	forty five minutes <unk> peel vegetables and cut them up and do whatever to them 
00:10:46	00:10:47	1	or i can 
00:10:47	00:10:51	2	study right except i mean i know i know 
00:10:51	00:10:53	1	that is mhm 
00:10:53	00:10:56	2	um and i i knew i would do that if i were a student 
00:10:56	00:10:58	1	[noise] 
00:10:58	00:11:16	2	and living and having to feed myself but um i also did it in korea i did it with money interestingly enough it was like no i'm not going to you know by this food because they need to save the money and i mean it was getting ridiculous here and eat the food you have to do it yeah not optional 
00:11:16	00:11:23	1	well i mean it's not that i'm missing meals okay not eating healthy food i'm like 
00:11:23	00:11:24	2	but 
00:11:24	00:11:29	1	healthy and my eating spectrum is my usual dinner which 
00:11:29	00:11:37	2	well let's see i have some zucchini i have some some or squash i have some dried cranberries i have some rice and i have an onion 
00:11:37	00:11:44	1	and i'm going to do is i'm going to chop all of it up stir fry it and put water in it and wait till the racist and eat part of it and put the rest of the refrigerator 
00:11:44	00:11:53	2	and eat it and they <unk> makes sense yeah um that's however supposing that i've had time to go grocery shopping right 
00:11:53	00:11:57	1	which anyway [noise] the other thing is that it's just no fun to cook 
00:11:57	00:12:03	2	one person i know and what the hell do you do is you eat [laughter] i know [laughter] 
00:12:03	00:12:09	1	i mean i've started eating on the bed which is something i tried not to do sitting on the bed eating watching television i like

00:12:12	00:12:14	1	um 
00:12:14	00:12:16	2	anyway so that's like the big 
00:12:16	00:12:21	1	the big thing that i'm looking forward to nathaniel coming well no that's not a big 
00:12:21	00:12:28	2	put that is one of the thing yeah it helps when is he'll be back december systems or when he first

00:19:25	00:19:27	2	[noise] so 
00:19:27	00:19:29	1	[noise] wow 
00:19:29	00:19:44	2	yeah so there's that and um but that's not like you know news at the moment or anything that's just something i'm thinking about that i want to do that now and um the other thing is i've been thinking about and i i think i've pretty much just decided not to do it but i was thinking about being an egg donor actually 
00:19:44	00:19:46	1	oh wow 
00:19:46	00:19:54	2	medicine clinic [noise] um [noise] largely because it paid fifteen hundred dollars [laughter] but i went in for the preliminary exam 
00:19:54	00:19:58	1	um an interview but just yesterday 
00:19:58	00:20:06	2	[noise] and aside from it sounded kind of scary i mean i could probably do scary for fifteen hundred dollars [laughter] um 
00:20:06	00:20:10	1	it's like a two to three months process which i don't have and so 
00:20:10	00:20:11	2	yeah 
00:20:11	00:20:15	1	but i did find out that i have excepted lee positioned ovaries and 
00:20:15	00:20:16	2	um so 
00:20:16	00:20:18	1	maybe at some point in the future 
00:20:18	00:20:21	2	kind of sucks though to fifteen hundred dollars or to come in handy 
00:20:21	00:20:23	1	well there's always san francisco 
00:20:23	00:20:32	2	right right i figure it's probably not exactly a novelty out there [noise] so that's something i may do at some point in the future though on the way home on the bus and thinking 
00:20:32	00:20:39	1	i'm like selling my body here they call it oh donations but they pay you fifteen hundred dollars to do it so it really donation 
00:20:39	00:20:41	2	that's very interest 
00:20:56	00:20:59	1	yeah i i kind of heard something about that 
00:20:59	00:21:00	2	mhm 
00:21:00	00:21:02	1	[noise] so 
00:21:02	00:21:11	2	<unk> which is really interesting so ooh my ovaries on the little screen and oh it didn't hurt [laughter] easier than a public 
00:21:11	00:21:17	1	oh god i have to go in and have one but i haven't had one in over a year no usually have a memory all <unk> 
00:21:24	00:21:30	1	bad thing no that's okay i've been meaning to do it for two weeks it's just when i have the time you know

00:21:40	00:21:45	1	so you're not coming out to see me huh [laughter] this this fall you're not going to get to see 
00:21:45	00:21:46	2	i'm sorry [laughter] 
00:21:46	00:21:48	1	the last time we talk to you you thought you might 
00:21:48	00:21:57	2	i know i thought i'd love to but i think i think there's probably [noise] oh my god 
00:21:57	00:22:00	1	okay so it's okay 
00:22:00	00:22:02	2	part of what's see i have this 
00:22:02	00:22:11	1	being paper that i'm really excited about that i'm going to do about ten times too much work on a good time because that means that i'm doing like <unk> like as well as i did 'em on <unk> 
00:22:11	00:22:13	2	right um 
00:22:29	00:22:31	1	my mom comes swimming like 
00:22:31	00:22:44	2	twelve or something for thanksgiving oh my god i don't know she's going to be here for some ungodly long time and then you'd <unk> coming out too yeah he's coming out in the morning of thanksgiving he and my brother will arrive and that they'll only in the 
00:22:44	00:22:44	1	mhm 
00:22:44	00:22:47	2	the day after all of them leave <unk> coming 
00:22:47	00:22:49	1	<unk> 
00:22:49	00:22:57	2	so november is like oh my god i mean in a way it's really good because it will get me to win the piano gets 'cause this month it's been so long 
00:22:57	00:22:59	1	i have never experienced 
00:22:59	00:23:05	2	such a long month in my life mm oh you mean july was like that 
00:23:12	00:23:18	2	summer's here it means nothing is coming home now it's right and i might be able to take myself that way for twenty one days <unk> 
00:23:18	00:23:20	1	but 
00:23:20	00:23:22	2	but on the other hadn't really scared 
00:23:22	00:23:24	1	since i have all this work 
00:23:24	00:23:44	2	the main thing is that the answer a class and i'm having trouble with um you know i take two uh about a month just in the writing over twenty page paper not talking about any of the research and we this class this answer a class has this ah paper that's due on monday uh five page paper it twenty page paper in a final take an exam 
00:23:44	00:23:45	1	which 
00:23:45	00:23:48	2	a little heavy but anyway um 
00:23:48	00:23:50	1	it does seem rather heavy yeah the thing is 
00:23:50	00:24:06	2	that the the papers are cumulative in a way so i cannot dart on the twenty page paper until after i turned in the front page paper which scaring the shit out of me beyond that the day after that paper is do i have my take on final from my law class do and 
00:24:06	00:24:08	1	i hate to i mean 
00:24:08	00:24:17	2	this is like a completely different from the whole discussion that you and i have in the snow will never admit to my parents who fought i should take the sociology class this site 
00:24:17	00:24:20	1	i would write to take the law class for the reasons 
00:24:20	00:24:25	2	that i was considering mhm but my mind is not interacting with that in 
00:24:25	00:24:27	1	[laughter] 
00:24:34	00:24:35	1	yeah 
00:24:35	00:24:41	2	besides that i managed to make these stupidest comments of the year every time i open my mouth and that class 
00:24:41	00:24:41	1	right 
00:24:41	00:24:52	2	so i just sit in the back or actually it's in the front row which is awful 'cause i mean <unk> they're all thinking i'm stupid and i it's really weird because i think people much because the way people sit 
00:24:52	00:24:53	1	i am 
00:24:53	00:24:59	2	isolated like no one ever sits in the room right so i'm like oh my god i'm a logical 
00:24:59	00:25:09	1	oh you're you're taking a class and you're not a law student i mean nobody knows you laid probably all know each other yeah anyway i don't have to 
00:25:09	00:25:23	2	utah shit i know it's just i dread that class and right now i'm dreading the answer class which it hopefully just this week i don't know but so i have these two other big things do but the good thing about this is the law classes 
00:25:23	00:25:25	1	done by the time to federal gets home 
00:25:25	00:25:26	2	potentially the take 
00:25:26	00:25:30	1	final is given to us in the last day of class um 
00:25:30	00:25:31	2	which is when the paper 
00:25:31	00:25:36	1	do which is they're basically they're two days after 
00:25:36	00:25:50	2	after my law final after i'm done with everything for the pre break part intimate samuel comes home yes so if i can like get a significant portion of the take 'em and find that he was first draft of to take 'em final 
00:25:50	00:25:52	1	for any throw done 
00:25:52	00:25:53	2	and then not only leaves too 
00:26:05	00:26:08	1	in other cases i would be in china 
00:26:08	00:26:12	2	yeah but no they say well the chinese class is going to be like every third day 
00:26:12	00:26:16	1	this time so you have to stay here [noise] um for the chinese final 
00:26:16	00:26:20	2	so and the thing comes on the twenty first the chinese finals on the eight 
00:26:20	00:26:26	1	and let's be realistic except for the fact that i have to keep the stuff in my mind is not like i'm going to study straight through for this chinese 
00:26:26	00:26:39	2	i mean it's my knees you know what the cumulative you learn it you know only so much you can do with language if you don't understand it [laughter] um and then my history find though is the only thing left and it's like on the twenty sixth of genuine or something 
00:26:39	00:26:41	1	he's going to take a lot of times a lot of work but 
00:26:41	00:26:45	2	hey not 'til a couple of weeks before 
00:26:45	00:26:48	1	yeah well no it's not that i mean i can spread it out well 
00:26:51	00:26:52	1	but you have a break 
00:26:52	00:26:57	2	yeah you still can't spend like three weeks all right [laughter] right so you can 
00:26:57	00:27:00	1	but you'd probably exploding and then what would be the <unk> 
00:27:00	00:27:08	2	yeah um so i think well maybe if i sit here for three weeks old actually remember some of it passes the second week of next semester 
00:27:08	00:27:11	1	[noise] [laughter] 
00:27:14	00:27:16	1	that is nice 
00:27:21	00:27:42	2	[laughter] <unk> actually i'm surprisingly relaxed and taking all of this an emotional stride except my depression this morning um [noise] but but just like time wise none of the people i want to see and spend time with mhm you hell india is she in do you know her she's in <unk> 
00:27:42	00:27:45	1	oh yeah yeah like 
00:27:45	00:28:04	2	[laughter] i'm like walking across the street in harvard square they hear honk and she goes like driving by oh my god this is a woman who i want to get to know more than almost any one i can think of and i haven't even had time to call her and that happened like two weeks and i don't know she was out there who yeah i knew she was here and i hadn't called her and saw her and i haven't called her and she has no way to find me and i know how to find her and 
00:28:07	00:28:16	2	yeah i still don't have gory phone number speaking if people so you don't have time to get in touch with but um she does have yours so i don't think she'll call usually 
00:28:16	00:28:17	1	[noise] 
00:28:17	00:28:18	2	probably is 
00:28:18	00:28:19	1	yeah 
00:28:19	00:28:25	2	[noise] yeah i just figured at least you guys might kind of run into each other at some point at least you all know each other it's there 
00:28:25	00:28:27	1	yeah that is good 
00:28:27	00:28:28	2	<unk>

00:29:24	00:29:31	2	yeah well it has its good points and bad points personally is horrible because we like <unk> very much
