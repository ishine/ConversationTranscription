00:18:16	00:18:17	1	<unk> 
00:18:17	00:18:20	2	decent place [laughter] 
00:18:20	00:18:21	1	eat out

00:18:27	00:18:30	2	since he retired 
00:18:30	00:18:33	1	she gets them out and get some going i think i think that's nice 
00:18:33	00:18:39	2	yeah no usually go out against for dinner 
00:18:39	00:18:55	1	uh-huh we eat out almost every night that um <unk> as a worker that she goes out with their work or to eat and i know it's just gotten to the place it's just easier for us to eat out as it is to try to cook at home it teams 
00:18:55	00:19:01	2	what is <unk> you got a house we bought a different 
00:19:01	00:19:04	1	house down the street and 
00:19:04	00:19:20	2	we're still in the process of trying to get somebody to live here with or maybe two other handicapped girls to live in this house with her [noise] and we're going to be having a meeting soon to talk about it again but 
00:19:20	00:19:21	1	worked out yeah 
00:19:21	00:19:27	2	we don't have it in in in place yet but the s. c. where 
00:19:27	00:19:35	1	who has killings program is in favor of it and um they're you know they are 
00:19:35	00:19:37	2	[noise] i 
00:19:37	00:19:39	1	starting to 
00:19:39	00:19:40	2	[noise] 
00:19:41	00:19:49	2	uh talk about it and make plans but it's awfully slow but at least they are 
00:19:49	00:19:54	1	they are considering it now and it may not work i don't know it's it's 
00:19:54	00:19:55	2	[noise] 
00:19:55	00:19:56	1	it's awfully confining 
00:19:56	00:19:57	2	but 
00:19:57	00:20:01	1	killing matured a lot and most of the time she's pretty cool 
00:20:01	00:20:09	2	pretty and uh hopefully it will work out because i don't know what the option so it'd be otherwise 
00:20:09	00:20:12	1	[noise] it just depends 
00:20:12	00:20:14	2	we can find the right person 
00:20:14	00:20:18	1	you know to to stay with it 
00:20:18	00:20:25	2	and now again it seems like you know so many people are in public <unk> and they really just don't wanna work 
00:20:25	00:20:27	1	oh yeah 
00:20:27	00:20:29	2	that's true 
00:20:29	00:20:32	1	and you can't have anybody either 
00:20:32	00:20:35	2	that's right it's going to take a special person 
00:20:35	00:20:47	1	so it's it if you have two other handicapped people um once you need more than one or not i still 
00:20:47	00:20:58	2	like to see kill and continue the programme she's in where she would go out you know in the evening with a worker because she looks forward to that so much and that gives her some socialization 
00:20:58	00:20:58	1	hum 
00:20:58	00:21:03	2	keeps in touch with the community and really just makes you a day 
00:21:03	00:21:04	1	mhm 
00:21:04	00:21:12	2	um and i i don't know you know there's still a lot we need to to think about and talking about 
00:21:12	00:21:15	1	yes and she'd been in a program where she works during the day 
00:21:15	00:21:20	2	yes uh-huh she still does that right uh-huh 
00:21:20	00:21:25	1	she she goes out to be a c. and so she leaves the house about seven thirty and gets home about three thirty 
00:21:25	00:21:26	2	[noise] 
00:21:26	00:21:32	1	and hopefully we can find somebody that would just live in and be like a house parent 
00:21:32	00:21:33	2	mhm
