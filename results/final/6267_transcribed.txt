00:00:00	00:00:01	1	[noise] 
00:00:01	00:00:12	2	okay okay so we're in it and the reason why i'm doing this uh-huh is cause i get ah twenty bucks oh we're each each time i call somebody oh relatively two times 
00:00:12	00:00:15	1	what's what's the point of this research 
00:00:15	00:00:18	2	i don't know i guess they're going to analyze uh you know like uh 
00:00:18	00:00:21	1	i called the lady and uh i found out that 
00:00:21	00:00:27	2	you know they're probably going to analyze like when people talk about [noise] slang and yeah actions or whatever 
00:00:27	00:00:31	1	interesting okay 
00:00:31	00:00:34	2	i thought gee i thought you were going to call a couple of weeks ago 
00:00:34	00:00:36	1	yeah huh well 
00:00:36	00:00:39	2	been kind of busy less um 
00:00:39	00:00:40	1	see oh okay 
00:00:40	00:00:54	2	daddy we um we became citizens just friday mhm so we were kind of busy doing that but oh daddy hasn't really i don't even know if he if he wants to go or it's up to him 
00:01:18	00:01:32	2	where um i have to schedule people who need emergency calls or whatever onto 'em whenever technicians available at the time you <unk> i don't know they say it's stressful because um a lot yeah 
00:01:32	00:01:36	1	and it will take it it's like nine one one mhm mhm do there are very high 
00:01:36	00:01:37	2	yeah 
00:01:37	00:01:41	1	so they they say that a lot of people won't take it and stuff things like that and i'll be doing 
00:01:41	00:01:49	2	cause you get chewed out on the phone oh yeah yeah you know if you're in uh if if one of the appliances breaks or something like that 
00:01:49	00:01:50	1	yeah i know 
00:01:50	00:01:57	2	you know you <unk> been people you know what you said that your beep in trust because i pay money for your 
00:01:57	00:02:05	1	actually i would be getting it from the technicians not from the customers yes some customers i would because i would have to call them if i can't scheduled them for a call 
00:02:23	00:02:31	1	<unk> and then you're telling them to go yeah exactly oh i see mhm so i may be chewed up by them not by the customers are per se mhm 
00:02:31	00:02:34	2	even though you know even so how do you pick 
00:02:38	00:02:40	1	well i i'm having a really strict 
00:02:40	00:02:44	2	training yet but i must start training next week yeah and um 
00:02:45	00:03:01	2	somewhere you know they would look at the technicians and exactly what the customer requested <unk> area they're in and you have to find out what technicians working in that area and so forth [noise] oh well if you're going to transfer they would know would that make it a lot more difficult for you to come up here 
00:03:01	00:03:03	1	<unk> yeah [laughter] 
00:03:03	00:03:05	2	really well okay well first 
00:03:05	00:03:13	1	this is what i found out first of all there is no openings over there uh-huh right now they only open easy habits for telemarketing that's it 
00:03:13	00:03:22	2	uh-huh <unk> open [noise] and telemarketers get paid less telemarketers get paid more uh-huh but i've already done that for a whole year and i don't really like it 
00:03:24	00:03:29	2	well i mean it's it's from the <unk> again now it'd probably be a dollar more mhm 
00:03:29	00:03:31	1	hour yeah that would look 
00:03:31	00:03:34	2	but i don't like it i mean 
00:03:37	00:03:42	2	from working in dispatch customer service and telemarketer if i ever find a new job 
00:03:42	00:03:45	1	uh-huh i am going to be better prepared 
00:03:48	00:03:50	1	two years or three years 
00:03:50	00:03:56	2	oh i've had dispatch i've had to you know i've had um a year of um 
00:03:56	00:03:59	1	clerical oh that how to your children 
00:03:59	00:04:12	2	okay granted well let me be easier for you to find a job you may be harder for you to find a a well paying job because usually well paying jobs demand specialization in the field you know stan 
00:04:12	00:04:13	1	yeah like 
00:04:13	00:04:15	2	yeah but like 
00:04:15	00:04:16	1	like that i mean let's let's take it 
00:04:16	00:04:28	2	donald's as as a point let's say you've had you've had one of your experience flipping burgers when your experience using uh you know frying fries right and one of your experience as a cashier okay 
00:04:30	00:04:46	2	you go out to the job market you can probably find a job quick you know because you you know specialize let's say that there was a cashiers jobs that uh you know uh was paying a lot more but they need they wanted a lot of people with with you know more experience [noise] 
00:04:48	00:04:49	2	hello 
00:04:49	00:04:54	1	yeah yeah well i i very much south you can really compare mean to a person that works at mcdonalds 
00:05:05	00:05:10	1	it does you know let's say let's say that it's uh you know say it's <unk> okay 
00:05:10	00:05:15	2	you know and then you have you know when cash hearing job one job and working and and tori 
00:05:15	00:05:21	1	you know like the name doesn't really matter okay well my point is is the uh experience 
00:05:21	00:05:31	2	uh-huh and well that's what i mean i mean <unk> if if i have specialization in three areas uh compared to one 
00:05:31	00:05:34	1	do you call a specialized he's only been there one year though 
00:05:44	00:05:55	2	i've been very productive <unk> in those two areas so far <unk> marketing i was very good at <unk> i was always above a hundred percent 
00:05:55	00:05:55	1	mhm 
00:05:55	00:05:58	2	so and so forth clerical i'm above my expectation too 
00:05:58	00:06:00	1	oh i see okay so 
00:06:00	00:06:10	2	i'm able to change over from one area to another learn to adapt and do so well the i think that's a very good point in my area okay and if i transferred 
00:06:10	00:06:12	1	dispatch which is which is a very high 
00:06:12	00:06:15	2	environment and if i'm able to do that 
00:06:17	00:06:25	2	did you do well ours productivity and getting people to cooperate with me i mean that's far more experienced than 
00:06:25	00:06:27	1	anything else that i could have i can imagine 
00:06:27	00:06:32	2	far as telemarketing ever you know ice skate two or three years and telemarketing you know compared to 
00:06:32	00:06:34	1	being able to change 
00:06:34	00:06:36	2	place to another and 
00:06:49	00:06:51	1	well you're going to take it 
00:06:51	00:06:52	2	what 
00:06:52	00:06:54	1	uh this 
00:06:54	00:07:04	2	uh-huh i i requested it attacked uh-huh i'm kind of i i really don't like [noise] my clerical job because um the people i'm around 
00:07:04	00:07:07	1	um too many people i mean really <unk> 
00:07:07	00:07:14	2	the supervisors there okay we have we have one main supervisor into assistant supervisors 
00:07:14	00:07:15	1	well when the main supper 
00:07:22	00:07:24	1	they don't do a good job 
00:07:24	00:07:37	2	and i've already i already went to the head person about this and everything and they got to talk to and they were good for a while and then bam it's again you know same thing you see so much favoritism going on 
00:07:37	00:07:41	1	they finally because you know every single day i always work late 
00:07:50	00:07:52	1	nine o'clock you get overtime for gas 
00:07:52	00:08:12	2	i do get overtime but if i stayed six minutes [noise] overtime i do not get paid for that six minutes and during the six and and there had been plenty of times i've sat there and i've had it you know hurry and rational and blah blah blah things like that just because you know they don't want to being overtime or whatever but nine o'clock nine o'clock strikes 
00:08:12	00:08:18	1	should be able to get out just like everybody else 'cause i'm not getting paid for those extra minutes mhm i'm there 
00:08:18	00:08:20	2	and then you you said you were only 
00:08:20	00:08:21	1	only seven minutes and after 
00:08:21	00:08:22	2	oh okay 
00:08:22	00:08:25	1	yeah and the thing is is i don't goof around or anything 
00:08:25	00:08:27	2	you know it's not like i <unk> 
00:08:27	00:08:29	1	talk strikes and 
00:08:29	00:08:33	2	them you know i'm sitting there spending five minutes getting ready nothing like that 
00:08:33	00:08:35	1	those men 
00:08:35	00:08:36	2	after nine o'clock 
00:08:36	00:08:38	1	i spend working 
00:08:38	00:08:48	2	you know and that's what gets me really mad and i've done this for a very long time but everybody else in clerical don't don't do that because everybody just leave you know and they don't get to talk to 
00:08:48	00:08:48	1	nothing 
00:08:48	00:08:59	2	you know i'm always stuck getting their late and then not just that but um also the assistance i mean finally on uh just last saturday i mean i was just 
00:08:59	00:09:01	1	so mad because they 
00:09:01	00:09:03	2	scheduled me by myself 
00:09:03	00:09:05	1	so from eight three to five thirty 
00:09:05	00:09:13	2	um everybody left at five o'clock so i had half an hour by myself we originally find the whole entire day but finally when when those 
00:09:13	00:09:14	1	two other critical people left 
00:09:22	00:09:25	1	people were coming up to me asking me questions 
00:09:25	00:09:35	2	this is assistance supervisors didn't nothing i ended up staying there 'til six o'clock when after five thirty they started <unk> and i was getting close to six o'clock but they didn't help me 
00:09:35	00:09:45	1	mm i mean that is their job you know i mean if you know if they see me falling behind wherever they don't it's not their job to you know be behind mean and brag about how late it is 
00:09:45	00:09:50	2	<unk> i'm sitting there working i'm wasn't taking my my sweet time i'm very 
00:09:50	00:09:51	1	i'm very fast 
00:09:51	00:09:52	2	yes 
00:09:52	00:09:57	1	you know and it just got me so mad you know that that that they're you know there's 
00:09:57	00:10:08	2	gosh you know it really got me nuts i just ask for transfer <unk> you know and finally there's um so there was this opening and and i talk to them and they said fine i mean i had 
00:10:08	00:10:10	1	i had a supervisor put in a good 
00:10:10	00:10:11	2	worked for me mhm 
00:10:11	00:10:13	1	you know and i think that got me 
00:10:13	00:10:15	2	we try and get paid more 
00:10:15	00:10:19	1	no i actually i think i get the same pay mhm 
00:10:19	00:10:21	2	um for for more stress 
00:10:21	00:10:22	1	it's a different 
00:10:22	00:10:24	2	mm for more stress 
00:10:24	00:10:25	1	well you see 
00:10:25	00:10:34	2	it might not be more stressed me mhm i mean what was stressing me out was the environment i was in in that i mean that was every single night 
00:10:40	00:11:01	2	well see i mean you know if it's more stressful than i put myself in that situation but if it's not and if i can handle it you know hey that's that's fine i mean i can always you know learn to deal with work work isn't really what scares me it's it's the the work environment that i mean 
00:11:01	00:11:05	1	well you know i mean you like what i understand like you right now it's like uh 
00:11:05	00:11:09	2	oh he ethics ethics around my workplace 
00:11:09	00:11:13	1	but i'm i'm saying i don't understand it's like it's an awesome time for you to come up now 
00:11:13	00:11:19	2	um because like around the holidays people are moving out and stuff so you can probably find it plays pretty good 
00:11:19	00:11:20	1	yeah you know if you speed 
00:11:20	00:11:23	2	within the same job environment 
00:11:23	00:11:29	1	um within the same department but transferred up here you know chances are he probably won't get stuck working with the same kinds of people 
00:11:29	00:11:36	2	that's true but you know what i heard i heard that the people over there are even worse mhm 
00:11:36	00:11:39	1	um how do they know that stuff 
00:12:04	00:12:07	1	okay very very very strict 
00:12:07	00:12:18	2	and they want her to go over there to get the place together you know and it's i mean the people there are just from what i hear from her and she's and i mean she's really um 
00:12:18	00:12:19	1	mhm 
00:12:19	00:12:26	2	not a person to be done it or anything but when she went over there she told me it was really bad i mean people do 
00:12:26	00:12:27	1	ever they want 
00:12:27	00:12:39	2	hardly anybody there knew what they were supposed to do i mean no one knew the system nothing you know things like that and she had to retrain people and and regroup people 
00:12:39	00:12:40	1	and and she says that she still 
00:12:40	00:12:52	2	housing problems now as it is you know that there's a lot of people there who who worked there for very long time and used to that environment you already used to the fact that they could do whatever they want blah blah blah and things like that 
00:12:52	00:12:53	1	and you know me i'm a very 
00:12:53	00:13:03	2	i'm very by the book person uh-huh and um since working in clerical i've seen so much stuff that's been going around and there had been people there who were 
00:13:03	00:13:06	1	very long time and i you know i finally got fed up 
00:13:06	00:13:13	2	and i told the boss you know certain things that they were going on and so on and so forth and yeah 
00:13:13	00:13:17	1	you know i i've learned a lot of i've actually probably made 
00:13:17	00:13:18	2	quite a bit of enemies you know 
00:13:18	00:13:21	1	but at this point i really don't care 
00:13:21	00:13:23	2	if i make enemies you know 
00:13:23	00:13:24	1	it's like i just 
00:13:24	00:13:26	2	i'm doing my job 
00:13:26	00:13:31	1	but they make my work really hard for me well they have seniority 
00:13:31	00:13:37	2	so if i didn't call then you how long would it taking you for you to you know like what caused like you know 
00:13:37	00:13:40	1	i mean 'cause you know i had i was really hoping for you to come up here 
00:13:40	00:13:47	2	well you see the thing is is that i still don't know if i can or if i can't my supervisor has been on vacation 
00:13:47	00:13:49	1	for two weeks now and then 
00:13:49	00:13:51	2	recently she just went on a seminar 
00:13:51	00:13:52	1	for a week 
00:13:52	00:13:54	2	so i really haven't had a chance to 
00:13:54	00:13:59	1	to her and i have to go by her book verification book 
00:13:59	00:14:03	2	so once i once i'm able to go and talk to her

00:26:43	00:26:53	1	and stuff like that and that's why she wants me but but you know as far as as far as i was actually talking to each other we never really much gone along as far as that game 
00:26:53	00:26:57	2	oh okay well then like if you come up here like 
00:26:57	00:27:05	1	don't you think you can relate to me somehow you know and you know don't you think that you can probably feel some sort of semblance of closest to me you not entirely complete but 
00:27:05	00:27:10	2	you're so busy doing your own stuff i mean it's not like i mean you're you're very busy

00:27:27	00:27:29	2	okay so yeah what what's up 
00:27:29	00:27:35	1	okay it's just different [laughter] this is different than 
00:27:35	00:27:38	2	you know what i mean that's a valid excuse he thinks 
00:27:38	00:27:40	1	way different 
00:27:43	00:27:45	1	this anymore [laughter] 
00:27:45	00:27:54	2	you know i mean granted yeah you know i could probably talk to you and zones over but i don't i don't think you'll you'll really understand where i'm i'm kim 
00:27:54	00:27:56	1	okay and 
00:27:56	00:27:58	2	it's going to have you ever thought that how long 
00:27:58	00:28:00	1	well do you mean of course i have 
00:28:00	00:28:03	2	i mean wouldn't know where you actually feel alone all the time 
00:28:03	00:28:05	1	<unk> yeah 
00:28:05	00:28:09	2	we talking about you and i was growing up and stuff yeah 
00:28:09	00:28:11	1	no but what about now 
00:28:11	00:28:19	2	well now you know i i'm more settled and stuff right and you probably are also more settled right and and i'm also 
00:28:19	00:28:23	1	no i don't i don't really have any close friends i have a few close friends 
00:28:23	00:28:34	2	and and okay and let let's say for example you tell me all your palms and so and so forth and then i ask you to come up here okay 'cause i think it's better environment for you 
00:28:34	00:28:36	1	mhm are you willing to leave 
00:28:36	00:28:38	2	all that 
00:28:47	00:29:06	2	well the reason why i thought it would be good for you to come up here is the first of all you're complaining about like daddy and stuff and how he was like taking advantage of you and stuff and jump right ah and also uh i felt that in santiago isn't there anymore you don't really have a much of a much in terms of national support 
00:29:06	00:29:06	1	mhm 
00:29:06	00:29:11	2	mhm mhm well actually me and him are not together anymore i know 
00:29:11	00:29:18	1	so uh is not true you still have you not have much of an emotional support that's not true anymore 
00:29:18	00:29:22	2	oh that's not true anymore yeah okay so there's somebody you can talk to him 
00:29:22	00:29:25	1	uh-huh okay oh there's somebody from work 
00:29:25	00:29:40	2	yes okay that's good yeah and plus i mean you know what let me tell you something when when we broke up um we still sound a lot of time together and stuff and since then i've been able to 
00:29:40	00:29:42	1	talk to him he's been able to talk to 
00:29:42	00:29:54	2	and we actually listen to each other now stuff like that you know and i mean it's like i just you know what i'm i'm really surprised because 
00:29:54	00:29:56	1	all my life
