00:00:21	00:00:22	1	mhm 
00:00:22	00:00:30	2	well i have really i don't have too much news you're the one with the news yeah you're the one who is outgoing thing tell me about the seven forty 
00:00:30	00:00:36	1	uh well <unk> it's it's so tied up right now oh i have um 
00:00:36	00:00:49	2	put a deposit on it i went over to buy it and the man didn't have a title mhm and come to find out what had happened he has some ah his lebanese he's been living over here for his lebanese and he's been in america 
00:00:49	00:00:51	1	oh mhm 
00:00:51	00:00:58	2	and um what is ended up happening it's turned out to be quite an answer to prayer because number one i needed a car 
00:00:58	00:01:01	1	and i um 
00:01:01	00:01:03	2	[noise] had looked at a member of cheaper cars 
00:01:03	00:01:05	1	[noise] man 
00:01:05	00:01:25	2	through prayer you know the thing that came to me was to pray for what i want it well you know i still didn't want to spend a lot of money and so on but i did one of the ball though i didn't want to seven forty um and if not a seven forty in eighty six or newer oh so that's what i prayed for forty that was eighty six or <unk> or i would take um 
00:01:25	00:01:25	1	mhm 
00:01:25	00:01:38	2	i'd taken the eighty five seven forty mhm so what i ended up finding was an eighty seven seven forty oh that needs work mhm and uh uh looked it up in the book 
00:01:38	00:01:39	1	me neither head gasket 
00:01:39	00:01:50	2	and i looked it up to see if that was a job i felt like doing and um it'll be the biggest job i've ever done on a car but i think i'll go ahead and give it a try mhm and um 
00:01:50	00:01:57	2	but the bottom line is you may remember my mentioning some while back that i was preaching in alaska uh back in january 
00:01:57	00:01:58	1	right 
00:01:58	00:02:07	2	and uh making a long story short through the course of that service i began to feel like i needed to be engaged and outrage

00:02:09	00:02:10	2	you're in uh

00:02:38	00:02:40	1	so i said to him 
00:02:40	00:02:47	2	i said uh people like you are what make america great the immigrants [noise] and uh 
00:02:47	00:02:48	1	interesting observation 
00:02:48	00:03:03	2	he said he said that in eighteen years of living here and no one ever said that to him oh that oh he'd heard was you guys come over here you take all our money he says he <unk> he says we take the money he says we taking the jobs where we're working piece of just like anyone else 
00:03:03	00:03:05	1	mhm 
00:03:12	00:03:13	2	so in any case 
00:03:13	00:03:16	1	screw that remark what happened is when i went over there 
00:03:16	00:03:26	2	[noise] he said he was very embarrassed he didn't have the title and what has happened is he's been running a collisions shop so about a month ago he had gone over to an hour 
00:03:26	00:03:27	1	and to buy a car for his wife 
00:03:27	00:03:30	2	and he had bought this <unk> 
00:03:30	00:03:32	1	and then uh it had 
00:03:32	00:03:39	2	ah mechanical problem he didn't even want to try to mess with it at one mechanic said it's the head gasket ones that is the former stat 
00:03:49	00:03:51	1	and uh it's just something 
00:03:51	00:03:52	2	doesn't want to work on the car 
00:04:14	00:04:17	1	he said that it could be as much as to more weeks before 
00:04:19	00:04:20	2	or it could arrive in the mail today 
00:04:20	00:04:22	1	yeah 
00:04:47	00:04:49	1	yeah and uh 
00:04:49	00:04:55	2	he seems to be a muslim though he's talking more like a hindu <unk> it's at all roads lead to the same god 
00:04:55	00:04:57	1	yeah oh 
00:04:57	00:04:58	2	<unk> 
00:04:59	00:05:04	2	so in any case it's it's uh turned out to be not just one but to answer 
00:05:04	00:05:05	1	uh-huh 
00:05:05	00:05:11	2	you know with a bit of a delay thrown in but right uh i'm not real anxious about that 
00:05:17	00:05:20	2	and oh now were you check out the assignments 
00:05:20	00:05:21	1	oh yeah 
00:05:21	00:05:26	2	mhm mhm so personally that to be 
00:05:26	00:05:37	1	all it needs well if it does need to head gasket it's um i i looked it up and above over and it looks like ball but was probably one of the easiest cars there is to change 
00:05:37	00:05:39	2	you know 'cause i bring my tours in one 
00:05:39	00:05:44	1	you yeah okay yeah but i'm going to have to get uh get one that's better caliber 
00:05:44	00:05:58	2	oh because i'm um it's it's just something where um they they make a kind where you said a dial in it clicks and so on um i have to do that because i've been <unk> 
00:05:58	00:06:02	1	maybe you can trade off war thing and uh 
00:06:02	00:06:16	2	trade the one i bought up uh in terms of bio one i don't know how you know i mean yeah i've never heard of trading tools but yeah well you know unless it was with a person but mhm 
00:06:16	00:06:18	1	but um [noise] 
00:06:23	00:06:24	1	but um 
00:06:24	00:06:28	2	um i'm going to have to have real <unk> on though 
00:06:28	00:06:29	1	right 
00:06:29	00:06:38	2	[noise] but the way i look at it is upon buying all four to five thousand dollar car for twenty five hundred and i have to go out and spend forty dollars on the rent so i'm not really going to worry about 
00:06:38	00:06:45	1	yeah no no [laughter] um 
00:06:45	00:06:52	2	now remember we had a couple of times we want well one time i think or maybe twice this lebanese restaurant 
00:06:52	00:06:54	1	mhm is there any connection there 
00:06:54	00:06:59	2	uh not really mhm 
00:06:59	00:07:02	1	i'm not sure which one we went to <unk> 
00:07:02	00:07:15	2	well we went to the same one yeah and all i can <unk> it was on a busy wide street mhm and of course there are a lot of busy wide streets and 
00:07:15	00:07:16	1	and there was one every mile 
00:07:16	00:07:19	2	yeah and um 
00:07:46	00:07:54	2	then it's all going to um work out for the good water which ever way it goes them mhm and um so 
00:07:54	00:07:56	2	well um 
00:07:56	00:07:59	1	i guess i've been reading a message 
00:08:01	00:08:03	1	yeah um 
00:08:03	00:08:06	2	i went through um 
00:08:06	00:08:08	1	matthew i'm marge zip zip 
00:08:08	00:08:27	2	and then some more about the middle of all of a sudden one evening i was reading it before i went to bed and uh now wait a minute it's slow down and um so i did and i've slowed down in john and um and and through 
00:08:27	00:08:28	1	[noise] um 
00:08:28	00:08:33	2	it helped a lot and i actually it cleared up i think a lot of the um 
00:08:33	00:08:35	1	uh-huh 
00:08:35	00:08:42	2	well i kind of uh several years i've had this feeling an accident was more travel logs and 
00:08:42	00:08:44	1	and or anything 
00:08:48	00:08:51	1	so i realized i because i have missed it 
00:08:55	00:08:56	1	yeah um 
00:08:56	00:09:14	2	so ah he has a way of presenting things where it's [noise] it does make it clear <unk> although i thought i had a pretty good handle on john eight but i got through a john eight and i know 
00:09:14	00:09:16	1	well what was he talking about 
00:09:16	00:09:23	2	so i thought i decided no oh go ahead and read the rest of the new testament and i'll go back and pick up john 
00:09:23	00:09:25	1	yeah 
00:09:45	00:09:48	1	no this is one of those um 
00:09:48	00:09:49	2	mhm 
00:09:49	00:09:53	1	yeah and they're kind of equal in a in a way it's an equal john seventeen 
00:09:53	00:09:55	2	mhm 
00:09:55	00:09:57	1	mm um maybe even surpass 
00:09:57	00:10:04	2	although i think those two chapters are have a different focus going different direction 
00:10:04	00:10:06	1	oh yeah they 
00:10:06	00:10:11	2	parallels you might say and um [noise] and um 
00:10:12	00:10:13	1	mhm 
00:10:13	00:10:24	2	but um uh uh i like what i what i read and romans it's um romans as rough to begin with it 
00:10:24	00:10:27	1	some of the <unk> over there to chew on yeah 
00:10:27	00:10:31	2	well his presentation that so um 
00:10:31	00:10:34	1	well it's a difference and chewing on roast 
00:10:34	00:10:35	2	beef 
00:10:35	00:10:36	1	and drawing on 
00:10:36	00:10:37	2	[laughter] 
00:10:37	00:10:38	1	oh what 
00:10:38	00:10:40	2	<unk> 
00:10:40	00:10:42	1	mhm 
00:10:42	00:10:48	2	bringing your legs out of us stringy strains out of a chicken like something or 
00:10:48	00:10:51	1	two and two and two and nothing happens 
00:10:51	00:11:00	2	well the king james is very very accurate yeah in a word for word sort of way but the syntax and something like romans five it's almost impossible 
00:11:00	00:11:02	1	mhm mhm 
00:11:02	00:11:21	2	and on it seems like a lot of the things that are right up the heart of the new problem if they <unk> and the king james <unk> with accuracy so i can say it like that mhm they they do do it word for word very well but um it it comes together and such a jumble but it's almost unreasonable 
00:11:21	00:11:23	1	mhm and uh 
00:11:23	00:11:32	2	so i don't really basically i don't worry because it's okay and it seems sort of cloudy to me today next week next month 
00:11:44	00:11:49	1	right the above and beneath business is the is the heart of it 
00:12:02	00:12:13	2	i believe in in doing that it gives us a real link between policy olive tree and once jesus preached about the kingdom of god because the <unk> of of having us from above 
00:12:15	00:12:16	1	mhm 
00:12:16	00:12:17	2	mhm 
00:12:18	00:12:19	1	oh mhm 
00:12:19	00:12:21	2	but i um 
00:12:21	00:12:24	1	oh i've caught on to one thing 
00:12:30	00:12:32	1	yeah 
00:12:32	00:12:39	2	supposed to [laughter] i've got the leaves for work now now that's the uh the only thing i 
00:12:39	00:12:40	1	um start breeding 
00:12:40	00:12:54	2	um read more than i um more than the time i thought okay i've got ten minutes um and i <unk> i've read for fifteen before i realized i've passed [laughter] 
00:12:54	00:12:55	1	yeah that's good 
00:12:55	00:12:57	2	mhm 
00:12:57	00:12:59	1	relative to do that [laughter] 
00:12:59	00:13:01	2	sure 
00:13:01	00:13:04	2	yeah that's true mhm 
00:13:04	00:13:04	1	mhm 
00:13:04	00:13:09	1	so [noise] i'm not sure 
00:13:09	00:13:12	2	uh is that oh variable 
00:13:12	00:13:13	1	um 
00:13:13	00:13:17	2	i i know you order that from this place and 
00:13:17	00:13:20	1	or massachusetts is they're available and bookstores 
00:13:20	00:13:31	2	as far as i know it is um christian book distributors just has good prices mhm and um they generally have everything marked down uh anywhere from a little bit too a lot 
00:13:31	00:13:33	1	yeah 
00:13:33	00:13:38	2	no they send me a catalogue and i have a lot of books i'd sure like the gap 
00:13:38	00:13:39	1	yeah 
00:13:39	00:13:41	2	no me price productions 
00:13:41	00:13:43	1	[laughter] 
00:13:43	00:13:45	2	yeah um my 
00:13:45	00:13:47	1	two or three pages huh 
00:13:47	00:13:51	2	i don't know it's funny the books i'm on are the ones that are marked on 
00:13:51	00:13:57	1	fifty to seventy seventy five percent yeah does that say something about a taste in books 
00:14:02	00:14:03	1	oh wow 
00:14:03	00:14:08	2	uh because a lot of times the newest books uh you know federal supply and demand thing 
00:14:08	00:14:13	1	mhm and it hasn't gotten to where there's any kind of a lot of supply yet 
00:14:22	00:14:29	2	mhm uh a few years ago you know would have sold for top dollar but now they've got it marked down quite a bit 
00:14:29	00:14:30	1	mhm 
00:14:30	00:14:32	2	and um 
00:14:43	00:14:45	1	one corner or something 
00:14:45	00:14:48	2	yeah you're right about that i hadn't thought about it pretty well 
00:14:48	00:14:51	1	the books they have marked way down are classics 
00:14:51	00:14:56	2	mhm mhm right right 
00:14:56	00:15:02	1	and they always have a a good price on things like <unk> some standard reference work 
00:15:02	00:15:12	2	yeah and uh so i still think one of the best buys out ever bonkers when i remember in atlanta uh there was um 
00:15:12	00:15:14	1	mhm 
00:15:14	00:15:21	2	uh just off of beautiful island and i bought strong complete can cartons for four dollars <unk> 
00:15:21	00:15:23	1	oh yeah yeah that's 
00:15:23	00:15:36	2	i think that's one of the best buy that book i've ever made mhm it's still um meet doesn't blurred still dusters i've used it a lot it's held up or one person i'm easy on books 
00:15:36	00:15:38	1	any one yeah 
00:15:38	00:15:45	2	uh so i figure that has to be one of the best buys i've ever made mhm and uh 
00:15:45	00:15:47	1	<unk> one of the grand world war 
00:15:47	00:15:49	2	of old age [laughter]

00:17:57	00:18:02	1	so he and dr ford we're going to go to bulgaria and then they were going to go on to a bible 
00:18:02	00:18:11	2	school in russia [noise] one of the pine crest graduate so it started and running and um well making a long story short

00:20:23	00:20:27	2	mhm but if the city officials ask for it 
00:20:27	00:20:29	1	and then of course you can do it 
00:20:29	00:20:34	2	so in other words they have a liberty to ask and then if they ask then you have the liberty to do it 
00:20:34	00:20:35	1	uh-huh 
00:20:35	00:20:50	2	so this pastor uh who's also an evangelist has gotten invitations from a number of villages but his biggest problem with money uh so again what ended up happening tom had some extra money to give to the bulgarian 
00:21:00	00:21:01	1	transportation 
00:21:01	00:21:11	2	for the people who participate in the cruise for the equipment so mhm <unk> system that kind of thing and like they have to higher taxes or something uh because of 
00:21:11	00:21:15	1	oh the equipment they have to carry over there musical instruments and that sort of thing 
00:21:15	00:21:28	2	[noise] so anyway it's about a hundred dollars apiece so time getting five hundred dollars and they are now going to be working like killing snakes in order to have five of these meetings before the elections in october 
00:21:28	00:21:29	1	mhm 
00:21:29	00:21:40	2	[noise] it's possible but if the elections bringing a new government but there'll be a complete chains of policy mhm and they may or may not be able to continue with these open air meetings 
00:21:40	00:21:40	1	yeah 
00:21:40	00:21:51	2	so in any case then um from that contact they went on to <unk> when they got to dough brits the pastor was still the pastor 
00:21:51	00:21:53	1	decided he would not take a salary any more 
00:21:53	00:21:58	2	and he started selling ice cream uh just as <unk> as a street vendor 
00:21:58	00:21:59	1	mhm 
00:22:04	00:22:06	1	oh because 
00:22:06	00:22:13	2	in communist countries they have usually fantastic what good um uh public transit system 
00:22:13	00:22:15	1	mhm and uh of course 
00:22:15	00:22:33	2	of the reason for that is that the economy doesn't support everyone having their own car oh so so they have these marvelous public transportation systems and the downtown in dover is is uh really if they did something like this here in the states that would have been over a great it's like a big open their mouth 
00:22:33	00:22:34	1	mhm 
00:22:34	00:22:50	2	and i bet it's half a mile long some places it's probably a quarter of a mile deep to several blocks deep um <unk> <unk> so of course the traffic can drive up to this thing and i think they're a couple of alleys were trucks and come back through 
00:22:50	00:22:50	1	mhm 
00:22:58	00:23:00	1	and uh 
00:23:00	00:23:10	2	so that's where i met coasts been selling is ice cream and an hour for the day probably most of the church will end up in that <unk> for one reason or another 
00:23:10	00:23:11	1	[laughter] 
00:23:11	00:23:22	2	being more of the people as nice clean and then he was a pastor [laughter] even probably make more money too and they don't even realize it you know what i mean it's it's a weird situation 
00:23:22	00:23:24	1	yeah it's an interesting turn of events 
00:23:24	00:23:31	2	then all the elders and the church had resigned not because they were disgruntled and wanted to leave 
00:23:35	00:23:37	1	in <unk> 
00:23:37	00:23:46	2	and they felt that it was just an active submissions turning their outlawed to resign and if god wanted them to continue that he would somehow speak 
00:23:46	00:23:47	1	mhm 
00:23:47	00:24:00	2	so what ended up happening is built pepper having an apple starlet ministry having started uh literally dozens of churches and having been sort of a um a fatherly figure with a number of other people 
00:24:00	00:24:01	1	who have started churches 
00:24:01	00:24:04	2	bill has a pretty strong idea of what works and what 
00:24:04	00:24:05	1	doesn't 
00:24:05	00:24:13	2	mhm and um so he didn't just try to dictate to them what they ought to do he just started asking questions 
00:24:13	00:24:14	1	uh-huh 
00:24:14	00:24:18	2	and by the time has a few days there were over um 
00:24:40	00:25:04	2	and um so it it was just a tremendous visitation of god for that particular church because we gave him a nuisance of direction on purpose and now i i guess the way bill handled it was that he didn't think of himself as being someone called interest to tell them what to do but it was more a matter of kind of awakening the talent we're already there and 
00:25:04	00:25:07	1	hello 
00:25:07	00:25:15	2	oh it was just a flip a time went with bell pepper they never expected to get there and find a church ready to reorganize 
00:25:15	00:25:18	1	uh but it it that's how the triplets 
00:25:18	00:25:26	2	mhm [laughter] sort of sort of like um x. all over the twentieth 
00:25:26	00:25:28	1	yeah mhm 
00:25:28	00:25:31	2	and uh things have happened here and there and 
00:25:31	00:25:38	1	and now when you go when you leave tomorrow for new york how long were you will be gone 
00:25:38	00:25:51	2	[noise] i'm going to be coming home sunday night oh i've got two men from the church going with me and one of them has to be back for work on monday mhm yeah you're going to pay for <unk> no we sold that one 
00:25:51	00:25:55	1	oh so we've got a um a green one 
00:25:55	00:25:57	2	mhm and um 
00:25:57	00:26:00	1	i kinda bought it the same way on buying the seven forty 
00:26:00	00:26:02	2	mhm um 
00:26:03	00:26:08	2	it's funny you know you you were mentioning on eight that from above them from <unk> 
00:26:08	00:26:11	1	it it seems to be really at the hardest things 
00:26:11	00:26:18	2	[noise] <unk> um you know i prayed for this this particular car that i'm buying and the thing that came to me was 
00:26:20	00:26:21	1	now 
00:26:21	00:26:30	2	the important thing is not just um what was said but the important thing is that there was some kind of an answer from above huh 
00:26:30	00:26:35	1	you know what i mean in other words you could you could make a duck from out of that but the ducks and we'll be from me 
00:26:35	00:26:36	2	uh-huh 
00:26:36	00:26:38	1	they'd just be man's thinking 
00:26:38	00:26:38	2	yeah 
00:26:38	00:26:43	1	but when god reveals that's from above mhm now 
00:27:05	00:27:09	2	oh he was kind of a macho type from kentucky 
00:27:09	00:27:10	1	and so he 
00:27:10	00:27:23	2	he felt you know she would say where have you been you said you'd be home at six here it is nine thirty his attitude would be i don't have to tell you where i've been oh yeah you know it was like <unk> and <unk> 
00:27:23	00:27:29	1	anybody knows he was under a car the whole time but it might have just the idea of telling his wife where he'd been bothered him 
00:27:29	00:27:33	2	middle real like less of a ma'am mhm so in any case um 
00:27:33	00:27:36	1	i prayed for a car a year ago 
00:27:36	00:27:40	2	and the thing that came to me was go to an auction with stress 
00:27:43	00:27:43	2	mhm 
00:27:43	00:27:47	1	yeah so definitely i went to an option i didn't find a car 
00:27:47	00:27:50	2	but what happened is i did spend three or four hours jeff 
00:28:03	00:28:06	1	about ten of 'em and hatred that he said 
00:28:06	00:28:22	2	he says god was really with you and he said after he says right after you left jesus i bought ten cars but of course i didn't find when i was looking for oh but in the process of looking for it he knew what i was looking for until about a month later he says i found a bowl of them 
00:28:37	00:28:41	1	[noise] it would have been a lot of work to restore it but i would have gotten a car 
00:28:41	00:28:57	2	i think sixty thousand miles on it mhm uh probably for two or three thousand mhm and uh i'd have ended up coming out probably three thousand dollars ahead but i'd have had more money than i wanted to spend right then 
00:28:57	00:28:58	1	oh i didn't have the time 
00:28:58	00:29:02	2	but right behind that was a green two forty 
00:29:02	00:29:04	1	uh-huh i said well what about that one that's uh 
00:29:04	00:29:12	2	their looks like what i can handle it was missing it's fate huh one of them was there but it wasn't the anchor down 
00:29:12	00:29:15	1	a window it'd been removed the radio was out 
00:29:15	00:29:17	2	um 
00:29:17	00:29:19	1	two pieces of prim scattered around on the <unk> 
00:29:19	00:29:29	2	mhm and um so anyway i bought that car and they they didn't have any kids for it so they dropped the asking price from fifteen hundred to thirteen fifty 
00:29:29	00:29:30	1	mhm 
00:29:30	00:29:36	2	well after i got home and realized i bought the car i thought you know i've never ever heard this thing one who knows i believe in 
00:29:36	00:29:37	1	[laughter] 
00:29:37	00:29:46	2	but the point is you know the the thing i'd gotten from above was go to an auction with jeff <unk> and 
00:29:46	00:29:50	1	i've done this i just followed the threat of events that occurred after going to the option with stress 
00:29:50	00:29:52	2	<unk> well maine 
00:29:52	00:29:56	1	things like that time spent with jeff was time well spent because 
00:29:56	00:29:57	2	um 
00:29:57	00:29:59	1	uh-huh 
00:29:59	00:30:00	2	began to work with
