00:16:47	00:16:49	1	<unk> but you know i think 
00:16:49	00:16:56	2	that's our tendency to totally go overboard with men and what's definitely her tendency i'll tell you that she goes way overboard my opinion

00:17:13	00:17:18	1	you'd rub off on me a little [laughter] oh but unfortunately i don't think that's gonna hey i'm 
00:17:18	00:17:24	2	he said to her listen to what he said to her but sad when when she said what's the deal you're say wait for you when you go 
00:17:24	00:17:32	1	these trips or what's the deal and he's like no that's unfair he goes you know the only thing different between a friend that's a girl and a girl friend is that you sleep with your girlfriend 
00:17:32	00:17:34	2	god 
00:17:34	00:17:42	1	if someone would say something i'd say excuse me then i'm not i'm just your <unk> girl i'm just i'm just a friend that's a girl

00:17:56	00:17:58	1	and <unk> 
00:17:58	00:18:16	2	good vocabulary syntax and all that kind of stuff because they also doing it for other other languages like native mandarin and eat chips in arabic and so forth so i put an announcement out for the students that if they're interested in going into reading of our call plus thirty or ten dollars they can do this 
00:18:16	00:18:19	1	that's great so how many times can you call me
