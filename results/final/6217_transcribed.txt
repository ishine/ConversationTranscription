00:04:48	00:04:49	2	uh-huh 
00:05:07	00:05:20	2	it's a huge garbage bags in most of it wasn't garbage bags mhm i just threw everything in the garbage bag and and put 'em on this big like rent a cart you know you get it off and on that i i had a wheel it all the way the state of which took so long up a hill it was so 
00:05:20	00:05:22	1	<unk> oh boy 
00:05:22	00:05:29	2	and so if i would have had to have my uh computers on the cart it will not have been good 'cause i could is like well it opens up and they could have gone 
00:05:29	00:05:33	1	could have fallen off definitely need to have computers bumped around 
00:05:33	00:05:37	2	so may basically uh drove me oh that's great yeah and she helped me carrying the men 
00:05:37	00:05:40	1	so how many drifted you have to make back and forth

00:06:09	00:06:10	1	well me we've got time 
00:06:10	00:06:21	2	oh good point okay [laughter] well it's like doesn't really care that much about other people it's like she seems to be nice but it's like she i don't it's really hard to describe 
00:06:22	00:06:27	2	she's kind of superficially nice but she's not really thoughtful and she didn't say oh it's 
00:06:27	00:06:32	1	meet at any way she's not it's just almost like she's nice and it's just so blood say about things she doesn't 
00:06:32	00:06:34	2	care at all mhm 
00:06:34	00:06:36	1	anything like about how people feel 
00:06:36	00:06:41	2	and oh for example this is one thing uh <unk> it's been really automated 
00:06:41	00:06:43	1	lately i don't know if i told you about this was that 
00:06:43	00:06:50	2	josh it basically it's like living in the room the only thing he doesn't do it here sleep and that doesn't matter 'cause when i'm sleeping i don't care if he's in there 
00:06:50	00:06:53	1	uh-huh you know what i mean uh-huh but uh 
00:06:53	00:06:54	2	doesn't sleep in your body <unk> 
00:06:54	00:06:58	1	this time of year mhm so you don't have any privacy 
00:06:58	00:07:02	2	i had to ask him a leaves i want to change mhm and or go somewhere else 
00:07:02	00:07:05	1	strange uh-huh we live it's pretty ridiculous yeah 
00:07:05	00:07:11	2	so the thing is um basically oh what a frustrating thing so 
00:07:11	00:07:12	1	josh 
00:07:12	00:07:14	2	like likes to play this game called <unk> 
00:07:14	00:07:15	1	<unk> mhm which is this 
00:07:15	00:07:22	2	stupid video game and it's on your computer and him in all the other guys on the <unk> on the floor like loves playing <unk> 
00:07:22	00:07:23	1	uh-huh so they all come in 
00:07:23	00:07:28	2	right and they all and they do at the stupidest thing they do it too 
00:07:28	00:07:31	1	that is really in consider actually that's 
00:07:31	00:07:36	2	just they've done it sometimes to twelve sometimes it's too one but it it's like a week and they they were doing it 
00:07:36	00:07:37	1	walk in the morning uh-huh 
00:07:37	00:07:39	2	next day 
00:07:41	00:07:57	2	you know that's really really in consider and i was i'll tell you the truth that's one of the reasons that i don't like coed dorms and it's not that i have anything against you know guys and girls being on the same floor but i think that it's so much more unruly 
00:07:57	00:07:59	1	and um 
00:07:59	00:08:08	2	all of these things that you're experiencing i just think i don't think it enhances the experience i think it really you know makes it more stressful well guess what tiresome experience 
00:08:08	00:08:10	1	i'm not going to <unk> 
00:08:10	00:08:20	2	i know and going to be single sex dorm i know in one way you know what did i mean did you have some pleasurable experience is that 
00:08:20	00:08:23	1	had a couple of some random pleasurable experience 
00:08:23	00:08:34	2	did you make some people some friends with people that you'd like to maintain yeah yeah like one girl i tried to get it get to join and say to her name's summer uh-huh 
00:08:34	00:08:38	1	yeah you did but yeah she's really sweet uh-huh 
00:08:38	00:08:43	2	[noise] i liked it a lot [noise] will be sure to keep in touch with her 
00:08:45	00:08:50	2	yeah i mean it's not like you're far you can come and visit it's five minutes walk oh not a big problem but as you can you 
00:08:50	00:08:52	1	you know you can ever come visit you 
00:08:52	00:09:08	2	so i really don't think i like any of the people here enough to really want to maintain a friendship with which is really it's really a shame it is considering i mean i made friends with joy so quickly and <unk> and i've been here a whole semester and there's no one i'm really close to mhm and i've tried mhm 
00:09:10	00:09:17	2	well you know sometimes you mix with a group and sometimes you just don't but i guess but you know 
00:09:17	00:09:22	1	<unk> i mean i've i've made more friends with people say to that <unk> well that's my point uh obviously 
00:09:22	00:09:31	2	you know you and say to chose each other because you have a lot in common yeah and you know that's what's so nice about it as you feel kind of <unk> go with them 
00:09:36	00:09:43	2	i really liked them mhm i mean not all of them are friendly but it's you know it's a huge house oh of course so yeah it's really cool 
00:09:43	00:09:47	1	so i think that um aren't you glad that you made the decision to change 
00:09:47	00:09:53	2	i really am i really especially for the last several weeks have been really miserable mhm really 
00:09:53	00:09:57	1	well i'm sorry you've been so miserable but boy it sure reinforces your decision 
00:09:57	00:10:02	2	yeah seriously mhm so i'm really glad you guys convinced me move 
00:10:02	00:10:07	1	so how has near uh been to toward you well surprised she hasn't 
00:10:07	00:10:15	2	she really does not care when i told her she just didn't say anything so weird she's like she just doesn't care about anything 
00:10:15	00:10:18	1	uh-huh but not in a depressed way uh-huh 
00:10:18	00:10:29	2	totally i'm i just really couldn't care but i'm thrilled with whatever's happening whatever i don't feel like she's happy i'm leaving or anything she doesn't care was she happy for you i mean did she say i'm happy for you 
00:10:29	00:10:35	1	yes but i mean basically the thing is it's like she doesn't get mad and she doesn't get she doesn't get <unk> 
00:10:35	00:10:44	2	uh-huh so she's just so neutral yeah mhm she doesn't get <unk> i've never seen her agree mhm ever literally she doesn't she doesn't she doesn't 
00:10:44	00:10:50	1	cry uh-huh yeah uh-huh literally so she's just really in the middle all the time yeah 
00:10:50	00:10:58	2	it's really strange well it's kind of frustrating because then you don't really get to feel like there are a real person 
00:10:58	00:11:01	1	i really i don't know she's just 
00:11:01	00:11:08	2	[noise] it's like we've lived together for an entire semester and i feel like i know her a little bit but generally let me know her 
00:11:08	00:11:10	1	uh-huh it's like she just 
00:11:10	00:11:12	2	care that much she doesn't really 
00:11:12	00:11:14	1	have any really close girlfriends 
00:11:14	00:11:15	2	it's here uh-huh 
00:11:15	00:11:20	1	and i guess i don't either but uh closer wasn't she does like all she hangs out with his josh and the guy 
00:11:20	00:11:38	2	before and then lately a gourmet mall but you know uh-huh well you know you so you can't pick your roommates so yeah the best you could but i'm leaving though what i'm glad i'm leaving oh i know well just think about how happy <unk> be coming back 
00:11:38	00:11:45	2	you'll be really pleased in thrilled you're right about that how many girls are moving in second semester 
00:11:45	00:11:51	1	i said before about seven eight so 
00:12:08	00:12:10	1	mhm so 
00:12:10	00:12:10	2	mhm 
00:12:10	00:12:13	1	so um what'd you do with all your stuff 
00:12:13	00:12:16	2	there's a storage room and theater and i just basically 
00:12:20	00:12:24	2	so they lock it yeah it's all safe and and in fact she was really protective 
00:12:24	00:12:26	1	she wouldn't even let me leave it open for like five minutes 
00:12:26	00:12:32	2	oh really yeah oh that's really nice yeah so she's real careful yeah is this an older woman 
00:12:32	00:12:35	1	she's very old she's sort of a little 
00:12:35	00:12:38	2	yeah yeah what's her name is <unk> uh-huh 
00:12:38	00:12:41	1	she's okay she's temporary sort of 
00:12:41	00:12:45	2	what other house lady was like psychotic oh no yeah 
00:12:45	00:12:46	1	oh really 
00:12:46	00:12:57	2	well i guess we have to wonder who's going to be a house mother yeah you know somebody who is real busy or has a a life isn't really going to want to know that too 
00:12:57	00:13:00	1	a widower you know someone someone who doesn't have much 
00:13:00	00:13:02	2	if you see an ex 
00:13:02	00:13:09	1	i don't think so it's not a requirement mhm it'd be nice but is requirement usually there um 
00:13:32	00:13:42	1	like it was this magic quite that much but that's okay i don't hate or either mhm [noise] well i don't remember anybody necessarily going and you know talking to her for advice and stuff like that 
00:13:42	00:13:51	2	oh you know god would go to her for advice you thought that type of person uh-huh and i don't think we're quite that desperate [laughter] 
00:13:51	00:13:53	1	but it's good to have an adult they're just in case 
00:13:53	00:13:55	2	yeah 
00:13:55	00:14:00	1	so anyway how's debit lately um he's been really busy 
00:14:00	00:14:04	2	telling me that he's been like really sort of nasty to her well yeah she 
00:14:04	00:14:13	1	has not had a good experience within the last thing going on [noise] um well you know how when you're an adolescent how you're really into yourself 
00:14:13	00:14:16	2	well what do you consider me i'd listen 
00:14:16	00:14:18	1	no but when you were in high school 
00:14:18	00:14:19	2	more that way you don't get to the 
00:14:19	00:14:22	1	not really real i mean you're kind of like 
00:14:22	00:14:26	2	how old teenager now 
00:14:26	00:14:29	1	oh [laughter] 
00:14:29	00:14:40	2	[laughter] i'm like i mean you still are in adolescents but okay but you know you're not like in the middle of adolescence anymore once you get out of high school and and um you've had all these maturing experiences 
00:14:40	00:14:42	1	had sex and stuff like that 
00:14:42	00:14:47	2	i beg your pardon groups i didn't see that it's where i'm just kidding who did the dirty deed 
00:14:47	00:14:49	1	[laughter] 
00:14:49	00:14:58	2	i just thinking that this is being recorded grades they should have regretted that conversation we are the other day which one which one 
00:15:01	00:15:05	1	[laughter] is that guy ever going to speak to you again 
00:15:05	00:15:26	2	i don't think he cared distracted okay but [laughter] <unk> what this is like totally off the subject what describe what borderline personality is why 'cause i'm curious what else well uh taking psych remember mhm it's really kind of complicated um well i my challenging or mental abilities or something no 
00:15:26	00:15:28	1	yeah sure 
00:15:41	00:15:44	2	um i'm sure that i have 
00:15:44	00:15:45	1	okay sure they have 
00:15:45	00:15:53	2	um but i didn't really understand borderline personality until more recently really learn about that in social work no mhm 
00:15:53	00:15:54	1	okay 
00:15:54	00:15:56	2	um how do you 
00:15:56	00:15:57	1	that if you don't understand it 
00:15:57	00:16:02	2	well i've got a good diagnostic me i know and i read books on it really mhm 
00:16:02	00:16:04	1	cool so tell me about it 
00:16:04	00:16:06	2	okay um a borderline 
00:16:06	00:16:07	1	you don't want to 
00:16:07	00:16:14	2	you know i don't know i can tell you just a little bit i just interested okay a borderline personality is um 
00:16:14	00:16:15	1	mhm 
00:16:37	00:16:39	1	all those reality is more fragile 
00:16:39	00:17:02	2	[noise] and um i'm just trying to think of of um what i can describe i don't i don't really know what that well to be able to say that much about it but um they're actually it's it's not an easy they've known allergy disorder to treat 
00:17:02	00:17:06	1	or to diagnose [noise] no i don't think it's no i mean when you look at the diagnosed 
00:17:06	00:17:23	2	um description is probably not that hard to diagnose um but i've known people who were borderline personality that you know when you first know them i mean they can appear to be completely normal but went after you've known them for a period of time right 
00:17:23	00:17:24	1	and you look back 
00:17:34	00:17:39	2	[noise] well um 
00:17:40	00:17:54	2	shirley right i've known julie dolphins and uh that's well okay oh three people now three people okay smith and corey really mhm are you sure absolutely 
00:17:54	00:18:00	1	wow i mean like that's sort of a little ironic that both of our old like people in our lives are mhm 
00:18:00	00:18:15	2	[noise] yeah well and and they're very different people but you can see how [noise] you know they appear tiered they appear to be really normal you know what i'm saying right you wouldn't really know but um when you look back i mean 
00:18:15	00:18:20	1	more evident with um cory um in terms of 
00:18:20	00:18:22	2	i mean this is isn't something that 
00:18:22	00:18:23	1	obscene 
00:18:23	00:18:28	2	but i i don't i mean i don't remember either really no i know it was sort of 
00:18:28	00:18:31	1	<unk> yeah but she she had i she actually 
00:18:31	00:18:43	2	had um i think semi psychotic episodes <unk> which one cory okay um and smith um distorted reality so much 
00:18:43	00:18:44	1	oh yeah that's for sure 
00:18:44	00:18:53	2	that i'm sure that you know in ways that you and i could look and know that it was a complete and total distortion 
00:18:53	00:18:57	1	[noise] but see you don't ever looked crazy to me what i was talking with 
00:18:57	00:19:03	2	i know i know that's the point she doesn't look crazy at all and and and borderline isn't crazy 
00:19:03	00:19:14	1	well let's see when i'm julie <unk> and dad said that she's borderline i know he doesn't like no or but it's like she's different though it's like she doesn't react like that she's more obviously 
00:19:14	00:19:28	2	well also you know i don't remember enough about her tell me tell you okay it's not a subject you want to talk about no that's okay okay just making sure isn't he'd rather talk about [noise] no i don't care what we talk about is fine 
00:19:28	00:19:33	1	okay uh basically uh 
00:19:33	00:19:41	2	[noise] awesome and just is like has problems with reality but in a different way it's like <unk> it's like uh hyper naive 
00:19:41	00:19:45	1	mhm <unk> mhm it's like she's extremely naive mhm 
00:19:58	00:20:03	2	again okay shrimp time mhm uh let's see 
00:20:03	00:20:05	1	well like when <unk> when didn't know what 
00:20:05	00:20:08	2	it was mhm i just thought it was bizarre 
00:20:08	00:20:10	1	mhm really bizarre she's from this country sheets 
00:20:10	00:20:11	2	the american mhm 
00:20:11	00:20:13	1	she's from another country and another call 
00:20:13	00:20:14	2	sure mhm she did 
00:20:14	00:20:16	1	no it wasn't even sure 
00:20:16	00:20:18	2	mhm she didn't know 
00:20:18	00:20:19	1	pretty weird 
00:20:58	00:21:04	2	i think um just her she was the one who didn't know about jumper cables and batter 
00:21:04	00:21:06	1	yeah uh-huh uh-huh 
00:21:06	00:21:08	2	[noise] i mean there's there's so much that 
00:21:08	00:21:13	1	as a as a normal person she should've been um <unk> 
00:21:13	00:21:27	2	too right you know more than that though sometimes she just gets really and it's intense look on her face and like but it's like blank [laughter] it's just really weird mhm and i think there's something wrong with her i just don't know if it's borderline or not 
00:21:27	00:21:32	1	well it could be i <unk> you know dad had um 
00:21:32	00:21:40	2	maybe more of a grip on on what it is than i do but um you know there's 
00:21:40	00:21:40	1	mhm 
00:21:40	00:21:48	2	things that you and i would would process in one way someone with a borderline personality would process it in a completely 
00:21:48	00:21:50	1	a different way 
00:21:50	00:21:51	2	right that would 
00:21:51	00:21:54	1	to the average person seem really abnormal that's that's 
00:21:54	00:22:02	2	<unk> mhm it's like sometimes she takes things and changes them and makes them appear different than they are mhm maybe that's it well <unk> 
00:22:02	00:22:03	1	process them differently 
00:22:03	00:22:04	2	uh-huh 
00:22:04	00:22:11	1	so you know and it's real it's hard to be in a relationship with um a borderline personality 
00:22:11	00:22:17	2	yeah no kidding mhm anyway [noise] actually i have sort of another topic to discuss within um 
00:22:17	00:22:20	1	number one <unk> 
00:22:20	00:22:31	2	maybe why 'cause you censor down i know that yeah it wasn't a good day really <unk> what happened well i'll tell you but um actually it's been it's been fine for the last couple of weeks 
00:22:31	00:22:33	1	oh in the room 
00:22:35	00:22:37	1	<unk> the preferences 
00:22:50	00:22:52	1	um he had these two 
00:22:52	00:22:57	2	do people come over who are um going to the who is going to hire right 
00:22:57	00:22:59	1	and yesterday i had 
00:22:59	00:23:05	2	painstakingly prepared their employment agreements they're right actually three employment agreements too as a three came today 
00:23:05	00:23:12	1	and i had you know put them together to copies and i'd clip them together and i had labeled each one of them and 
00:23:12	00:23:15	2	the little yellow sticky thing right 
00:23:15	00:23:19	1	and given 'em to death and and um today when they came 
00:23:19	00:23:23	2	um and dad came upstairs i was on the telephone or whatever i was 
00:23:23	00:23:24	1	at the computer 
00:23:24	00:23:28	2	and he went to look for the employment agreements and he could only find 
00:23:28	00:23:29	1	two of the three 
00:23:29	00:23:40	2	and so one of the people who was here he couldn't find <unk> and so he was understandably you know irritated and and irritable and and uh because he's 
00:23:40	00:23:41	1	too 
00:23:41	00:23:47	2	assuming that i don't put things away properly right you know that kind of thing so he snapped me 
00:23:50	00:23:54	2	i knew that i had given him all three i mean i knew i could get 
00:23:54	00:23:58	1	um all three and right because i had like i said very painstakingly prepare them 
00:23:58	00:24:00	2	and um 
00:24:00	00:24:00	1	mhm 
00:24:00	00:24:02	2	snap back at him and 
00:24:02	00:24:03	1	was 
00:24:03	00:24:14	2	probably defensive and he was really mad um that i responded that way and um felt i was completely inappropriate 
00:24:35	00:24:36	1	i 
00:24:36	00:24:41	2	you know kind of snap back and um i think he was 
00:24:51	00:24:53	1	um 
00:24:53	00:24:59	2	and he just felt that you know if if if this were a business situation and i were his secretary 
00:24:59	00:25:02	1	that i never would have spoken to him like that 
00:25:02	00:25:03	2	for other you're not a secretary 
00:25:03	00:25:10	1	no i'm not his secretary but you know then so he just really was kinda on the warpath with me all day 
00:25:10	00:25:15	2	refined did well he just printed out a new one on the computer and you know i don't know if you have 
00:25:15	00:25:17	1	if he did he probably wouldn't 
00:25:23	00:25:24	1	to me 
00:25:24	00:25:36	2	it was not a big thing i mean it was it it is true that you know i mean he shouldn't have snapped at me and i shouldn't have snap at him um but i just couldn't believe you know how sometimes 
00:25:36	00:25:41	1	you get really mad about small things yeah i mean like a really small 
00:25:41	00:25:53	2	but no but i mean it's it's true that i mean the you know it could just generated and two minutes on the computer again so it's not like it was oh boy yeah yeah you're right 
00:25:53	00:25:59	1	um [noise] anyway but i don't know why he was so upset about it all day but i think that 
00:25:59	00:26:04	2	he was stressed about some other things in relation to the business and i think 
00:26:04	00:26:06	1	going badly 
00:26:06	00:26:18	2	no no it's just that um some of the numbers that one person initially said came back ah he he came back and said different numbers today and that really uh you know um 
00:26:18	00:26:26	1	other words they went down yeah just in terms of numbers of sales i mean it's just in terms of production that's not in terms of actual my boss 
00:26:26	00:26:27	2	of course yeah no not yet 
00:26:27	00:26:29	1	anyway um 
00:26:29	00:26:30	2	pissed them off 
00:26:30	00:26:33	1	well it made him <unk> and and 
00:26:33	00:26:40	2	probably concern and i you know it's my feeling that when he gets um stressed about other things that um 
00:26:40	00:26:42	1	he makes everything else 
00:26:42	00:26:51	2	[noise] oh he you react stronger to little things that happen right and um so anyway that's what i think happened 
00:26:51	00:26:57	1	and so yeah i you know and then when i came home he was scouting out me oh god and 
00:26:57	00:27:05	2	i thought it was like all over and i was surprised that he was still scaling well couldn't it maybe it was something else so maybe it was 
00:27:05	00:27:08	1	so i said well what's the matter and 
00:27:08	00:27:18	2	and so 'cause i thought maybe it must've been something new you know [laughter] like oh now what'd i do yeah and ah so you know you just gave me this real scales you don't 
00:27:18	00:27:20	1	no oh god 
00:27:20	00:27:21	2	anyway 
00:27:25	00:27:40	2	yeah that's the problem with him being in business small it's completely insecure and what are you in psychology mhm everything was always i mean up until that lovely <unk> everything was completely normal and we'll stay in this business is gonna be blockbuster dynamite 
00:27:40	00:27:45	1	mom i that's that's the problem i don't know if it's gonna be blockbuster 
00:27:45	00:27:58	2	i think i think that more than anything he's ever done before the consensus is among the the various people that are working with it that this is uh you know a win win win situation 
00:27:58	00:28:01	1	you know what i mean i don't i don't sound that for me to have doubt 
00:28:01	00:28:02	2	it's like oh 
00:28:02	00:28:05	1	there's other business ideas who've been the same thing 
00:28:05	00:28:12	2	supposedly oh it's incredible wow this is definitely to work like like uh auto backs and 
00:28:12	00:28:18	1	the ah l. o. c. thing mhm you know limited liability company that was going to be a huge business 
00:28:18	00:28:27	2	well here the truth of the matter is you know he and i know how we really felt about the possibility of the other various businesses working you just 
00:28:27	00:28:29	1	feel that well 
00:28:29	00:28:44	2	well let me put it this way we felt far less certain even though you know anytime you go into a business do you think it's going to work because you wouldn't risk it if you didn't have the belief that it was going to work course but you know like for instance 
00:28:44	00:28:45	1	i don't know 
00:28:45	00:28:48	2	probably felt was um 
00:28:48	00:28:49	1	i'm sure it was going to work at all 
00:28:49	00:28:51	2	eighty twenty you know well 
00:28:51	00:28:57	1	the thing is that is almost even more certain because at that point you actually had an office you had to work and credit cards you had 
00:28:57	00:29:04	2	well i was out in that we had fun we had you know <unk> investors and funding from the bank you know in terms that was more 
00:29:04	00:29:07	1	twenty well that was almost ninety ten 
00:29:07	00:29:21	2	well not really because you still have to make the business work well right um but anyway i think that this is you know as much if not more likelihood where's the l. c. thing never was that strong and even the very 
00:29:21	00:29:22	1	so excited about that 
00:29:22	00:29:28	2	oh well of course you're if you're starting something new well yeah but we never had the same 
00:29:28	00:29:29	1	level of 
00:29:29	00:29:33	2	confirmation from other sources or belief 
00:29:33	00:29:34	1	you know that that that one 
00:29:34	00:29:42	2	very top would work i i felt a lot less you're about the very top because um the sail was had to be such a huge 
00:29:42	00:29:44	1	sale you know between 
00:29:44	00:29:47	2	four hundred thousand and a million dollars per se all that he's oh 
00:29:47	00:29:50	1	those huge figure well it was two completely unrealistic to me 
00:29:50	00:29:55	2	see that's what i think i think it was overpriced and um i didn't you know i mean 
00:29:55	00:29:59	1	it's like hard for me to get in <unk> she throws round because it's like he always
