00:05:39	00:05:42	1	some yeah different programs but uh 
00:05:42	00:05:50	2	i'm trying to think what else is god um upstairs christian michele uh uh um 
00:06:12	00:06:14	1	four weeks ago 
00:06:14	00:06:22	2	so it's pretty much a subtle but he was uh at the <unk> yeah they had um they had uh a detective who um 
00:06:35	00:06:37	1	no no [laughter] 
00:06:37	00:06:39	2	[laughter] 
00:06:39	00:06:43	1	things are always work this way [laughter] don't worry i'm not worried yeah 
00:06:48	00:06:49	1	next to last 
00:06:49	00:06:56	2	[laughter] right i hit it was just one of those things yeah but um so that that has to go the other 
00:06:56	00:07:00	1	yeah well that each kid has to go through this i guess i don't know 
00:07:00	00:07:01	2	there's always something new 
00:07:01	00:07:05	1	yeah so yeah that was interesting but um 
00:07:05	00:07:06	2	mm so 
00:07:06	00:07:12	1	well i mean i guess that would be the kind of like the uh the major news on

00:08:22	00:08:25	1	oh that that'll be nice after thirty years at school 
00:08:25	00:08:31	2	yeah really so that aspect will be done and um so yeah 
00:09:02	00:09:04	1	yeah yeah you know 
00:09:04	00:09:05	2	the whole phenomena 
00:09:05	00:09:07	1	yeah 
00:09:07	00:09:17	2	and made it sound that they will he wasn't being getting much attention and the reporters weren't ready and they weren't they weren't he wasn't giving getting 
00:09:17	00:09:18	1	a good coverage in the united states 
00:09:18	00:09:30	2	well i know before well they may be true true ah i mean to some extent i i haven't like it's not like i have a yeah i don't watch t._v. so i don't know what's on t._v. but um the um 
00:09:30	00:09:34	1	the news uh-huh wind up see before they had very 
00:09:34	00:09:50	2	<unk> who are critics of them yeah who were um you know saying that you know he's just he's not in touch and all that stuff and there's there was that aspect but once he was here with the amazing thing you know because it doesn't make any difference what's the process because once he has those huge 
00:09:50	00:09:51	1	crowds 
00:09:51	00:10:03	2	and that there are still like <unk> mind boggled that you know he gets these huge crowd and and his um ability to have like instant conversions i mean i've i've known tons of people and they're just they're they've had dancing conversion 
00:10:03	00:10:04	1	that's good 
00:10:04	00:10:09	2	so i mean it <unk> i mean granted he depressed doesn't necessarily help but there's something about him where he is 
00:10:09	00:10:12	1	he doesn't need the <unk> yeah yeah 
00:10:12	00:10:20	2	i mean 'cause he's able to get the um [noise] you know so that yeah i mean and and uh i guess it's you just become so 
00:10:31	00:10:33	1	just make 'em around them to it right 
00:10:33	00:10:40	2	but uh i know but just yeah it's amazing how um you know it's you know people 
00:10:40	00:10:41	1	[laughter] [laughter] 
00:10:41	00:10:52	2	incredible effect i mean i don't know i don't know what it is but um [noise] so yeah that's yeah i i mean if i <unk> i've been following it pretty close to the papers and stuff but um 
00:10:56	00:10:58	2	cause he's only stand five days 
00:10:58	00:11:01	1	at least today tonight so 
00:11:01	00:11:06	2	yeah so how is julius stay back in and like i 
00:11:06	00:11:12	1	haven't even seen her since she got back i i only one of the sisters came down to sicily so they sent me the letter 
00:11:12	00:11:18	2	uh i was just running our family was yeah i have no idea [laughter] that's what i had to go to italy to find out 
00:11:18	00:11:19	1	right 
00:11:26	00:11:28	1	yeah 'cause i yeah i had written 
00:11:28	00:11:34	2	because he wants to see about me margaret thinking about going to some type of occasional school but um 
00:12:03	00:12:18	2	oh i see oh that's nice yeah and um so i it was on both sides neither here nor there but um [noise] which i think what else i i you just for the moment called i had no it just like well this is what time is right now 
00:12:18	00:12:21	1	okay it's um 
00:12:28	00:12:30	1	i know that's coming up pretty soon 
00:12:30	00:12:32	2	uh yeah we do it before you guys do

00:12:43	00:12:45	1	what what you don't want to uh 
00:12:45	00:12:55	2	um how is this what the solution followed you know is that's is that anything is that just more or less what it is it's pretty much anything that's going to happen or not going to happen is pretty much done right 
00:12:55	00:12:57	1	uh i think so 
00:12:57	00:13:00	2	yeah yeah how's the mail order 
00:13:00	00:13:04	1	i think they're doing pretty good 'cause i don't have too much contact with them

00:16:00	00:16:01	1	aspect but 
00:16:02	00:16:05	1	<unk> like some of the sisters have gone to 
00:16:05	00:16:15	2	summer camps done but they they did one this summer [noise] done by done in um close to chicago and married

00:16:36	00:16:48	2	yeah for for u._s. towards two thousand right i think it was from what i don't know <unk> would run by a <unk> i think <unk> i don't remember very well anymore right 
00:16:48	00:16:50	1	mhm 
00:16:58	00:17:03	1	working in in uh in uh perish perish work okay <unk> 
00:17:03	00:17:07	2	and i'm sometimes get it and getting into this mentality is uh 
00:17:07	00:17:08	1	difficult because 
00:17:08	00:17:10	2	and 
00:17:10	00:17:17	1	they they want they they give you all their their heart you know they give you all the affection and then 
00:17:17	00:17:19	2	you like a family member right 
00:17:28	00:17:29	1	because 
00:17:29	00:17:35	2	lots of times they pretend that you do much for them but then they 
00:17:35	00:17:36	1	this is where that this 
00:17:36	00:17:44	2	i can understand the mafia here because then you so you think that they're being very hundred percent truthful and sincere 
00:17:44	00:17:46	1	but they're they're very <unk> 
00:17:46	00:17:50	2	um be interfere with you and then going around 
00:17:50	00:17:52	1	and and talking behind your back 
00:17:52	00:17:55	2	yeah so it's you have to be their cats 
00:17:55	00:17:58	1	you're given them um 
00:17:58	00:18:05	2	them being open with you and and and me being open with them because if i'm too open with them and i'm too opened and um 
00:18:05	00:18:18	1	it gets in rhonda because then they they know too much or they think they know too much and they and you don't have that trust they don't give you that trust anymore or they do to faces 
00:18:18	00:18:21	2	family already breeds contempt i mean <unk> 
00:18:21	00:18:23	1	yeah and they're also very you have to be there 
00:18:23	00:18:31	2	because sometimes they get offended very easily and so you have to know how to um sure treat 'em but then what they 
00:18:31	00:18:32	1	they expect 
00:18:32	00:18:37	2	from uh <unk> is that they'd be a priest or not they don't want them you know they <unk> 
00:18:37	00:18:39	1	big big respect 
00:18:39	00:18:40	2	food for religious 
00:18:40	00:18:43	1	right and like if you you know they'll ask you 
00:18:43	00:18:46	2	advice for everything even for his 
00:18:46	00:18:48	1	but things you know they'll ask you 
00:18:48	00:18:55	2	and and if you say no you have to go to a church walking backwards you know they believe you and they walk to church backwards 
00:18:55	00:18:57	1	saying oh yeah 
00:18:57	00:18:59	2	what what the sister says 
00:18:59	00:19:00	1	it's true is 
00:19:22	00:19:23	1	yeah but they take it 
00:19:23	00:19:30	2	seriously and so you know you gotta [noise] power other callers right [laughter] 
00:19:31	00:19:32	2	i <unk> yeah

00:21:41	00:21:57	2	some of the of the choir and which is good because there she has to be quiet for the littler kids and the ones for the bigger kids 'cause she has <unk> contact and um with a with a <unk> contact with them but she doesn't just leave it to the choir 
00:21:57	00:22:00	1	<unk> they do other things and then they come to her and they 
00:22:00	00:22:11	2	and um she she helps them out and everything she <unk> she kinda fall it has that personal touch touch which keeps it keeps her busy
