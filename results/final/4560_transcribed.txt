00:00:00	00:00:05	1	was the last the uh remodeling or uh home project that you've worked on 
00:00:05	00:00:19	2	well let's see um [noise] the last thing i worked on well let's see uh i haven't done an awful lot because i just bought my house here now um i've been planning on doing some work 
00:00:19	00:00:22	1	uh to uh fix up 
00:00:22	00:00:24	2	some of the stuff around here 
00:00:24	00:00:25	1	and uh 
00:00:25	00:00:35	2	been repairing some lights uh stuff like that uh need to i need to seal the er back deck since it's a <unk> they did a lot of the ghetto 
00:00:35	00:00:38	1	yeah that sounds like a good job 
00:00:38	00:00:46	2	yeah it's it's uh it it'll take a little while but once it gets a little bit warmer i'll probably be going into it 
00:00:46	00:00:49	1	yeah it might even be enjoyable and the weather gets nice mhm 
00:00:49	00:00:56	2	yeah the uh uh the house was kept in reasonably good prepared by the people who who i bought it 
00:00:56	00:00:57	1	from well that's good 
00:00:57	00:01:14	2	and uh but there's a there's a a number of things to do i also need to do some uh work with the uh uh heating and cooling system mm it doesn't get very good airflow to the upstairs ah they didn't design it very well so i have to put in some fans 
00:01:14	00:01:15	1	is it an old house 
00:01:15	00:01:24	2	no actually it's <unk> it's fairly new out uh it's just that they didn't <unk> there there isn't any airflow to the upstairs duct worked as a 
00:01:24	00:01:25	1	i see also 
00:01:25	00:01:36	2	and because of that they upped the uh <unk> two something into very very high which makes it noisy downstairs and wears out the bearings i just had to replace the bearings 
00:01:40	00:01:53	2	oh i have an old house and i just put it on i didn't do it myself i had a new furnace put in just a couple of months ago and what what they had here was an old gravity furnace was converted into a force there yeah <unk> 
00:01:53	00:01:55	1	i had one of those my previous house 
00:01:55	00:02:08	2	it it just didn't keep the house from where i'm at all and the fan hardly blue any or through the house so like you i have uh uh uh stepped up fan motor now and it's just incredible the difference it makes with the new furniture 
00:02:08	00:02:13	1	you know festive running uh you mean an r._p._m. mhm i have no idea 
00:02:13	00:02:30	2	tell you the truth there's four or five <unk> actually we had to turn it down to one of the lower <unk> because ah the higher sending didn't keep uh didn't let the furnace get hot enough to work efficiently right on the air was and all that hot right it's on one of the lower settings which is still quite a bit more than 
00:02:30	00:02:34	1	what we have yeah or yeah mine was turned up too 
00:02:34	00:02:45	2	uh fifteen hundred r._p._m. normal is more like you know seven or eight hundred right uh so it gets a lot of airflow downstairs yeah but uh still almost nothing upstairs 
00:02:45	00:02:47	1	it's not that bad 
00:02:53	00:02:58	2	yeah it won't be very very effective right right so i have it then 
00:02:58	00:03:04	1	yeah i have to figure out either some way to improve the duct taping or put a a booster fan going to the upstairs 
00:03:04	00:03:06	2	mhm um 
00:03:06	00:03:07	1	the <unk> on 
00:03:07	00:03:10	2	oh they had worn out to the point where 
00:03:10	00:03:14	1	it was rattling around uh rather badly 
00:03:19	00:03:21	1	wakes you up in the middle of the night that sort of thing huh 
00:03:21	00:03:30	2	well it's not that bad 'cause i can't hear it upstairs to the uh it gets it gets to a point where you can't hear the the television or 
00:03:30	00:03:31	1	[laughter] yeah uh-huh 
00:03:31	00:03:38	2	was getting to that point not very peaceful no it it does the the er furnace does have enough uh 
00:03:38	00:03:41	1	uh heating and cooling power 
00:03:46	00:03:53	1	check that out and it was <unk> cooling the air adequately uh-huh it was just all the cooling was going down state 
00:03:53	00:03:55	2	you know where you don't need it 
00:03:55	00:04:00	1	[laughter] yeah well the um i just repair to light 
00:04:00	00:04:02	2	last weekend also uh-huh 
00:04:02	00:04:03	1	you know it it has 
00:04:03	00:04:14	2	some hanging glass thing pains around it with a metal fringe in the middle <unk> it was like had ah been through away from the from the glass 
00:04:16	00:04:20	2	okay so it's a lot better now [laughter] oh that's good 
00:04:20	00:04:31	1	well the last major thing we did ourselves was we decided to refinish our bedroom redo the veteran the downstairs has all natural would trim mhm but the upstairs alta woodworkers paint and we 
00:04:31	00:04:40	2	we didn't like that so we thought we'd get ambitious and strip all the paying off of the woodwork and had i known what i was getting myself i don't think i would have chosen to 
00:04:40	00:04:41	1	[noise] yeah but 
00:04:41	00:04:46	2	started it so we finished and we also had it terrible this old wallpaper off the walls 
00:04:46	00:04:48	1	mhm and that was 
00:04:48	00:04:50	2	mess but yeah 
00:04:50	00:04:57	1	it's nice but we're a little disappointing because after getting all the would off um the paid off the would upstairs we realized that it wasn't the same quality
