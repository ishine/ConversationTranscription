00:03:13	00:03:14	1	and news 
00:03:14	00:03:27	2	want to do so i got it uh apply got accepted into graduate school at vermont who specializes in kicking you out into a one year master's program to do that so this starts in late august and i'm on the way up there kinda meandering up to the states and 
00:03:27	00:03:29	1	seeing anybody and everybody 
00:03:29	00:03:37	2	so if you're dead all behind was in the states i could make a point to go by and finds you but since you're doing the land of large explosions i haven't 
00:03:37	00:03:38	1	yeah 
00:03:38	00:03:40	2	well you're tours what three years 
00:03:40	00:03:44	1	no it's only two i've only got about six months left over 
00:03:44	00:03:46	2	winding up you know where you're going 
00:03:46	00:03:49	1	yeah twenty nine stumps [noise] you're kidding me no 
00:03:49	00:03:54	2	good deal i think i know some folks out there yeah well you know i i called the detail 
00:03:54	00:03:56	1	and i had originally um

00:04:01	00:04:02	1	mhm 
00:04:02	00:04:15	2	which would have been a year long out service fellowship up in chicago which the the town that they had this fellowship and was like five minutes from where i went to college right ten minutes from where i went to 
00:04:15	00:04:22	1	school right so i think that'd be great you know but er they pick some physician to go 
00:04:22	00:04:30	2	yeah so the only other choices they gave me it was either a great mistakes or twenty nine palms mhm and 
00:04:30	00:04:32	1	detail or um 
00:04:32	00:04:48	2	i said well let me think about it for a while and and probably forty five minutes after i hung up with her she called me back and said that she had spoken to the director nursing out at twenty nine palms mhm and the director nursing out there 
00:04:48	00:04:51	1	wanted me to be the department 
00:04:51	00:05:00	2	further emergency nursing wow so i don't know this lady but um you know i've got myself especially in that 
00:05:00	00:05:01	1	mhm 
00:05:01	00:05:06	2	the experience that i've got so yeah i've actually got back to her and say yeah go ahead and go out 
00:05:06	00:05:07	1	yeah

00:05:15	00:05:17	2	uh well it'd be an zone next 
00:05:17	00:05:20	1	okay so that wouldn't leave department heads 
00:05:20	00:05:23	2	no no i i guess we gotta deep selected 
00:05:32	00:05:37	1	i also heard and i think i heard it's martha i heard barney had some kind of terminal disease 
00:05:37	00:05:46	2	well barney has cancer okay uh he had some sort of ah um mouth in throat cancer yeah 
00:05:46	00:05:48	1	no he's a big golf or right 
00:05:48	00:05:53	2	and golfers tend to when after they <unk> they stick their golf t. in their mouth 
00:05:53	00:05:54	1	oh no 
00:05:54	00:06:02	2	yeah well they think that this cancer develops from the the bug spray and er we'd killer that they put on the the grass 
00:06:02	00:06:04	1	oh man yeah so i 
00:06:04	00:06:14	2	<unk> i was back in the states in march and um i saw barney at those convention and i was at and he was a skinny as you are 
00:06:14	00:06:19	1	you're kidding me no good guy 'cause he was always built like a <unk> or something 
00:06:36	00:06:38	1	asian right 
00:06:46	00:06:55	2	but then yeah he worked for a general uh crew lack oh 
00:06:55	00:07:16	1	okay oh okay you just said the magic word <unk> i got you yeah i've got another buddy who uh is a marine pilot i'm trying to think you'd ever met this guy i don't think so he um worked for him as an aid and so he would check on the other day we'll probably of the day the other year when you heard crew like had been selected to be the next big boy that he thought you know bill whatever happens i'm good to go there 
00:07:16	00:07:21	2	oh yeah yeah it was it was a real surprised there 
00:07:26	00:07:46	2	spend a whole lot of time that the the cancer yeah but i i asked him i said you know at some point blank and said what was the what the prognosis was yeah and he said poor um but you didn't say terminal yeah um okay i think i'd kind of assumed that i guess from talking to market 'cause she may have over a glorified it i don't know 
00:07:46	00:07:48	1	well yeah 
00:07:48	00:07:52	2	and <unk> is down in san diego 
00:07:53	00:08:00	2	and i talked to her fairly frequently and she said that um she just saw him a couple of months ago mhm 
00:08:02	00:08:03	2	so super 
00:08:03	00:08:06	1	you know i don't know whether they manage to get all accounts 
00:08:06	00:08:10	2	with the chemo and the radiation or or what but uh 
00:08:12	00:08:18	2	came out i didn't even have to look you know because i knew that both barney now where um 
00:08:18	00:08:25	1	eligible <unk> not end zone but eligible mhm yeah i knew anybody he would be the one that would be deep so i could 
00:08:25	00:08:35	2	well being a buttons with old <unk> didn't hurt things <unk> oh no not at all and you know when i ran into him uh in march it was it 
00:08:35	00:08:40	1	[noise] some symposium in san diego nurse core thing yeah 
00:08:40	00:08:45	2	and um admiral angle to never score and roll was there and 
00:08:45	00:08:49	1	yeah the barney knows her like their best but 
00:08:49	00:08:57	2	[laughter] oh yeah i mean there weren't you pictures with vice president signs on stretchers uh no not yet 
00:09:12	00:09:14	1	follow up yeah 
00:09:14	00:09:17	2	and then he'll probably go back to the admirals staff is mike 
00:09:17	00:09:18	1	yes yeah 
00:09:18	00:09:23	2	i got 'em going to laugh too when you talk to my old names member john's otto

00:09:26	00:09:42	2	into san diego have doing call martha and i got the whole history onyx on this or martha and so you know i don't want to go out he ended up totally blowing her off i think to where she was waiting for a couple of hours and then came growing up on a motorcycle dead drunk or something so yeah you know so what's to eat and stuff like that and just [laughter] 
00:09:42	00:09:43	1	well

00:12:43	00:12:54	1	gotten into like a six month active duty staying with him to work what they call the counter drugs thing which is basically just sitting there training programs to assist police agencies and all this and loan them <unk> seventy seven it's no big flashy deal 
00:12:54	00:12:55	2	and uh 
00:12:55	00:12:57	1	[noise] so i was working fulltime 
00:13:14	00:13:15	1	[noise] 
00:13:26	00:13:27	1	oh yeah 
00:13:34	00:13:42	2	and ah too many old expectations and all this kind of stuff and and i think what did it for powell was one day you roll it over and looking at her saint palette you know i just don't find you physically 
00:13:42	00:13:43	1	anymore oh no 
00:13:43	00:13:49	2	oh you said too it's a silly you really really kind of you you draw your line in the sand right there 
00:13:49	00:13:53	1	yeah you wanna make sure you wear like a metal collar the oh yeah it was bad oh 
00:14:11	00:14:24	2	when i finished the marine corps work i had made a good pile of money and really say that i had a little bit from dads the states i decided i'm going to take a couple of months i really decided that this e._s._l. thing how i want to do this and takes a good month two months absolute vacation and kind of recover from 
00:14:24	00:14:26	1	<unk> and i clean up all day i just ate 
00:14:26	00:14:28	2	<unk> yeah so you 
00:14:28	00:14:35	1	came down and we spent about a month and a half together and we just had to go to disney world and we went down there and had a great vacation is the greatest place in the world 
00:14:35	00:14:38	2	came back um had a good time 
00:14:43	00:14:53	2	and that we would think about the idea so she was still in california with his great part time deal of her company sending her to e._s._l. school there and paying her salary the same time 
00:14:53	00:14:54	1	[noise] 
00:14:54	00:14:59	2	she really wanted to think seriously i would be willing to talk about the idea of moving in together out there 
00:14:59	00:15:00	1	as long as they didn't compromise my 
00:15:00	00:15:02	2	planes to go and get this degree 
00:15:04	00:15:16	2	<unk> but i guess you gotta fix to her mind i was going to go to san francisco what any route she had to go on back and early november decided she'd come back again for christmas it's been another bit [noise] and we'd find a lousy plans we wanted to try and do this move thing 
00:15:16	00:15:17	1	[noise] 
00:15:17	00:15:34	2	so she came for christmas and i could tell from day one she was just kind of not herself so a lot you know you know i don't know what the deal is here she's japanese or emotional strategy is different ah i'm not quite sure what's going on she may be a spy for the the japanese mafia who knows what any route finally i forced to like you know you eat 
00:15:34	00:15:35	1	what the heck is going on here 
00:15:35	00:15:45	2	i had forgotten i told her on the phone 'cause she was getting all upset about a lot of things that fact she had other boyfriends when she's young we're not worried about that and said uh i don't care you know that's 
00:15:45	00:15:46	1	the past i said you 
00:15:46	00:15:48	2	and you're so worried about power 
00:15:48	00:15:51	1	she says oh bill i'm so worried all the time you go 
00:15:51	00:16:06	2	the palestinians that's impossible i mean she was even here this summer and we decided to make a complete break the things i know that i had zero interest in her and i could tell you for a fact now she is not any element my future will set of hearing that all you heard of course was <unk> it was here this 
00:16:06	00:16:07	1	yeah and so 
00:16:07	00:16:23	2	that became a big deal so any way to christmas she was saying you know i just can't get set in my head and she didn't tell me about that and so now i'm feeling like a big dishonest characters like we gave me i told you that show you how much trust is there and the fact that she's totally out of my life you've got no worry at all 'cause you'll be kept harp in an urban area on this i'm so worried about 
00:16:23	00:16:24	1	[noise] so 
00:16:24	00:16:40	2	right we finally got into one big argument and we'd never had an <unk> before you got all stressed out and we decided she was just gonna go back early that we were still you know close and everything but we just need to both settled down a cool down and she'd get over to see anything so she goes back just before christmas 
00:16:40	00:16:45	1	so this was made it a great christmas goes on <unk> california and where you know <unk> that time 
00:16:45	00:16:50	2	and i thought well let's call each other a couple of weeks and cool down and we'll plan maybe i'll come out there for spring break or something 
00:16:50	00:16:52	1	cause i go to get 
00:16:52	00:16:58	2	the new orleans for one semester and see if i could still get an academics before i got into a master's program 
00:16:58	00:17:00	1	yeah because there's dirt cheap to go 
00:17:00	00:17:18	2	so i started calling her and i couldn't find her and it turns out she had moved into a japanese couple apartment out there to house sit for who don't have a phone no problems i called her her little friends and buddies out there and uh i could never seem to get a hold of me it was a big run around so finally after about four weeks of this and her never called me i called her sister in tokyo which i look 
00:17:18	00:17:19	1	you know 
00:17:19	00:17:24	2	her name is june so i need to get in touch with humid you know where she is she was like oh phew 
00:17:24	00:17:26	1	i would like to think you force for being 
00:17:26	00:17:31	2	so good that to my sister and i thought oh years ago she gives me the number and i think 
00:17:31	00:17:32	1	i know this number 
00:17:32	00:17:53	2	for some reason i i've always had a photographic number for phone numbers i know this number so i play james bond i go to my own phone records and evidently one day when i had to be gone all day when he was in new orleans and went to the writers conference 'cause i was still thinking about doing we're right on the side mhm and uh just never had been called for like forty five minutes and i never thought anything about it i just assumed it was a call you may tutor buddy 
00:17:53	00:17:54	1	[noise] so 
00:17:54	00:18:05	2	this number and i get to this answering machine and it's a guy's voice in english and it's another japanese uh lady's voice in japanese and i thought okay you mean stay with another couple of years she doesn't want me to know about and 
00:18:05	00:18:06	1	uh-huh 
00:18:14	00:18:21	2	nobody wants to pick up so i'm just gonna sit here on the phone this phone refill bananas steamed haven't taken four weeks to track her down 
00:18:21	00:18:23	1	[noise] so it's a guy finally picks up the phone 
00:18:23	00:18:31	2	and i said excuse me it's humid here and i thought you said she's in france and i said what she's not there he said no this is her fiance 
00:18:31	00:18:33	1	hello 
00:18:33	00:18:40	2	holy mackerel yeah i mean you talk about no warning some like a said who is this and i said well this is who used to be your boyfriend i guess 
00:18:40	00:18:43	1	[laughter] 
00:18:43	00:18:53	2	i can't remember his name on earth is barney or close or whatever he was <unk> was embarrassed to be on the phone so i have you know i don't know who these guys are have any problem with him or anything i i wish the poor bastard luck 
00:18:53	00:18:54	1	but um 
00:18:54	00:19:02	2	[noise] i said basically it was humid there and it's funny in touch with her what she said well bill uh hang on a second and got back on it i don't think she wants to talk to you so i was like 
00:19:02	00:19:10	1	okay well you know tell her i said the chow or whatever and that was it and boy i was hot because after all this you know investment of time and <unk> he was all this 
00:19:10	00:19:13	2	be like you're so close to you 
00:19:13	00:19:20	1	yeah i think she was working if not the green card angle she wanted to stay in california so she probably had another boyfriend out there and decided to 
00:19:20	00:19:27	2	if a scout marry me and my idea was made so of course at that point once again is forrest gump would say swore off women ugh 
00:19:27	00:19:30	1	and and decided never get in trouble again 
00:19:30	00:19:34	2	and this is what it really got funny 'cause i just devoting myself to academics 
00:19:34	00:19:43	1	you know went and made real good grades you went to university of who wants to that one semester and had fun doing that and was working part time was a private tutor teaching english 
00:19:43	00:19:45	2	uh-huh and then uh got accepted to school 
00:19:45	00:19:48	1	and started making plans to roll up and get out of there 
00:19:59	00:20:11	2	screwed us i've been screwing you access because i was engaged to an italian girl relationship with japanese girl and went out and got very involved with this german girl so i looked it up in the history books and technically romania within the access 
00:20:11	00:20:14	1	so i need to pick up a gypsy and i'll be complete 
00:20:14	00:20:17	2	well yeah yeah 
00:20:17	00:20:28	1	no i got better and better but i went ahead and cut ties to the marine corps reserve if you could i don't know if you're a big maybe times reader you might see my article in there [noise] oh no i didn't 
00:20:28	00:20:38	2	but you know they have the marine corps addition now too yeah and uh after i finished with the counter drugs saying they had how these promises about bill used a great guy who was an active reserve program coming up you'd be super for it 
00:20:38	00:20:41	1	i know that was a house of cards distorted crumble and i could see 
00:20:41	00:20:43	2	a lot of politics and stuff going on 
00:20:43	00:20:45	1	people who are coming in we're bringing their 
00:20:45	00:20:46	2	boys in so to speak 
00:20:46	00:20:52	1	yeah and so i knew there wouldn't be a future and i just ask them well since i'm trying to fit when well do you guys want me to work for the next 
00:20:52	00:21:02	2	six months or not 'cause technically i can do that and it was kind of him and haunt him in home for the last day and so i find that when i'm walking this is it i'll just get into a little reserve units somewhere if i want to do reserves stuff 
00:21:02	00:21:05	1	yeah and uh they owed me let's see 
00:21:05	00:21:15	2	about a month and a half two months pay because the system is shut down on pay me just before that plus it would be travel pay for all these exotic places i go over the counter drugs too 
00:21:15	00:21:16	1	[noise] so 
00:21:16	00:21:19	2	it took about six and a half months for them to pay me 
00:21:23	00:21:25	2	desk 
00:21:25	00:21:27	1	literally had just been shutting the desk and put away 
00:21:27	00:21:40	2	yeah and then i got better better so finally i went up through all the chain of command you know went through the ministry chains hit every week it on the line and nobody up to uh take colonels would give me a straight answer whatever so i said okay let's just right the navy 
00:21:40	00:21:40	1	mhm 
00:21:40	00:21:44	2	and er fax him an article and they put it right in the navy times 
00:21:44	00:21:47	1	gotta check within a week 
00:21:47	00:22:02	2	at the same time i told him you know that's this is kind of it for me guys you've romeo and this and plus i knew if i was gonna go overseas and teach carry i didn't want to get recalled the buys me when i'm you know just checking into somewhere so i went ahead and cut ties in uh <unk> yeah he retired and he 
00:22:02	00:22:08	1	in close touch with me and written recommendations for a couple of grad school and said you know bill you may think i'm a strange when to say this but 
00:22:08	00:22:10	2	you are cut ties you've had 
00:22:10	00:22:13	1	good time you've done fun stuff sounds like you're in a real political bunch it

00:22:35	00:22:37	2	oh okay right 
00:22:37	00:22:42	1	well see i tried i was gonna grow a ponytail and i figured out i couldn't 
00:22:42	00:22:51	2	these two things down the sides of my head it looked like i was a jewish uh les reader or something but i couldn't get a pony tail to go so i kept it fairly short and uh 
00:22:51	00:22:56	1	that's the way more careful with it plus our decide you know if i started to grow it lawn i may find that i have bald spots 
00:22:56	00:22:58	2	so yeah well 
00:22:58	00:23:01	1	safe and they're not bringing the extra gray and then i don't need

00:23:11	00:23:13	1	<unk> where are you looking in europe 
00:23:13	00:23:32	2	no actually i want to go back to asia but i got to spend six months um an age where the marine corps and you know three that no <unk> yeah and uh literally ten minutes and korea just go with an airfield so i've thought about it and for a few reasons first is the pay is the best over there and a demand for english teachers is just uh 
00:23:32	00:23:35	1	oh yeah <unk> and it's 
00:24:00	00:24:02	2	if you were in oregon 
00:24:02	00:24:05	1	in japan of course you can make huge books is just try not to spend them 
00:24:05	00:24:08	2	yeah but i got into a uh 
00:24:08	00:24:14	1	[noise] a program to school with a teen i._t. little school called the school for international training in a little town in vermont and i mean it's it's 
00:24:14	00:24:26	2	purpose is to really teach people to either teach english uh in the states or overseas and and uh i thought you know paying back grad school loans plus the fact that i i love the japanese culture or when i'm going to go 
00:24:26	00:24:32	1	asia i think uh plus the fact that i still find rental girls extremely cute 
00:24:32	00:24:37	2	well i tell you know you may want to think about staying away from tokyo 
00:24:37	00:24:41	1	well that's my first idea i have no desire to go to tokyo 
00:24:41	00:24:42	2	um 
00:24:42	00:24:45	1	and i know that 
00:25:04	00:25:10	1	oh in this part of the island down here is not nearly as bad as it is that in tokyo right 
00:25:10	00:25:16	2	so <unk> you know as close as everything is if you really wanna see tokyo i think it's a great place to visit but i wouldn't wanna live there 
00:25:16	00:25:17	1	oh yeah 
00:25:17	00:25:19	2	up to <unk> 
00:25:20	00:25:46	2	that was i was thinking about all the japanese people tell me not to go 'cause it's cold but either where you are down in the south are up in the north and and kind of where my first couple of choices because i think you're right to get away from tokyo and universities um you know in other places are screaming for people because all the americans that just want to go on a lark and teach all want to go tokyo or killed or whatever and all the pros want to go to the big universities in tokyo and all that and you're right the ones that 
00:25:46	00:25:48	1	to be just the ads obscene 
00:25:54	00:25:56	1	oh yeah that's just what you need 
00:25:56	00:25:57	2	[laughter] 
00:25:57	00:26:01	1	some girls high school here or not caring

00:26:11	00:26:15	1	one time [laughter] and i'm good how are you 
00:26:15	00:26:40	2	using assisted if you need to ah if you want to read [laughter] there's this one guy i met down your walks is a retired navy commander just got out name hank ah baldwin and hanks a trip you would really like this guy he's into running but he's fairly normal guy and he had been stationed in south america few times and done e._s._l. the sly and he to kind of feel that he loved to do this and he thought wow they'll pay me for this this is gravy and he was just dragging on me to go to 
00:26:40	00:26:42	1	to ah south america 
00:26:42	00:26:51	2	you got to peru but we talk columbia the women are just kill you and i thought you know there's one place i don't want to go with short hair and always ex military tee shirts his two it drug country 
00:26:58	00:27:00	1	huge number 
00:27:00	00:27:10	2	of americans i mean just go but i decided caribbean thirty three and this be the second career i gotta have some job security and i think the masters will do that 'cause i know you really want to stay in for a career 
00:27:10	00:27:12	1	oh without a doubt 
00:27:12	00:27:18	2	exactly and uh it's it's a stepping stone other places i got into a special dorm program up there 
00:27:18	00:27:18	1	[noise] 
00:27:18	00:27:24	2	um at this little school that proctor and gamble japan division promotes and they'll give you like i'm i'm going to be in a sweet 
00:27:24	00:27:26	1	instead of just like winning dorm room 
00:27:26	00:27:35	2	being a sweet with the japanese executive in a different comes in every month and while i'm going to school i'm just kind of running buddy i have a couple of meals a week with them and kind of just teach them informal english 
00:27:35	00:27:37	1	yeah it just helps me relax 
00:27:37	00:27:46	2	to look around vermont and for that i get the sweet and also that's another way to make the the good bucks is to get hired by a company in japan to teach the employees english 
00:27:46	00:27:47	1	yeah and it just 
00:27:47	00:27:53	2	some contacts and ask these guys you know what city would you recommend do you have a second cousin when your mom's side he works in uh hiroshima or whatever 
00:27:53	00:27:55	1	and uh 
00:27:55	00:27:55	2	mhm

00:28:24	00:28:31	1	i know what you mean and that's the other big draw from japan and they say bill if you'll go as a six foot american you'll always get hired because the japanese people 
00:28:31	00:28:41	2	no that all their teachers are japanese and you know yeah they gotta come over and say you know these guys when it come over and <unk> they don't want to say <unk> to find a re meet you
