00:11:45	00:11:50	2	[laughter] i don't know but it was 
00:11:50	00:11:51	1	[noise] although i think

00:13:22	00:13:27	1	a p._h._d. thing if they ever accept me but yeah plus that the other thing i don't think that except for 
00:13:27	00:13:36	2	that's cool well um because i don't know i don't have a four point oh and they also don't particularly like to bring back their own um in the psych department 
00:13:36	00:13:37	1	oh um 
00:13:37	00:13:41	2	and so i went to like to see what other people are doing you know

00:14:08	00:14:11	2	well he's lucky that 
00:14:11	00:14:16	1	why am i so tired oh my god [laughter] 
00:14:23	00:14:26	1	same here but i just didn't even bother studying 
00:14:26	00:14:32	2	about it i don't do much but that's okay it was all snowing it's like a big blizzard 
00:14:32	00:14:41	1	i didn't leave the room one <unk> one of the days well i went down to give the delivery guy his money but like other than that i did not leave the room except to go to the bathroom i think so 
00:14:41	00:14:54	2	but [laughter] she didn't think it was healthy i don't know why but [laughter] i was like if i were at home i could do this for weeks [laughter] not even leave the house like during the summer i'll realize i'm like wow it's been like seven days i haven't even been outside 
00:14:58	00:15:13	2	mhm that's our i'm at home too though we're getting out okay we're going to go up to boston huh we're definitely going over to providence i want to even check out new york i went to go to maybe like um one of the art museums or something on a day trip 
00:15:13	00:15:20	1	yeah something in new york it's so expensive yeah like i probably won't have the money [laughter] 
00:15:20	00:15:30	2	that i live up like good <unk> i haven't been to new york in a long time i'm not going to be able to go for like a long time so 
00:15:30	00:15:34	1	that would be able to maybe my mother will go with us and she'll let us take a shopping 
00:15:34	00:15:37	2	oh see i don't think i have money for that 
00:15:42	00:15:46	2	cool and then i don't see why we can't go to boston that's no problem 
00:15:46	00:15:48	1	oh yes and then 
00:15:48	00:15:51	2	basically taking for granted we're going to boston katie 
00:15:51	00:16:01	1	and i have a friend in rockport that she transfer to connect college and i told her i going to go see her but she wants to go see a new year's eve and it was like i don't know if i'll be able to do that but it's near gloucester where my roommate lived 
00:16:01	00:16:14	2	<unk> like north of boston she's awesome liz she transfer to connecticut college and [noise] well she was actually <unk> girlfriend last semester [laughter] so we've been having conversation 
00:16:14	00:16:15	1	get around huh 
00:16:15	00:16:20	2	yeah i know i wouldn't say that <unk> listen i are very much alike 
00:16:23	00:16:40	2	actually a lot of the guys that have like always like all the guys at school like who have like this or like the same people it's really strange were very much alike and like we're becoming a really good friends friends last semester but then she liked transferred so [laughter] so it was just weird but we've probably would have been really good friends that she not left 
00:16:40	00:16:41	1	[noise] 
00:16:41	00:16:50	2	[noise] i usually try and probably not concerned i haven't done anything about it um are you kind of happy like where you are now huh i'm just whatever 
00:16:50	00:16:51	1	[laughter] 
00:16:51	00:16:55	2	not actively hating it no 
00:16:55	00:16:58	1	i'd probably be better if i were junk but 
00:16:58	00:17:01	2	[laughter] well you know that's a <unk> a lot of students 
00:17:01	00:17:07	1	oh yeah no i <unk> i probably won't 'cause i haven't done it 
00:17:10	00:17:22	1	hopefully i will look at <unk> and then we'll be kicking myself for not having transferred but [laughter] is it possible to transfer just like the last year or does anybody 
00:17:28	00:17:31	1	you could try graduating <unk> 
00:17:31	00:17:44	2	i don't know if i'd be able to i mean actually i have a ton of credits but like i haven't like fulfilled many how many pets for my major how many classes i filled okay let's say [noise] 
00:17:44	00:17:48	1	one to two [laughter] too 
00:17:48	00:17:49	2	basically 
00:17:49	00:17:54	1	probably feel too sorry no two three two summer <unk> three i think 
00:17:54	00:18:01	2	yeah so just charge says to me i haven't done any requirements i have two major [laughter] 
00:18:01	00:18:03	1	oh yeah 
00:18:03	00:18:14	2	well the thing that sucks is that i could have declared english major my freshman year and that would've been cool i would have been all set except i decided not to declare yet i was i mean i should have just declared and if i wanted to change 
00:18:14	00:18:16	1	just change yeah 'cause then they 
00:18:26	00:18:31	2	class and if i had declared as a freshman wish i could have because i came in for selling all my like 
00:18:31	00:18:36	1	requirements for it for the <unk> like you had your you have to keep take college writing and i got out of it 
00:18:36	00:18:39	2	the test over like break over the 
00:18:39	00:18:43	1	orientation i mean so i would have been all set but no 
00:18:43	00:18:45	2	i was stupid [laughter] 
00:19:08	00:19:12	1	[laughter] i don't think so okay [laughter] 
00:19:14	00:19:16	1	[laughter] 
00:19:16	00:19:17	2	that'll never happen but 
00:19:17	00:19:19	1	[noise] it'd be nice 
00:19:19	00:19:33	2	so it would be nice yeah i'm sure like if i really i don't know like what i want to take the creative writing class and but but like if i had gone like say i'd go on the first day and was like hey if you don't have if not enough people find out can i come in but i'm sure like that's completely filled 
00:19:33	00:19:34	1	you know yeah 
00:19:34	00:19:39	2	so um so i'm taking a writing workshop next semester it's it's like 
00:19:39	00:19:42	1	it's actually i <unk> i <unk> i didn't even know it was in the 
00:19:42	00:19:55	2	booklet it is it just made by arrangement and i saw a sign an english department for like five different possible workshop so i signed up for one it's on thursdays from like four to six which means i'll be in bartlett hall from like noon to eight thirty on thursdays next 
00:19:55	00:19:57	1	which is not 
00:19:57	00:20:06	2	but um so i signed up for that and influence weekends pass fail so i have four english classes and a six credit japanese costs let me tell a day so but the <unk> 
00:20:06	00:20:13	1	it's just like i'm not even worried about it like that's like my own personal enjoyment so [laughter] that's like an extra curricular activity in mine [laughter] 
00:20:13	00:20:22	2	yeah pretty much watch out for attendance so i had to make up a weight training class because i didn't go to like one more than we are allowed to like i didn't go to for 
00:20:22	00:20:27	1	and you have to like you can only go to three without making them out and i was going to fail i didn't make one after i had to go 
00:20:27	00:20:46	2	they were going to <unk> all those years a pass fail oh see i um i went to in class and it today and i've missed five and like that's you're only allowed three but then like i'm somehow i was allowed five i don't know how that figured out and i swear i didn't miss five classes but they're telling me i didn't i don't have a record so i'm like okay but i guess we get extra points if we've improved 
00:20:46	00:20:48	1	dark technique or weight training 
00:20:48	00:20:59	2	so i'm all set like today was my last class so like yeah but like so i get we get grades like you get some people's g._p._a.s uh brought down because they like skip like field hockey or something 
00:20:59	00:21:00	1	i know a girl who could have had a <unk> 
00:21:00	00:21:02	2	porno like last semester

00:21:06	00:21:08	1	oh my god like wasn't worth it 
00:21:08	00:21:25	2	far as you can say like either pass fail a grade but i just said forget it i'm not going to like bring down 'cause i was totally i don't want to go to this i don't want to do this assignment i pass and just like do some weight training stuff you know switching migrating options yeah glad i did i wasn't like a c._n._n. yogurt weak
