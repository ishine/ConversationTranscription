00:08:17	00:08:18	1	oh see i didn't do it on <unk> 
00:08:18	00:08:22	2	i do is i compose and then to send it i have to do a flash session 
00:08:22	00:08:24	1	and then it takes very little 
00:08:35	00:08:36	1	but i'm gonna look into it 
00:08:36	00:08:44	2	me i will because of a lot of people are going on line and then i have to actually go on line to retrieve my messages i can 
00:08:44	00:08:45	1	you have to go on line 
00:08:45	00:08:54	2	um i can read them off in other words they'll kind of you know know what you need to leave them on line but then turn off the last session oh like 
00:08:56	00:08:59	2	turned off yeah i didn't know i have to read 
00:08:59	00:09:02	1	them well other on oh see i go

00:09:35	00:09:37	1	[noise] i'm going to try it when it's 
00:09:37	00:09:43	2	but it's it's when it's turned off so you have to sort of receive them on line 
00:09:43	00:09:47	1	and then you could eat them off and do you want to rent them off oh that's fabulous 
00:09:47	00:09:49	2	for me um

00:10:36	00:10:39	1	hours uh-huh we can't even use it up 
00:10:39	00:10:43	2	because we don't really like to get on and chat and waste all that time

00:16:45	00:16:46	1	get married there can be

00:18:30	00:18:39	2	right so he said i don't know i have to ever call you so i think he's going to they're going to drop out yeah cause i think she has so much real resistance to this 
00:18:39	00:18:41	1	fine the excuses 
00:18:41	00:18:43	2	[noise] so if they're like if it a couple of other
