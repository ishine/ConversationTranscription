00:15:34	00:15:36	1	people guidance 
00:15:36	00:15:36	2	they 
00:15:37	00:15:47	2	that that would be it you know 'cause he's seen a lot in his religion answers that they don't have any problems but you know people kind of go astray and these different 
00:15:47	00:15:48	1	they don't know 
00:15:48	00:15:59	2	you know and it's funny because it's i learn about the jewish religion they see the same thing you see all these divisions happening and all these questions and you ask you know there's the old joke 
00:16:01	00:16:03	2	if you ask uh three jewish 
00:16:03	00:16:06	1	manifest in you'll get more opinions 
00:16:06	00:16:10	2	so that i mean they're just they're very 
00:16:14	00:16:24	2	'cause you know there's the ultra orthodox and formed and anyway um and so he was just saying that uh 
00:16:24	00:16:26	1	never thought that that was right 
00:16:26	00:16:29	2	and he said when i um 
00:16:29	00:16:31	1	i am with your profit 
00:16:31	00:16:32	2	isn't it hunter 
00:16:32	00:16:33	1	i 
00:16:33	00:16:35	1	he says i cannot explain it 
00:16:35	00:16:43	2	feelings inside and then he takes you know what i mean and we were all this island you know it's not 
00:16:43	00:16:45	1	[laughter] he says 
00:16:45	00:16:50	2	just cannot help that deal that this is a man 
00:16:50	00:16:54	2	and it was is there's this really neat you know and it's 
00:16:54	00:17:00	1	things like that but i learn about and yeah just walk away 
00:17:00	00:17:10	2	stop lifted and just like wow you know that's really true yeah my testimony is i just feel like is really being strength but just by learning about 
00:17:10	00:17:19	2	you know these different religion in may so grateful for what we have i mean i mean yeah we really do have a profit of god 
00:17:19	00:17:20	1	and 
00:17:21	00:17:23	2	and how lucky we are 
00:17:23	00:17:24	1	he can 
00:17:24	00:17:30	1	he can lead us in the direction that we need to go you know and then we don't have to worry about 
00:17:30	00:17:38	2	boston's like there was religion um a lot of that a lotta things a lot of the divisions came 
00:17:38	00:17:43	2	when the modern world started coming into and 
00:17:43	00:17:44	1	they didn't know 
00:17:44	00:17:46	1	exactly how to handle it 
00:17:46	00:17:49	2	so many of them started having 
00:17:49	00:17:50	1	different ideas 
00:17:51	00:17:59	1	you know well this is how we should handle that that's how we handle it and wanted to stick strictly to the 
00:17:59	00:18:01	2	so the law of moses you know what the bible 
00:18:01	00:18:02	1	that is 
00:18:02	00:18:06	2	and others you know kind of want it to assimilate with modern world 
00:18:10	00:18:14	2	you know when things like that happen things change in the world 
00:18:20	00:18:22	1	mhm right 
00:18:22	00:18:29	2	maybe he's running around with each other it's necessary but the profit has let us know you know what to do about that and and i mean so many other 
00:18:29	00:18:32	1	things that i mean how <unk> guided 
00:18:32	00:18:34	1	and how 
00:18:34	00:18:37	1	you know if if this problem 
00:18:37	00:18:40	2	man he's been muslim all his life and who 
00:18:40	00:18:44	2	yeah he <unk> he says you don't realize how lucky you are 
00:18:44	00:18:46	1	it'd be in a place where you have 
00:18:47	00:18:48	2	pardon 
00:18:48	00:18:49	1	uh-huh 
00:18:51	00:18:58	2	where you can feel they bend into the spirit you know where you have to <unk> we are so blessed 
00:19:00	00:19:02	1	and uh i think i think that he likes 
00:19:02	00:19:06	2	joined the church i think that you believe that is true 
00:19:06	00:19:07	1	but um 
00:19:07	00:19:08	2	yeah 
00:19:08	00:19:13	2	it's it's culture and they used to do this but um 
00:19:13	00:19:22	1	if the muslim converted their family members could go out and kill him because you know they believe that it was better 
00:19:22	00:19:25	2	for them to die physically then for they're still be damned 
00:19:27	00:19:29	2	so anyway somebody asked him 
00:19:29	00:19:31	1	he said well you know we 
00:19:31	00:19:32	1	we don't 
00:19:32	00:19:34	2	we don't really do that 
00:19:34	00:19:35	1	more 
00:19:35	00:19:41	2	but you said they're more ways to be killed you know physically i think um 
00:19:42	00:19:45	1	when he was helping the centre he got death 
00:19:45	00:19:46	2	threats all the time 
00:19:46	00:19:48	1	oh like family 
00:19:48	00:19:49	2	danger and 
00:19:50	00:19:52	1	anyway so i think it would be 
00:19:52	00:20:05	2	it be really hard for him to do that but he says you know you are the only people i can tell these things too you know his feelings but sure cause i cannot tell these <unk> my arab friends that would be very upset [laughter] 
00:20:05	00:20:05	1	mhm

00:20:07	00:20:09	2	right it's really

00:22:11	00:22:14	2	they're well they're little pieces of paper 
00:22:14	00:22:16	1	um they're all broken up 
00:22:16	00:22:19	2	oh yeah a lot of them are um 
00:22:20	00:22:31	2	but they've got you know hebrew cared they've got the hebrew riding on him and you know i'm learning hebrew and so they go through and i can recognize you know no uh no some of the characters 
00:22:31	00:22:32	1	the 
00:22:34	00:22:36	2	that can read hebrew 
00:22:36	00:22:37	1	and 
00:22:37	00:22:38	2	very today can read 
00:22:49	00:22:52	2	i just looked like very old pieces of paper 
00:22:55	00:22:59	2	and what's the writing though that like um <unk> 
00:22:59	00:23:02	1	yeah it's lacking in it um pretty tiny

00:23:10	00:23:12	1	the vows in it

00:23:16	00:23:18	2	underneath the letters 
00:23:23	00:23:33	2	[laughter] that's right that's that's strange concept for me to understand how they can read something without without that like the children's books have thousand um
