00:14:52	00:15:05	1	and then you know of course it cost two hundred dollars just to apply whether you get it or not you know and you don't always have we don't we just don't have the extra money to go in and just think you know if it doesn't work route two hundred 
00:15:05	00:15:13	2	right well that sort of like the same when i went down in arizona yeah well you had even though you had your um 
00:15:15	00:15:15	1	mhm

00:15:37	00:15:41	2	yes you went yeah yeah see i have a feeling it would be the same 
00:15:41	00:15:44	1	i think that's all states you know like if you get your 
00:15:44	00:15:51	2	you get certified in one state than you when you go to another state you have to get certified there may be certified yeah 
00:15:51	00:15:58	1	mhm mhm yep exactly [noise] so i just have to get on that paper work done
