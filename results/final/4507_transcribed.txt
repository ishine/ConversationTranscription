00:00:25	00:00:27	2	um we get paid every two weeks 
00:00:41	00:00:43	1	didn't uh-huh and so 
00:00:46	00:00:48	1	but um

00:00:54	00:00:56	2	i sure am nursing school oh 
00:00:56	00:00:59	1	wow do you handle the finances and you're 
00:01:05	00:01:14	2	since we got married about ten years ago oh really mhm hi tried at once but it just didn't seem i mean it was pretty depressing some months it look like 
00:01:14	00:01:26	1	i mean i'd have a negative when i compared to how much money we had coming into how much money we had gone out uh-huh i mean i know theoretically how that happens but it would turn out to be like there would be negatives and it got pretty depressing 
00:01:26	00:01:40	2	budget or or purchases like if we were going by refrigerator for example uh-huh and we had to take a loan for that than deciding how quick i wanted to pay it off or what i could afford i double the payment yeah and maybe paid off in the year 
00:01:40	00:01:41	1	yeah 
00:01:41	00:01:52	2	so i would figure out and that's the only way we've been able to buy big item it seems like you know when your furniture and you know bedroom season we need to budget it yeah 
00:01:52	00:02:01	1	and then you know you meet the most payment we can meet and yet still do okay <unk> and it's worked out for you how many large things have you bought 
00:02:01	00:02:06	2	uh everything oh really <unk> we got better time we 
00:02:06	00:02:11	1	been kind of hit and miss i guess and when we know when we have a bill that fixing to be 
00:02:18	00:02:21	1	loans and we do basically the same thing but we <unk> i don't 
00:02:21	00:02:27	2	put it on paper i just um i i'm very financially 
00:02:27	00:02:27	1	mhm 
00:02:27	00:02:45	2	he quit mentally you know what i mean i'm i know how to do these things down ride it out but it just seemed to work out for us i ride it out every time and i like sometimes even do it a paycheck ahead oh yeah just to figure out next time in the next two weeks what i'll have left over and then we can use that money uh-huh 
00:02:45	00:02:49	1	according to what we need and not going to tell you we're not <unk> 
00:02:49	00:02:59	2	<unk> because then the college i am you know we're living at at a rate that would just barely getting by yeah until i graduate and then we'll go double our income 
00:02:59	00:03:05	1	<unk> great when you do my sister just graduated from medical college so i know that'll that'll be great for you 
00:03:05	00:03:07	2	i'm looking forward to it i bet 
00:03:07	00:03:11	1	even in that way we figured if we just turn all my pay check 
00:03:11	00:03:13	2	uh-huh 
00:03:18	00:03:21	1	you know so that's kind of what we're looking at 
00:03:21	00:03:30	2	yeah now that's not including student loans right right but those longer so much cheaper uh-huh you're wiser smart keep those too 
00:03:30	00:03:37	1	yeah yeah they're they're fun it is it pretty low interest rate most of the time they they certainly are yeah seven or eight percent that's a good deal 
00:03:37	00:03:40	2	yeah well could make it without though 
00:03:40	00:03:42	1	but even so i kind of budget like um 
00:03:42	00:03:50	2	what i'll be able to afford even when i graduate how much those loans are going to add up to be you know so that i know exactly what i'll be going 
00:03:50	00:03:54	1	do you spend a lot of time though uh mapping out your budget and 
00:03:54	00:04:01	2	[noise] no one's been doing this for so long now yeah that um i just automatically can help 
00:04:01	00:04:07	1	[noise] do you remember when you got started what how it was the enemy <unk> getting the same difficult 
00:04:07	00:04:17	2	no we've always done this yeah i don't know how or why we were first got married we wanted lots of things yeah and the only way we could afford to get those lots of things with 
00:04:18	00:04:22	2	okay for four months we'll go and buy refrigerator so for four months
