00:01:12	00:01:19	2	it's about eight hours i think or six hours when you when you take the train and the boat and it's only three hours when you just 
00:01:19	00:01:20	1	oh okay that's 
00:01:20	00:01:23	2	sure yeah it was really good 
00:01:23	00:01:24	1	it's a terrible 
00:01:24	00:01:27	2	[laughter] yeah i mean it definitely makes it a lot more 
00:01:27	00:01:28	1	football and 
00:01:29	00:01:34	1	easy to get to know you talk to tina uh-huh 
00:01:34	00:01:46	2	tina at safeway uh-huh the day before oh sara was to leave to go back east and then and she was saying that sarah hadn't decided that she was probably going to decide tonight and talk 
00:01:46	00:01:47	1	yeah yeah 
00:01:47	00:01:50	2	so that was and then i called her um 
00:01:51	00:01:57	1	you know a few days later like uh-huh four days later or something and she told me that uh-huh move back into 
00:01:57	00:01:59	2	right right yeah 
00:01:59	00:02:02	1	kind of a shocker 'cause yeah i thought that you had had 
00:02:02	00:02:10	2	yes well i did too i mean yeah it's i didn't commitment forever but i did yeah know what i understand i guess 
00:02:10	00:02:11	1	yeah so 
00:02:11	00:02:13	2	whenever i had already told me 
00:02:17	00:02:19	1	less than three weeks 
00:02:19	00:02:27	2	um yeah well i know somebody who is looking for a place okay um 
00:02:31	00:02:31	2	uh-huh 
00:02:31	00:02:34	1	but i would definitely want you guys to meet with her 
00:02:34	00:02:40	2	yeah that's the thing i'm concerned with is whether brian will be right i mean you know you're not you weren't comfortable with me 
00:02:40	00:02:42	1	right 
00:02:42	00:02:49	2	that's fine and the thing is now you know i mean brian is pretty easy yeah 
00:02:49	00:02:50	1	but nonetheless 
00:02:51	00:02:55	1	i guess it's hopefully it'll be comfortable for him 
00:02:55	00:03:02	2	mm yeah well i have a lot of i mean i i don't know i have a lot of really bad feelings about the whole 
00:03:02	00:03:03	1	thing 
00:03:03	00:03:13	2	because i feel bad i mean not bad resentment but like well there's a little of that too but i feel badly because i feel like you know it was at my aunt's 
00:03:13	00:03:20	1	and that you kicked him out essentially and then the uh but at the same time i couldn't really control us because i 
00:03:20	00:03:27	2	just doesn't mean that was your your feeling and i think that's that's the bottom line is that you meant well and you i mean you mean 
00:03:27	00:03:28	1	you know 
00:03:28	00:03:29	2	mhm 
00:03:29	00:03:31	2	yeah you weren't being malicious or anything 
00:03:31	00:03:31	1	you mean 
00:03:35	00:03:37	1	turned into kind of uh 
00:03:38	00:03:40	1	it would have been easiest if i just moved in your place 
00:03:40	00:03:45	2	yeah i guess so [laughter] shit or what it could uh 
00:03:45	00:03:47	1	exactly i mean to deal with 
00:03:47	00:03:49	1	yeah well

00:04:59	00:05:06	2	well i don't know if it means conservative necessarily but more conventional shall we say okay i mean heterosexuality fairly conventional 
00:05:06	00:05:08	1	uh-huh 
00:05:08	00:05:14	2	[noise] some ninety percent of the population seems to practice it or something like that anyway

00:07:47	00:07:49	1	well i mean if he wants to stay also

00:08:00	00:08:06	1	i guess i just feel like i have to make you know whatever that i have to 
00:08:06	00:08:08	1	to suck it up now because 
00:08:08	00:08:12	2	well you have to live with the you know your decision i mean obviously 
00:08:12	00:08:13	1	but that's 
00:08:13	00:08:15	2	it shouldn't be hard i mean that should be 
00:08:16	00:08:17	2	you know 
00:08:17	00:08:22	2	you have to be fair to yourself that was the way he felt and yeah and i mean 
00:08:22	00:08:24	1	but like i kind of a dry 
00:08:24	00:08:26	2	you know the whole thing is kind of uh 
00:08:26	00:08:28	1	i guess i'm trying to apologize 
00:08:28	00:08:30	2	[noise] well i mean it 
00:08:31	00:08:33	1	when you 
00:08:33	00:08:37	2	yeah i don't know what to say at this point about it 
00:08:38	00:08:40	1	you know with anything i'm just 
00:08:40	00:08:44	2	i'm sorry yeah i mean in a way i am 
00:08:44	00:08:46	1	i'm torn between i'm sorry 
00:08:46	00:08:48	2	it's worked out the way it has and 
00:08:48	00:08:54	2	but at the same time i i do kinda feel like i would really made a lot of sacrifices about this new 
00:08:54	00:08:57	1	and that it's been 
00:08:57	00:08:58	2	you know 
00:08:59	00:09:01	2	hard on me and a lot of their own way 
00:09:01	00:09:08	1	you were moving in um you know me you're moving out of the country shortly i mean there was a lot going on 
00:09:08	00:09:12	2	and i also feel really pressure to accept that house because 
00:09:12	00:09:16	2	[noise] that's one time limits that were operating you know 
00:09:16	00:09:19	1	there's there's something wrong with the place 
00:09:19	00:09:21	2	well it's too expensive [laughter] basically 
00:09:26	00:09:28	2	well anyway 
00:09:28	00:09:28	1	mhm

00:10:03	00:10:07	2	well i don't i just think l._a.'s a possibility 
00:10:07	00:10:09	1	i mean that's uh 
00:10:09	00:10:11	1	wild card but if

00:11:16	00:11:17	1	you know i guess 
00:11:17	00:11:19	2	i just have to suffer the consequences

00:11:30	00:11:36	2	i mean whatever basically sarah told me one thing and did something else 
00:11:36	00:11:38	1	yeah that's not right 
00:11:38	00:11:39	1	and what was it 
00:11:39	00:11:43	2	no [laughter] and i mean i'm angry about it but whatever 
00:11:43	00:11:45	1	i can't do anything about it we'll just 
00:11:45	00:11:49	2	you know i mean yeah exactly it's not going to 
00:11:49	00:11:50	1	well um 
00:11:50	00:11:52	2	the cars number 
00:11:52	00:11:54	1	oh you have

00:12:05	00:12:08	1	yeah but you're calling ellie 
00:12:08	00:12:09	2	yeah 
00:12:09	00:12:12	1	and i don't know if she'll remember who you are not so 
00:12:12	00:12:17	2	well hopefully she knows yeah yeah she knows you that 
00:12:18	00:12:20	1	yeah 
00:12:20	00:12:24	2	and then i mean you can whatever she's interested she can come over and 
00:12:25	00:12:27	1	<unk> guys or whatever 
00:12:27	00:12:29	2	right yeah 
00:12:29	00:12:30	1	um 
00:12:30	00:12:40	2	i mean i assuming is already he said he found a place and it sounds like he's already committed to he said that he's going to move in there so i don't want to tell them something now and have them 
00:12:40	00:12:44	1	say something different to the people he's given a commitment you know 
00:12:44	00:12:49	2	well i mean he's under no obligation if you tell him like well actually this girl bag 
00:12:49	00:12:51	1	[laughter] 
00:12:51	00:12:51	2	[laughter] 
00:12:51	00:12:53	1	well it was more i thought that 
00:12:53	00:12:55	2	just whether you were comfortable with them 
00:12:56	00:12:59	1	and it was with whether whether or not we had somebody 
00:12:59	00:13:07	2	yeah i mean that was the original issue right but i guess i'm trying to say that i 
00:13:07	00:13:10	1	and they give it a chance at this point 
00:13:10	00:13:13	2	i just feel like 
00:13:13	00:13:16	1	i don't have any rights left [laughter] 
00:13:16	00:13:19	2	but i kinda used up my 
00:13:20	00:13:21	1	you never 
00:13:21	00:13:21	2	yeah 
00:13:23	00:13:24	2	well i hope you don't feel like you were 
00:13:27	00:13:28	1	forced into any 
00:13:30	00:13:30	2	mhm 
00:13:32	00:13:32	2	mhm 
00:13:33	00:13:35	1	you know feelings 
00:13:35	00:13:35	2	mhm 
00:13:36	00:13:40	2	wow yeah not really sure what that means [laughter] 
00:13:40	00:13:42	1	well i mean i hope you weren't you know 
00:13:43	00:13:46	1	you know your mind wasn't like made up for you 
00:13:46	00:13:49	2	wasn't a little bit to a certain extent yeah 
00:13:51	00:13:52	1	because 
00:13:52	00:13:59	2	you know and nobody's fault really it was just bad really abysmal timing you know 
00:14:00	00:14:01	1	and 
00:14:02	00:14:07	2	i [noise] whatever [laughter] i mean i guess they should happen 
00:14:07	00:14:09	1	yeah 
00:14:09	00:14:10	2	mhm 
00:14:11	00:14:12	1	but 
00:14:12	00:14:13	2	right 
00:14:14	00:14:20	2	it's really frustrating here because i have no control over it too [laughter] you know so like 
00:14:20	00:14:22	1	makes it equally 
00:14:22	00:14:25	2	and then er <unk> to think that 
00:14:25	00:14:30	1	whatever that it had been all wrapped up and everything was solved and then have 
00:14:40	00:14:42	1	the place 
00:14:42	00:14:48	2	well she did though 'cause later she was like oh i'm really sorry i hope i didn't mess things up for you [laughter] and it was like wow 
00:14:48	00:14:48	1	mhm 
00:14:50	00:14:51	2	right 
00:14:52	00:14:55	2	yeah i mean we may not have somebody renting it right away 
00:14:58	00:15:00	2	uh-huh 
00:15:00	00:15:00	1	mhm 
00:15:01	00:15:02	1	i mean 
00:15:03	00:15:04	1	i guess i can ask 
00:15:04	00:15:05	2	parents for money 
00:15:06	00:15:07	1	make up for 
00:15:07	00:15:08	2	mhm 
00:15:09	00:15:10	1	or since
