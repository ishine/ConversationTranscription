00:00:00	00:00:05	2	[noise] okay um i personally don't know a whole lot um i'm twenty one years old and i don't have any children 
00:00:05	00:00:07	1	you don't have any children 
00:00:23	00:00:27	2	to find good daycare is when your babies very young 
00:00:27	00:00:29	1	oh really um 
00:00:29	00:00:42	2	because they can't tell you what's going on the worst experience i had was when i was working when my um [noise] oldest child was a baby and i thought and i just i use the lady next door 
00:00:42	00:00:45	1	to me and you know it was close 
00:00:45	00:00:56	2	and it was convenient and he always came home clean and what have you but i discovered that her way of handling conflicts between little kids once they started crawling and stuff it's very different 
00:00:56	00:00:58	1	what i want it 
00:00:58	00:01:02	2	my son she always interfered and i understand that when you have uh 
00:01:02	00:01:04	1	um 
00:01:04	00:01:11	2	[noise] you know when you have a bunch of kids and you have to make sure that they're all taken care of and everything else you can't let things escalate 
00:01:19	00:01:22	2	oh wow and i i you know and i didn't discover that until 
00:01:25	00:01:37	2	quit working anyway but i decided that actually that the hardest time to find good daycares up to eighteen months old maybe from six weeks to six months you can do but once your baby starts crying and stuff and then until they really start 
00:01:37	00:01:38	1	okay 
00:01:38	00:01:46	2	it's i i find that's the hardest time <unk> how old are your children right now they're seven five and three oh wow 
00:01:46	00:01:47	1	yeah 
00:01:47	00:01:55	2	so but then once every two months old you can often find good preschool kinds of situations mhm but i think it's real 
00:01:55	00:01:57	1	pour it into a check 
00:01:57	00:02:04	2	how you want social interactions handle and how the school or daycare does it 
00:02:05	00:02:11	2	the other things to check they always tell you you know check to make sure that there's continuity of care that your child is going to 
00:02:15	00:02:19	2	right what other kinds of things have you used have you ever do use like a daycare 
00:02:19	00:02:23	1	well i use something sort of like a daycare center 
00:02:23	00:02:24	2	um 
00:02:24	00:02:27	1	for my youngest one when i went back to school 
00:02:27	00:02:28	2	mhm 
00:02:28	00:02:32	1	and it was something that was partially funded by the school 
00:02:32	00:02:35	2	and it was outta y._w._c._a. 
00:02:35	00:02:40	1	and that was pretty good the biggest problem i had there actually was 
00:02:41	00:02:43	1	they've tried to 
00:02:43	00:02:57	2	continuity of care but they kept changing the number of people that were in the program yeah people drop out of school and so the kids would drop out of the program and the <unk> and so and somebody would get sick and they'd start shifting people around from one room to the next 
00:03:10	00:03:12	1	wow but he 
00:03:12	00:03:22	2	he adjusted to it pretty well but that that was tough on him and they they did their best not to do that it's just that you know they kept happening 
00:03:22	00:03:23	1	um 
00:03:23	00:03:24	2	mhm mhm 
00:03:32	00:03:35	2	care that became um much 
00:03:35	00:03:36	1	an issue with uh 
00:03:36	00:03:43	2	yeah well see what it sounds like the most important issues the continuity <unk> well you mean when you say that 
00:03:43	00:03:52	1	other words they should have the same person taking care of oh i see okay the same face the same and see different people even you know 
00:04:03	00:04:06	2	individual applies that philosophy in the same 
00:04:06	00:04:08	1	right that makes sense 
00:04:08	00:04:20	2	so it's nice for kids to have a chance to get used to how things are going to happen so that they <unk> and they have a chance they can start learning to predict a little 
00:04:20	00:04:21	1	but i know real little ones 
00:04:21	00:04:31	2	do very much predicting but they should have a chance to say i guess okay i'm going to get there and this is going to happen and this is going to happen and if i do this 
00:04:31	00:04:32	1	[laughter] 
00:04:32	00:04:37	2	that's going to happen you know they should have a way to be able to predict what's gonna happen to them 
00:04:37	00:04:39	1	and um if you 
00:04:48	00:04:49	1	<unk> mhm 
00:04:49	00:04:58	2	um yeah and then different children to have different different ways of handling it one thing i think that parents really
