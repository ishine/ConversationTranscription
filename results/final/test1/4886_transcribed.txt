00:05:59	00:06:02	1	but uh whatever they moved so now we we go to the <unk> 
00:06:09	00:06:10	1	yeah 
00:06:10	00:06:10	2	anyway 
00:06:10	00:06:12	1	yeah yeah and 
00:06:12	00:06:14	2	um so how's your new place gone

00:06:16	00:06:20	2	yeah what are you plug will be surprised or otherwise well 
00:06:30	00:06:42	2	trust is way to face is laid out in the smarter use of her face and it's really like nicely laid out and it's very like uh i don't know if <unk> luxurious 
00:06:42	00:06:44	1	<unk> i mean you're the one that's 
00:06:52	00:06:55	1	i'm very happy with that with the house 
00:06:55	00:07:05	2	i'm very happy with the people the people are really young people are very very wonderful legendary people and yeah it's very good like just like when i'm sick you know i get a faith 
00:07:09	00:07:17	2	mean tell we're really really busting out of our apartment like <unk> it's a one bedroom apartment then and then when i fell asleep in the living room right we're reluctant to leave 
00:07:17	00:07:19	1	cause we have such good neighbors 
00:07:19	00:07:21	2	so close you know we've been together already three four years 
00:07:21	00:07:23	1	right right you know they're all 
00:07:23	00:07:29	2	basically became at the same time and they're very very good friends we ever need a babysitter and you have to run somewhere we need a car 
00:07:29	00:07:31	1	you know it's it's it's 
00:07:37	00:07:39	1	[laughter] she was [noise] 
00:07:39	00:07:47	2	she thought that was a master's come again this will help us that's really the only things so but that's uh 
00:07:47	00:07:56	1	no i said oh my oh mom i remember <unk> round oh i'll try to be best friends with his brown oh really 
00:07:56	00:08:15	2	because if she wants to make sure that they're not just come again she's gonna she'll take care of us [laughter] no they live like that these people know wow but that's something else i mean we're like yeah whatever [laughter] you don't think about being protected allowed at all no but just like in terms of communal stuff is very nice thing about family 
00:08:15	00:08:16	1	very very important 
00:08:16	00:08:17	2	that's fantastic 
00:08:17	00:08:23	1	so that's very good and the kids are mama shouldn't have and it's like it's heaven for kids they run outside 
00:08:49	00:08:51	1	do something else 
00:08:51	00:09:02	2	but it's still like he he has freedom like you know if i'm just stay on the street and i just watching me runs back and forth of his little cars or or you know whatever <unk> or something so he 
00:09:02	00:09:13	1	you know but <unk> in terms of naturally like <unk> it's really a good life for kids it's it's really really good very healthy life for them like they're very very happy 
00:09:13	00:09:16	2	and um there's probably only one that suffers little from it 
00:09:50	00:09:52	2	not so much now 
00:09:52	00:10:00	1	so uh you know i have to start looking into supplementing in looking into like teaching these eighteen year old programs 'cause like they're the only ones that pay anything 'cause you know 
00:10:15	00:10:22	1	right right so that that's big enough to do even though it's not as kids aren't as motivated by any means right but uh but 
00:10:22	00:10:24	2	in terms of pure cash 
00:10:24	00:10:29	1	well that's the bottom line right at the bottom line if you don't have what the 
00:10:29	00:10:38	2	right exactly so it's a it's a bit of a it's a problem now though because of it i uh you know it's like the year everybody started then i have to try and do like you know turn it either 
00:10:38	00:10:41	1	even then or things like that like you know 
00:10:57	00:10:59	2	right or like generally 
00:10:59	00:11:01	1	many people in the <unk> 
00:11:01	00:11:05	2	<unk> you know here that are qualified 
00:11:05	00:11:07	1	yeah so 
00:11:07	00:11:19	2	it's hard to it's hard to get a job like unless you have a reputation or you you know somebody <unk> you know [noise] so uh so i anyway the only way to like penetrated it's like with a with a connection and then with like 
00:11:19	00:11:23	1	proving yourself like you know if you do on maternity leave or whatever it is 
00:11:23	00:11:39	2	right and they'll hire you for the next year you know uh-huh so like <unk> and started uh uh seminary oh really yeah um let's see like like miss la la but with more <unk> uh-huh so um 
00:11:39	00:11:42	1	you mean finally to the right of <unk> just a little different do once 
00:11:42	00:11:48	2	um i don't know if it's to the <unk> i would say to the right amount a lot but it's like has more of a direction like you know look a certain 
00:11:48	00:11:49	1	uh uh-huh 
00:11:49	00:11:58	2	ooh that sounds a lot there's like you know just a collection of teachers this one is like more of a you know more like a lead more like homogeneous 
00:11:58	00:11:59	1	i see so 
00:11:59	00:12:09	2	but at the same kind of style place but um so i have a friend who's uh who's teaching there and i'm gonna try and like you know smoke next to get on me and you never know 
00:12:09	00:12:11	1	'cause like the truth 
00:12:11	00:12:18	2	is is that i taught one year and a seminary here <unk> like the girls weren't the best not to be one of the best 
00:12:18	00:12:21	1	right it's like you know like all these like girls 
00:12:36	00:12:40	2	kinds of stuff i mean there are mentally coming for the year vacation in israel not really 
00:12:53	00:12:55	1	<unk> or like a <unk> 
00:12:55	00:13:04	2	but people are already come you know like uh more motivated to learn so that is the way half of the problem you know so um 
00:13:04	00:13:07	1	so yeah i guess you gotta try that you know 
00:13:28	00:13:37	2	yeah i'm very expensive here they kill us ridiculous like pieces of junk junk 
00:13:37	00:13:41	1	unbelievable the million dollars i don't know why it's furniture so expensive there maybe <unk> 
00:13:41	00:13:49	2	i don't know market now it's it's made impressive what are we talking about <unk> <unk> it's garbage guard we got her a garbage for the <unk> you pay nothing for it 
00:13:49	00:13:55	1	because because it's not produce right here this small market is so small 
00:13:55	00:14:01	2	that uh yeah that you can't produce in the same volume so you know you have to charge more 
00:14:01	00:14:02	1	i see so 
00:14:02	00:14:13	2	ah but in any case whatever i guy i was going to make sure i'm like all the time to try and look for these in these in these liking hand stores you know like i did i bought one things 
00:14:13	00:14:14	1	even though that's offensive 
00:14:14	00:14:20	2	yeah so i got one for four hundred <unk> two hundred dollars <unk> it's not so bad 
00:14:20	00:14:22	1	but uh but uh i i 
00:14:43	00:14:45	1	it was all over right 
00:14:56	00:14:57	1	here in oregon 
00:14:57	00:15:04	2	um i was um how how is danny having enough for her at all and then his thing 
00:15:04	00:15:13	1	having a very very hard time with my son 'cause um well like i don't know it's uh i don't know if it's like <unk> it's a whole combination of things like 
00:15:13	00:15:17	2	he's a viable product or he or he doesn't i think 
00:15:17	00:15:23	1	product ah there's a few things i think he has a viable product but i think that he's not like a fun 
00:15:23	00:15:26	2	razor organizer type um 
00:15:26	00:15:29	1	like from the beginning if he had had a person 
00:15:29	00:15:40	2	that was like back uh type with him then they would have been okay but like the truth is is that all the people that worked with them initially were like <unk> like you know or like danny 
00:15:40	00:15:42	1	uh sort of uh uh uh you mean 
00:15:42	00:15:49	2	no yeah acted creative and all that but not like the battle practical down to earth ah you know money money and like 
00:15:49	00:15:53	1	you know maybe get mad at higher money minded guy for this 
00:15:53	00:15:54	2	you know what i mean yes 
00:15:54	00:16:01	1	the problem is beyond like indoor so beyond that financially now that they can't hire anybody so uh 
00:16:01	00:16:07	2	you'll have to you'll have to so to speak er raises own salary i mean well that's yeah 
00:16:21	00:16:25	2	oh you almost have to follow up is one of the things you know 
00:16:51	00:16:53	1	very very 
00:16:53	00:17:00	2	so he's he's struggling like crazy and uh you know then on top of it he's like he's in the middle of nowhere here stranded 
00:17:00	00:17:02	1	uh we thought that it was every <unk> 
00:17:02	00:17:20	2	so we're we're right in your carry it safer it's still like everybody's telling us at the buses periods safer go out every half hour and you know more and more service but it's like every half hour during rush hour like eight and five but [noise] for like three for an hour or two at a time like but you know that you can <unk> the day where like for three hours is no but 
00:17:20	00:17:22	1	so it can be real pain 
00:17:33	00:17:44	2	and then yeah and then like if you're old then doesn't have to get the truth is danny you know is in town so it's not such a big deal to get from glued to the town but for me like it's like to get for oh fast 
00:17:44	00:17:47	1	that you have to take it because 
00:17:47	00:17:50	2	yeah and then next it's like an hour and a half you know just 
00:17:50	00:17:51	1	uh-huh oh 
00:17:51	00:18:04	2	uh so that's a real and they also have to go and walked into curious safer like it's also walk like a fifteen twenty minute walk in the blistering son [noise] so uh as far as that goes commuting goes it's really 
00:18:04	00:18:08	1	goes it's not easy like now i'm trying to get uh there's also the beginning you don't know 
00:18:08	00:18:14	2	yeah i guess you are going to a few months you life will take on some some some routine it'll <unk> things will get easier because 
00:18:14	00:18:19	1	like what you have to do you have to be in the know like you have to find out about you know who goes 
00:18:19	00:18:21	2	then go in and then transfer 
00:18:21	00:18:35	1	yeah so i've just found out or a ride that goes with like seven ten in the morning like i can get to work with it so you know and danny found something like three times a week uh like a ride in at the time that he needs to get like so i think with time a lot 
00:18:35	00:18:40	2	<unk> will be able to hide out some of the kings right right [laughter] 
00:18:40	00:18:42	1	[noise] just a you know until then it's 
00:18:42	00:18:55	2	ah it's crazy a little bit so uh yeah so man like you know there's a lot of things stupid things like there's no screens on the windows and it's such a full of <unk> 
00:18:55	00:19:01	1	and probably to buy strings costs so much yeah and then yeah to make you know you have to make their looming in for the whole 
00:19:01	00:19:04	2	like i i haven't gotten a call yet i'm 
00:19:04	00:19:06	1	sort of afraid to 
00:19:06	00:19:12	2	but like danny goes crazy with these things he hates dogs and whatever you know like he bought some screen up and 
00:19:19	00:19:27	1	logistical things that hopefully with time we'll get are now but at this point there though they drive you crazy <unk> here like we're um we're very 
00:19:27	00:19:30	2	what's that humid human dry 
00:19:30	00:19:31	1	hot and 
00:19:31	00:19:39	2	<unk> that's for sure that's for sure not conditions like eight thousand <unk> uh yeah 
00:19:39	00:19:42	1	that makes sense a thousand <unk> watch a thousand <unk> 
00:19:42	00:19:47	2	yeah what's the one that's uh three thousand dollars right american 
00:19:47	00:19:50	1	yeah it did they have a system second go heating or air conditioning 
00:19:50	00:19:59	2	yeah well you're also i'm saying but we can you can get here wall unit for ah for four hundred dollars right well i didn't hear i mean 
00:20:05	00:20:08	1	important i haven't even here in like in <unk> pardon me 
00:20:08	00:20:10	2	yeah that makes a difference 
00:20:10	00:20:16	1	we have a <unk> but it's a shock air conditioner so together this female sign a cool place 
00:20:16	00:20:17	2	right right oh yeah 
00:20:17	00:20:19	1	if it was summer here oh you're in trouble you know 
00:20:19	00:20:23	2	like right but i've never been in like what is worse like it's worse 
00:20:23	00:20:27	1	right really hot yeah it's humid right 
00:20:27	00:20:44	2	hi [laughter] so it's funny <unk> i never liked the fan didn't really make the make a different job but they're dry here but like with with wet here it really made a fan really does make it really makes 
00:20:44	00:20:47	1	it's so <unk> you know it's it's 
00:20:47	00:20:55	2	would be a nice enough to <unk> totally totally without the fan we couldn't sleep and then <unk> like didn't want the windows open 
00:20:55	00:20:56	1	the kinds of bugs over and then 
00:20:56	00:21:03	2	the trees <unk> closing in so the sun was <unk> it was like <unk> and when it came in a <unk> seemed like it was 
00:21:03	00:21:06	1	awful the first few days are awful awful 
00:21:06	00:21:14	2	but ah yeah we have <unk> so we're trying to get set up with the fans and stuff but ah you know like until you get anything done they send us the wrong parts 
00:21:14	00:21:16	1	it's hard you know 
00:21:16	00:21:19	2	<unk> and then we have another friend that 
00:21:25	00:21:32	1	so whatever until it gets i figure not like until the hugging him it's not going to be like that it's not going to be to 
00:21:50	00:21:56	2	that's life it's it's gone on i'm not really worth it to six foot of dover right so you have to know by
