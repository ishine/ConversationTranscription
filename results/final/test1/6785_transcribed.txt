00:10:20	00:10:22	1	isn't that a credible 
00:10:22	00:10:28	2	yeah i got i got my son you know my i bought a mobile home my son was supposed to pay me for slowly over the years 
00:10:28	00:10:30	1	and then he went to school full time 
00:10:30	00:10:37	2	which we weren't expecting and so he hasn't been paying me for the mobile home but mhm half the time 
00:10:37	00:10:40	1	and living there either it's been staying with the friend finally he's living there 
00:10:40	00:10:47	2	[noise] and i went up to help them with the plumbing on it and they you know we worked on it somebody hit
