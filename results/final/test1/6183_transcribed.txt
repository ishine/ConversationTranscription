00:03:08	00:03:18	2	people don't really have a warning for these things and i have on my refrigerator this scripture about teaching us to number our days it's from some ninety i don't know if you can remember that but you know ninety i always thought gee 
00:03:18	00:03:20	1	yeah 
00:03:20	00:03:27	2	live to be ninety you know that's old that my poor mom is only sixty five i thought wow you know i'm going to inherit half of her genetic 
00:03:27	00:03:27	1	[laughter] 
00:03:27	00:03:38	2	that you're on so that made me um effective the fifteenth i'm no longer in the active reserves you know the the rumor in my unit was we were going to get called up on the eighteenth anyway and i thought oh i can't live with that 
00:03:54	00:03:55	1	uh-huh 
00:03:58	00:04:00	1	schools and the way our older people are treated him 
00:04:00	00:04:01	2	oh i 
00:04:01	00:04:05	1	i don't think our country should spend what did they say no six billion over there and 
00:04:05	00:04:11	2	oh really oh maybe it's just two billion i get the billions confused with a number of land mines and how much 
00:04:11	00:04:14	1	but um 
00:04:14	00:04:20	2	still be like a call up list if they need a dietitian but oh my goodness you know <unk> i'm not gonna 
00:04:20	00:04:30	1	you know sure my responsibility you're certainly not going to go really i thought too many body bags coming back when i was in high school twenty years ago and you know it is a cycle the world is on a site 
00:04:30	00:04:33	2	<unk> yeah <unk> 
00:04:33	00:04:37	1	yeah i didn't want to get off the topic but i'll tell your husband i said you know high 
00:04:47	00:04:49	1	<unk> 
00:04:49	00:04:58	2	yeah loves the cat in the hat and i'm the lifetime handle this morning there was a special with <unk> beach about toddler play time [noise] water okay 
00:04:58	00:05:00	1	um <unk> 
00:05:00	00:05:07	2	<unk> time don't fit the children into your idea of play they have more fun with just you know the boxes and 
00:05:07	00:05:14	1	so really i i've been up to adjusting pretty well all of this but i tell you i don't know how people do that years and years ago when they had like seven 
00:05:14	00:05:29	2	<unk> oh i had three it yeah i know at home you know cleaning demise goats but i enjoyed it looking back on it was very frustrating in a way if there was anything else you wanted to do like even if you wanted to go into the library 
00:05:29	00:05:32	1	wish i had to dress 
00:05:32	00:05:36	2	three children uh well you know to my mom even has a 
00:05:36	00:05:40	1	friend that came to visit her that was part of a family of she said either twenty or twenty one i said 
00:06:03	00:06:05	1	i don't know about the money end of it no no 
00:06:05	00:06:10	2	that is good but i was only handling the budgets and knowing how much yeah russian is 
00:06:10	00:06:11	1	it's it's a little more 
00:06:11	00:06:26	2	yeah it's a lot more analytical yeah i think like dealing with the average person with their distress over what they're getting on their trays i mean a lot of times you know even after i have a thing on quito jenny diet i mean to send to you too and that but even after all these years that's pretty much what we were 
00:06:26	00:06:28	1	still doing 
00:06:41	00:06:46	2	this will be the happiest time with the children in my opinion you know and you'll look back and be very glad 
00:06:46	00:06:55	1	well it it truly this damage generation though 'cause like each day she learn something new and now my mom is pretty much so limited and it's so hard to see this but i can do that 
00:06:55	00:06:59	2	she brings her so that makes me feel heavy but a really hard to see one person that you 
00:06:59	00:07:07	1	love so much you know what kind of check out and then you know starting to learn how to love this other one that gosh i have such a responsibility now [laughter] 
00:07:07	00:07:23	2	how's your husband adjusting to him that he had this you know how men are their lives don't change all that much i mean true it'll doing his volunteer firefighter thing and he's having a lot of carbon monoxide alarm's going off now oh he's making all kinds of extra runs and he's 
00:07:23	00:07:25	1	oh happy about that but 
00:07:25	00:07:28	2	and of course he has all the relatives here in town so there's that 
00:07:31	00:07:48	2	okay and that he um is you know catholic and a lot more schedule than i am i more inner denominational and [laughter] i don't remember all these special days i mean he goes to church all the time now this let's see what was it on friday it with something and i thought oh you gotta be kidding me starting already 
00:07:48	00:07:55	1	terrible i oh you in a catholic but for god and it was december he does something special 
00:07:55	00:08:07	2	me and my mother in law she i'm never gonna get caught i keep thinking too he's the eldest son so someday we're going to be responsible for all the great blankets and i know this is long distance but sometimes you got to ask me to tell me tell you my grave blankets 
00:08:07	00:08:09	1	story but i mean 
00:08:09	00:08:27	2	oh there is so cute he he buys all these gray's lake it's you know for all the different relatives that are here and then he takes 'em all around well then the whoever the cemetery officials says oh you can't do that yet it's not you know officially the time and it was in the catholic weekly or something when mr correctly you know this is the guy that was the nazis for eleven months and he 
00:08:46	00:08:51	1	poke the over his head so then we agree on the other prisoners knew the nazi's were never going to kill 'em they were just going to 
00:08:51	00:08:54	2	make them feel uncomfortable sure yes 
00:09:04	00:09:06	1	[laughter] 
00:09:06	00:09:20	2	she loves the show and i just she kinda got one of those funny voices you know i think i hope this is really positive for childhood he certainly has no captain kangaroo you know you don't even have a dinosaurs anymore 
00:09:20	00:09:21	1	well my 
00:09:21	00:09:31	2	grandchildren went through the barney phase will the too old i have three grandchildren uh-huh and uh after a time i couldn't stand to see anything purple that was 
00:09:31	00:09:35	1	and i thought oh well i got her a burning for christmas

00:11:06	00:11:10	2	i love churches and painting they're probably gonna yeah is it something about how we 
00:11:10	00:11:12	1	you know like how we know each other 
00:11:12	00:11:27	2	probably is something about i'm not sure if it's about accent endurance oh really now i grew up in pennsylvania you grew up in michigan oh okay yeah right well what kind of like sisters though you know when you think about the long term effect of all 
00:11:27	00:11:28	1	uh-huh 
00:11:28	00:11:46	2	life you know we're just lucky in america that we do have regional um differences but enough of our common themes i think our country can always pull together but what happened over there i don't understand it it's like the <unk> you know family's just you know oh this is hideous really i 
00:11:46	00:11:47	1	just can't imagine 
00:11:47	00:11:54	2	yeah one one group wants to dominate i think at regardless of the cost of <unk> 
00:11:54	00:12:01	1	uh like my mother was very positive you know go do things you know learn new things and i don't know if i can bring colleen up with that kind of 
00:12:01	00:12:09	2	um positive well i hope i can and i will try but due on one you know there's a lot of really strange people in the world 
00:12:09	00:12:11	1	oh let's see now that i know 
00:12:11	00:12:14	2	oh yeah it's like you know i don't watch these shows 
00:12:14	00:12:18	1	like current affairs and all this but it it every once in a while one you can't help it somebody else

00:15:13	00:15:20	2	shelley those personnel people always changed hands too and it was kind of hard to find who to talk to 
00:15:20	00:15:30	1	yeah i think they will be going down to human resources heated this week early next week just simply to lay it on the table and to say look 
00:15:30	00:15:37	2	we just don't feel that you know we are geared to do one particular thing and we're willing to do certain other things

00:21:11	00:21:20	2	terrible waste of american people may maybe it'll work out and we hope that it was going to be a good thing but i'd never going to the case of blind ambition on the part of the president 
00:21:20	00:21:25	1	oh i haven't given it too much thought i probably should but i know you always think these things
