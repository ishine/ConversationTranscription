00:00:00	00:00:01	1	okay 
00:00:01	00:00:05	2	okay all right we're there that's it [laughter] 
00:00:11	00:00:15	1	so tell me exactly what are they going to do with this wonderful recording 
00:00:15	00:00:20	2	well the the deal is uh this friend of mine <unk> is a uh computer science research or 
00:00:20	00:00:23	1	in the area of natural languages and so 
00:00:23	00:00:28	2	there's this research project that he is participating in and and you know others 
00:00:28	00:00:30	1	you know around the country are doing 
00:00:30	00:00:46	2	and what they're doing is they're digitizing telephone conversations and they're going to try and extract as many samples of words spoken over a telephone as they can basically individual words they're probably not going to be transmitted the whole message in its entirety ever um because 
00:00:46	00:00:47	1	you know what for 
00:00:47	00:00:49	2	so the ideas too 
00:00:49	00:00:52	1	get a whole giant listing of the different ways that 
00:00:52	00:00:53	2	can say the word to say 
00:00:53	00:00:57	1	ah execute the president of the united states for instance 
00:00:57	00:01:02	2	the contract that kind of controversial emery [laughter] 
00:01:02	00:01:04	1	[laughter] okay 
00:01:04	00:01:15	2	oh so then they could they could just pick out and see like the difference in like the tone like through through digital <unk> yeah <unk> exactly magic right oh yeah well that's very interesting 
00:01:27	00:01:28	1	right 
00:01:28	00:01:34	2	um so yeah you can call um you know out of the country and within the united states 
00:01:34	00:01:37	1	and let me ask you something like 'cause my brother get into this program 
00:01:37	00:01:40	2	sure i mean only an hour but yeah sure 
00:01:40	00:01:44	1	oh my god you got to give me information it because this one 
00:01:44	00:01:47	2	<unk> my brother calls me like a fairly frequently 
00:01:47	00:01:50	1	try to keep it to a minimum but i mean 
00:01:50	00:01:54	2	i mean he's a chat face just like you know two hours later 
00:01:54	00:01:57	1	we'd better get off the phone 
00:01:57	00:02:09	2	and uh and then another fifteen minutes of phone conversation so this'll be nice 'cause he's got i mean he calls me and he's also got friends all over the state city closing his phone bills are huge my brother yeah i mean you 
00:02:09	00:02:20	1	no the only thing that having my only got two calls so it's only three calls but i even said that was an hour that's right and international hours i know i know that's quite an expense yeah and it can be anywhere 
00:02:20	00:02:31	2	well too which is pretty wild i mean obviously it will be the span but i mean there are way more expensive places to call them from the u._s. to spain where else are you calling like do you have to go and just the nation 
00:02:31	00:02:33	1	no i mean i'm just calling you 
00:02:33	00:02:41	2	yeah yeah oh lord i especially when you feel special yeah stays on just one second <unk> cause i'm going to lower the music tailed okay okay 
00:02:41	00:02:47	1	okay [laughter] mhm 
00:02:47	00:02:57	2	<unk> well he <unk> music or 
00:02:57	00:03:02	1	hello there you are that aaron the tape [laughter] how's it going good oh wow 
00:03:02	00:03:04	2	uh-huh 
00:03:04	00:03:09	1	i wasn't listening to the boys i came back and they started talking [noise] how are you 
00:03:09	00:03:12	2	okay yeah i'm in one of these like periods of cheese 
00:03:12	00:03:14	1	sucks you know and ah 
00:03:28	00:03:30	1	it was the only good for 
00:03:30	00:03:39	2	six months or so when we were there after school and i mean there are other good parts of the two of course but there were the the hassles at the job there so it's like i just have to kind of reconcile myself to always 
00:03:39	00:03:41	1	hitting work [laughter] 
00:03:41	00:03:44	2	[laughter] yeah i know like you find something that 
00:03:44	00:03:51	1	it isn't stressful or not boring that's the main two combinations right yeah not stressful and not boring 
00:03:51	00:04:05	2	like i have no problem secretarial work okay that would fit into that category because if you're a busy enough secretary you know you you don't get bored 'cause you're always doing something different and if your employers are relatively decent human being you know to <unk> 
00:04:05	00:04:08	1	but you get no respect i'm you know you're a secretary and the pay is pretty 
00:04:08	00:04:12	2	pretty crummy it's about well pretty much the same as as what i'm getting now 
00:04:12	00:04:15	1	you know but um depending upon where 
00:04:15	00:04:26	2	work and all but you know it's like that's no answer either so i've just been toying with this idea of going back to school and getting in computer science degree so i can always be gainfully employed but anyway because at that 
00:04:26	00:04:29	1	he's saying oh yeah that pregnant or anything yeah 
00:04:29	00:04:31	2	maybe that's a new jersey 
00:04:31	00:04:38	1	<unk> yeah i don't know the funny thing is it's like ten years ago i would have said oh yeah that was what i really want to be doing having a baby 
00:04:38	00:04:40	2	but like at this point in time it's kind of like we're going to do 
00:04:40	00:04:42	1	because if we don't do it 
00:04:42	00:04:44	2	uh you know when the next year to weed regret it 
00:04:44	00:04:49	1	you know we we figured something we'd want to do it's not like we're doing and we have to do it or there's peer pressure or um 
00:04:49	00:04:58	2	oh no no no i i know exactly where you're at because i think about that too i already got about like six or seven years yeah i figure my body is a very slow um 
00:04:58	00:05:00	1	mature 
00:05:00	00:05:03	2	like i get my period was sixteen i don't look i mean i look like about 
00:05:03	00:05:08	1	at least five or six years younger than i actually am yeah and i'm just starting to 
00:05:08	00:05:13	2	my period actually now i have an adult so i kinda figured well i must say i i'm probably i'm probably 
00:05:13	00:05:25	1	to at least some time in the early forties and i could probably go a little longer than that i notice a risk and all that bullshit but um yeah i think about that too 'cause it's like i mean i i kinda like the way things are going in there i know total lack of responsibility 
00:05:25	00:05:39	2	kids are cute and all that and i was just we we slip till noon we got up about ten and like oh we have to get up and played with the cats so back to sleep okay i mean we're talking total slackers and i thought gee you know if we had a kid we couldn't do this [laughter] you know 
00:05:39	00:05:46	1	be focused on that and i i mean there's lots of other things that i mean as far as like living situation i would feel kind of settled you know like i might be like 
00:05:46	00:05:51	2	traits them out but i mean i could say that for the next five or even eight or maybe ten years <unk> even if i could 
00:06:08	00:06:10	1	[laughter] 
00:06:31	00:06:34	2	the way things were just asking the question 
00:06:34	00:06:36	1	gee do we really like 
00:06:36	00:06:48	2	um the way things are over here with the lifestyle the nine to five kind of thing i mean i'm really in the nine to five thing more so than he is he you know he should be there by oh let's say eight thirty nine but yeah 
00:06:48	00:06:50	1	well okay 
00:06:50	00:06:54	2	[laughter] and he's professors obviously uh uh a great person to work for so 
00:07:03	00:07:05	1	twelve o'clock and i'm thinking 
00:07:18	00:07:26	2	yea yea yea i mean you have to like look at like both i mean they both have advantages and disadvantages but you have to do was concentrate on the advantages 
00:07:26	00:07:33	1	what other ever place your end mhm and think about the disadvantages of the place that you're not in yeah i wish you'd go nuts right 
00:07:33	00:07:39	2	true yeah i know laura tried to <unk> we have email and and so she sent me a letter back thing 
00:07:39	00:07:49	1	[noise] you know remember how crowded the transportation is and what else how expensive everything is and uh you know i remember those 
00:07:49	00:08:02	2	and you work you know possibilities were a lot more limited room and the language you know yeah constantly like kinda like i mean those could be considered positive things as well yeah but i mean you might as well think of them in a negative rather than 
00:08:02	00:08:04	1	[noise] well all i know 
00:08:04	00:08:10	2	and that's why i i it helps to have kind of a glimpse into the future right and that's how we got to spain 
00:08:10	00:08:13	1	the first places we said we want to live abroad and we would try to do it you know 
00:08:13	00:08:14	2	teachers and it turned out 
00:08:14	00:08:16	1	that way 'cause we had this i 
00:08:16	00:08:20	2	and i really feel that that's important and so when i'm having an idea of now is 
00:08:20	00:08:24	1	okay you know every works on his doctor it takes about five or six 
00:08:24	00:08:39	2	<unk> we have the kid probably we he gets a research positions somewhere in france or in spain um and then we move over there and you know i take care of the kid and and do some you know little day labor or whatever you know we'll see 
00:08:49	00:08:54	1	so subject to whatever change in the weather there happens to be right 
00:08:54	00:09:11	2	and and it's like you know i think about because i get like the same i get the same as you like some days it's just kind of like you know what the hell am i doing that and that was my life but i mean just like what you know like what like where do i get the animal to to just you know to do anything you know they can just lay in bed and dreams i know that easily 
00:09:11	00:09:15	1	i i know i know what you're saying i i feel there's sort of uh 
00:09:19	00:09:31	2	stressing over <unk> for a while a couple of months back there i was thinking in terms of oh gosh you know can we ever afford a house and then we sat down and sort of looked at it financially and said this is what we really want to be worrying about right now 
00:09:31	00:09:32	1	yeah 
00:09:32	00:09:36	2	and and so you know you can sort of focus too much on the future or 
00:09:36	00:09:39	1	i i know i have this tendency to do that 
00:09:39	00:09:47	2	and missed the president <unk> yeah i mean miss like you know the smell of the goddamn onions frying in the pan yeah you know and eat and each little i mean 
00:09:47	00:09:51	1	like as far as i'm concerned there's like no pleasure that's isn't 
00:09:51	00:10:04	2	<unk> is the one that you're experiencing at that moment you know you can think about it was something might be like a reminisce about the past like when you're there in that moment it's i mean everything else just kinda like it's almost like time doesn't exist yeah you know yeah 
00:10:04	00:10:12	1	no one of the best moments i can recall in these past few months is okay i get to late to work a little bit late which is common and they don't really care since i'm an hourly 
00:10:16	00:10:17	1	parked i'm way out there in the <unk> 
00:10:17	00:10:24	2	a lot closer to where the trees are and i you know i close the door i'd just take a deep breath is like okay another day and i hear the birds 
00:10:24	00:10:25	1	yeah 
00:10:25	00:10:40	2	and i just stopped for a minute and listen to the birds and that's that sort of tears me up there i you know i realize wait a minute okay in that nasty sterile office where the windows don't even open um i will be for the next eight hours or so but out here they're still is some life going on and just sort of tears me up 
00:10:43	00:10:49	2	yeah and that moment i mean nobody's going to like interfere with that at all there you are you in the birds you know 
00:10:49	00:10:54	1	yep [noise] hey we can find good spanish wind over here speaking of the moment [laughter] 
00:11:22	00:11:28	1	some visitors and my family's planning on coming this summer so i'll take them there and it's fun to play so i wanted to take them to also 
00:11:28	00:11:32	2	the one over and grass here that i'm on a corner i think i think 
00:11:32	00:11:35	1	couple of places and grassy of that i've been going to 
00:11:35	00:11:49	2	uh-huh but uh there's one in the um <unk> actually it's on the other side of <unk> over by the born now and it's got i've only been there i've only eating their one story but i've been in a million times 'cause every time i pass it some they have to show 
00:11:49	00:11:50	1	the place uh-huh 
00:11:50	00:11:56	2	actually you know i know where i'm going to go there i have a friend my friend from england remember <unk> i told you about <unk> my old um

00:12:14	00:12:22	2	um think that you're you're able to stay that was i was a little bit worried <unk> at first you know back there 'cause the the money would run out probably in april or so 
00:12:22	00:12:27	1	[noise] and i knew you know i knew i'd get a job right and i mean i knew i would get a job but 
00:12:32	00:12:40	1	some i want something i have to get something and i will but i didn't <unk> i i i just thought that you know i'll get a job and at this 
00:12:40	00:12:43	2	if i get desperate i'll just have to take anything and the 
00:12:43	00:12:45	1	that i like kind of fell into something that's 
00:12:45	00:12:47	2	really sweet i mean <unk> in the beginning 
00:12:47	00:12:52	1	everything kind of starts at nights but i'm changing my attitude to the point where i'm not going to get stressed out about too much 
00:12:56	00:12:59	1	good time and i'm not going to 
00:12:59	00:13:06	2	the same either like from working with kids i mean that was like you know my my career for like eight years mhm but this is you know more like 
00:13:06	00:13:08	1	and you nice it's doing well 
00:13:08	00:13:15	2	you can always go back to that if you want it to you know we're in the states where maybe eventually once you have your residency and you could work in some 
00:13:15	00:13:17	1	someplace in spain to with with 
00:13:17	00:13:26	2	yeah i don't have a big draw for it right now if anything like i would like to open a bit i've always wanted to have like a bar or restaurant and he jumped in honey [laughter] like i'd love to 
00:13:26	00:13:28	1	i wanna win win the lottery first 
00:13:36	00:13:44	2	good and and so you're you're probably not going to come back for christmas which is cool and he was telling me that so yeah it makes them it it's too expensive

00:13:46	00:14:02	2	you know do you think or or you know i'm trying to i'm thinking about coming back for christmas what do you think um so i wrote her back like don't do it unless you if you <unk> you know you're coming back next summer which is what she was figuring [noise] to go to school and that kind of thing it's like don't bother <unk> holidays it's just too hectic and too expensive 
00:14:02	00:14:03	1	well or it's going to go back to the states 
00:14:03	00:14:07	2	<unk> yeah she's um this is what she says now it could 
00:14:07	00:14:10	1	of course um and 
00:14:10	00:14:12	2	she's actually she's been together with this guy 
00:14:12	00:14:21	1	ooh i guess for well probably close <unk> close to a year and um he's been unemployed and he might get a job 
00:14:21	00:14:30	2	[noise] making hello hello i'm there and we got some good digital mix up here [noise] when he cordless 
00:14:30	00:14:33	1	<unk> <unk> go to the bedroom and grab the other phone 
00:14:33	00:14:38	2	the uh the stupid part of them i think we need to change the batteries or something 
00:14:38	00:14:41	1	uh perhaps yeah i still haven't been able to get my answering 
00:14:41	00:14:42	2	hooked up no way 
00:14:42	00:14:46	1	yeah you know why why a type of phone that we have 
00:14:46	00:14:49	2	isn't this phone you can hook up the answering machine too because 
00:14:49	00:14:51	1	two lines or something 
00:14:51	00:14:58	2	has it the answering machine has hold onto or or let me say it has the yeah the answering machine oh well yeah the thing is like six

00:15:02	00:15:06	1	right and the jack right and this one has six yeah 
00:15:15	00:15:24	1	hold on the line yeah the problem is that with this business phone sort of deal i mean yeah i mean it's like you don't really have all those individual telephone lines but 
00:15:24	00:15:29	2	they all go through one phone <unk> got an answering machine cooked up in his office yeah 
00:15:29	00:15:30	1	i mean that's the only way to do it 
00:15:30	00:15:37	2	i know you know if i i'm really thinking about i mean like i was thinking about a million different ways to spend my money and uh 
00:15:37	00:15:40	1	i was thinking that he was he was actually suggesting this 
00:15:40	00:15:49	2	like i thought maybe he would like financial like chip in [noise] but um take him taking over the phone bobby yeah [laughter] yeah <unk> him when he's here 
00:15:53	00:15:55	2	[laughter] next time he comes back but um 
00:15:55	00:15:57	1	we have we have a cordless phone which i 
00:15:57	00:16:04	2	and uh the answer was this all i need to raise my phone bill even higher the answering machine right and 
00:16:04	00:16:06	1	and i'm like constantly like heather to this 
00:16:06	00:16:09	2	you know little space here out in the hall 
00:16:09	00:16:10	1	and i would love to get a line 
00:16:10	00:16:18	2	into my room mhm you know with the portable so even my room and the kitchen 'cause you know my my two greatest living space 
00:16:18	00:16:21	1	right i mean that could be done without much difficulty actually 
00:16:21	00:16:24	2	no like twenty thousand potatoes writer wow 
00:16:24	00:16:27	1	thirty you know i mean i could do something 
00:16:37	00:16:41	1	to get another number is of course yes you have to get telephone ago 
00:16:41	00:16:45	2	yeah 'cause that would be a right to just like splice off of this phone or something or other 
00:16:45	00:16:52	1	yeah that would uh i mean that's actually quite simple yeah but then i still don't know if i could hook up the answering machine 
00:16:52	00:17:01	2	it's hard to say yeah i'd love the answering machine i probably i'm probably just as well not getting too dependent on the telephone 
00:17:01	00:17:15	1	[laughter] i don't know what [noise] didn't you guys uh twenty three hours last spring or something or last uh all the time and the radio in the rain and told me that that i ever utility that's um

00:22:52	00:23:01	2	well i heard the felix was uh they showed pictures of it like on the radar mhm it was absolutely tremendous in the middle of the ocean creating disturbances along the coast 
00:23:01	00:23:02	1	mhm 
00:23:02	00:23:04	2	yeah i keep hoping for one of them to come out here 
00:23:04	00:23:05	1	we did go 
00:23:05	00:23:13	2	that came out towards uh you know into the gulf of mexico and my kid part of mexico or something and we got some some rain and we were like 
00:23:13	00:23:13	1	yeah 
00:23:27	00:23:29	1	years ago and i can i convinced 
00:23:29	00:23:31	2	can't remember 
00:23:31	00:23:34	1	just the city center mhm capital and 
00:23:34	00:23:42	2	yeah we went to some cafes we stay would do it must have stayed at a <unk> certainly at the sheraton somewhere not far from the capital 
00:24:05	00:24:11	1	areas very flat but austin is the is the eastern and of what they call the taxes hill country 
00:24:11	00:24:15	2	um and austin is actually pretty hilly uh let me 
00:24:15	00:24:17	1	that i ride my bicycle 
00:24:17	00:24:28	2	to work most days of the week and uh oh yeah [laughter] plenty of hills but when you go out further west i mean it's dramatically hilly there sort of chocolates and things like that 
00:24:28	00:24:30	1	oh beautiful yeah it's pretty 
00:24:30	00:24:40	2	it's nice it's a nice area austin i <unk> kind of i mean like we're like old time austin ice now been here since nineteen eighty eight 'cause there's been enormous 
00:24:40	00:24:42	1	the population lately californians 
00:24:42	00:24:47	2	basically a lot of people from a lot of places but a lot of california and uh 
00:24:47	00:24:50	1	they're also mellow [laughter] well 
00:24:52	00:24:57	1	well we're getting so many people that all of a sudden you know air pollution is starting to become a problem 
00:24:57	00:25:01	2	and people don't like ride their bikes or anything like that 
00:25:01	00:25:08	1	no i the thing is like you know everybody's driving their cars and people are ah you know they're starting to be this 
00:25:15	00:25:17	1	yeah i am uh we're we're really trying to 
00:25:17	00:25:30	2	to fight that as much as we can i'm certainly doing what i can yeah well when we were in barcelona there are days when i look up on this guy was really brilliantly blue and i thought oh it's so pretty and i thought every once in a while there was a day like that in in austin it's 
00:25:30	00:25:31	1	we've come back we've had so many 
00:25:31	00:25:35	2	hazy days and they called ozone action days where they encourage you not to uh 
00:25:35	00:25:40	1	you leave your car you not to breathe too [laughter] 
00:25:40	00:25:47	2	the thing is is that it's a it's a little different i mean it's not caused by pollution that it's <unk> it's just that we have incredibly dry summers 
00:25:47	00:25:53	1	and uh i mean not so much on like barcelona in that way i mean you remember the haze over the city in barcelona 
00:25:53	00:26:01	2	oh for sure i mean the only thing is when you know when the breeze comes in and blows it out right yeah right oh yeah for sure most one has got tons air pollution 
00:26:01	00:26:12	1	i mean <unk> as far worse air pollution i mean the austin could even imagine i think of all you can ever got that bad it would be ah people will be completely freaked out you know if it was it ever happened one day like that 
00:26:25	00:26:29	2	this line in the sky and it starts in the morning a rush hour and it 
00:26:29	00:26:33	1	makes its way it's like a brown line that makes its way down the coastline during the day 
00:26:33	00:26:38	2	uh it's incredible and it's all basically well besides the other crap that they come back to the library 
00:26:38	00:26:42	1	mostly supported by just exhaust fumes yeah ours 
00:26:42	00:26:53	2	yeah i mean the thing one of the things they said it's like alright since they've had the unleaded fuel and everything and it caused a tremendous drop in the amount of <unk> pollution per vehicle 
00:26:53	00:26:54	1	but 
00:27:06	00:27:08	1	hi lisa 
00:27:08	00:27:15	2	lynne [laughter] we have to call at least that probably by the end of the day 'cause she goes back to school tomorrow oh really 
00:27:15	00:27:16	1	oh poor thing 
00:27:16	00:27:18	2	she goes back in is it 
00:27:18	00:27:22	1	august yeah well it's only macaroni yeah twenty eight right before labor 
00:27:22	00:27:28	2	the way it is in the states usually really we have to go back like a day or two days after 
00:27:28	00:27:34	1	well yeah in elementary school we always went back right after the jerry lewis telephone which was right 
00:27:34	00:27:35	2	yeah um 
00:27:35	00:27:40	1	and they've they've changed it well here in austin it's pretty pitiful they they went back august fourteenth 
00:27:43	00:27:47	1	in florida a few other places they've been experimenting with year round schooling in a lot of areas 
00:27:47	00:27:53	2	and yet you know i'm sure they would love every school to have year round schooling 'cause it's more economical effective or whatever 
00:27:53	00:27:57	1	you know but i don't know how that is if they have to keep the school's running for for more money 
00:27:57	00:28:01	2	thing is is that what what they get to do there's this whole deal to it 
00:28:01	00:28:04	1	but uh teacher hours 
00:28:04	00:28:18	2	[laughter] right i mean they they've done the year they managed to do the year round schooling thing where there's no big summer break but you have a bunch of three week a break i kinda like they do in england uh they take well <unk> weeks i take a week i think 
00:28:18	00:28:23	1	right but yeah england is a bit different but it's the same sort of idea where there is no huge break 
00:28:23	00:28:29	2	mm um and uh they've managed to do without raising any teachers' salaries [laughter] imagine that yeah 
00:28:29	00:28:34	1	it's the same amount of school days only eat throughout the course of the year is that what it is um 
00:28:34	00:28:45	2	<unk> they're trying to increase the school year as well yeah um part of it what does he like the education or even given oh there's not that big summer gap where students forget everything or they forget it 
00:28:45	00:28:46	1	if they actually learned it they wouldn't 
00:28:46	00:28:50	2	forgotten yeah [laughter] 
00:28:50	00:28:54	1	yeah 'cause actually happened during the year now yeah summer 
00:28:54	00:28:56	2	that's for sure oh man what did you 
00:28:56	00:28:59	1	to go to school i mean for for teachers for students for everybody to be in school 
00:28:59	00:29:14	2	summertime isn't anyone ever question <unk> let's see countries like germany have uh a break from oh about the middle of july all the way through october you know october at least the middle of october um and gee they're still doing quite well yeah 
00:29:14	00:29:23	1	well i mean it's it's one of those funny things i was watching t._v. in some <unk> politician republican surprise surprise um that that's recorded for posterity 
00:29:23	00:29:39	2	something about bill bradley as dropped out of the <unk> machine yeah but <unk> regulation is never helped any country in it and uh you know no country's ever be blah blah blah and i'm like you know germany and just 
00:29:39	00:29:43	1	probably the most onerous set of regulations you can imagine mm 
00:29:43	00:29:49	2	so have you heavily bureaucracy sized and full of rules and they're doing pretty good idea yeah 
00:29:49	00:29:57	1	point and say you don't have to have any facts or information you can just make a blatant statement mhm somebody has to just take your word for it and they're all there is um 
00:29:57	00:30:00	2	cast it on national t._v. mm yeah that was part of
