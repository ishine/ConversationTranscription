00:00:00	00:00:01	1	mhm 
00:00:01	00:00:07	2	okay um i was wondering if you could tell me a little bit about the program um what exactly um goes on and 
00:00:09	00:00:19	2	it's an intensive program designed to last for weeks each session of four weeks long although we do have two sessions in nineteen ninety six that will be two weeks long 
00:00:19	00:00:20	1	uh-huh but our general 
00:00:30	00:00:32	1	and then it's 
00:00:49	00:00:52	1	and we have a complete flip 
00:00:52	00:00:59	2	um instruction in that instead of text book and clinical type of destruction we have 
00:01:05	00:01:06	1	[noise] um 
00:01:06	00:01:16	2	at <unk> pottery and if we have a large groups we also also offer um folklore dance and those are two hours a day monday through thursday 
00:01:16	00:01:17	1	mhm and they're really 
00:01:17	00:01:31	2	place not so much to teach students a craft but they're in place to facilitate spanish language acquisition <unk> with a hands on project um it's our our beliefs that using the language 
00:01:31	00:01:32	1	wow 
00:01:32	00:01:41	2	give students in opportunity to have better retention each time they use it they feel a little bit more comfortable the vocabulary expands and whatnot and then the last hour 
00:01:55	00:01:56	1	mhm 
00:01:56	00:01:59	2	english being their native language then half the time would be in 
00:01:59	00:02:01	1	half the time we'd be in spanish 
00:02:01	00:02:02	2	mhm 
00:02:02	00:02:12	1	and we offer um including the course are lectures weekly lectures and do we have films and other cultural presentations 
00:02:12	00:02:25	2	[noise] and all that is included within the same package we also offer optional tours on the weekends going to a point of interest around well <unk> i don't know if you're familiar with what <unk> 
00:02:25	00:02:33	1	um really rich with archaeological sites and indigenous marketplaces and craft villages 
00:02:33	00:02:34	2	yeah so 
00:02:34	00:02:36	1	there's a lot to see 
00:02:36	00:02:40	2	he's he's the program geared primarily toward um 
00:02:40	00:02:44	1	um beginning level uh 
00:02:44	00:02:59	2	no we offer seven different levels ranging from true beginners people who know absolutely nothing about spanish all the way up through advanced and literature levels uh-huh so we have something for everybody when you arrive we would give you a placement test it's a two part tests the first part is 
00:02:59	00:03:04	1	written and it would test you one present tense 
00:03:04	00:03:10	2	um directing indirect objects goes all the way up through subjective and then you actually do some writing as well 
00:03:10	00:03:12	1	after <unk> instructor would grade that 
00:03:12	00:03:15	2	then they would <unk> would 
00:03:15	00:03:16	1	uh speak with you and that would be to 
00:03:16	00:03:32	2	second portion of the test they would ask you a lot of questions about why you're here sitting spanish um where you're from [noise] why are you interested in spanish in particular as opposed to some other language have you visited other places within mexico and whatnot they're really zeroing on how you 
00:03:32	00:03:33	1	mhm 
00:03:33	00:03:42	2	use of language when you're speaking mhm and that helped him to more fine tuned where they place you oh i see and how many people are are in each group uh 
00:03:42	00:03:55	1	maximum according to our brochures ten although we have never had a group of ten um average is more around six and it can be lower uh we've had groups of one before [laughter] set a group i don't think that's a group 
00:03:55	00:04:00	2	[noise] and um how long is it the program 
00:04:10	00:04:13	2	structural gaps [noise] you know when 
00:04:13	00:04:16	1	for example if the classes going on three weeks and then we said 
00:04:16	00:04:19	2	student arrive the end of the second or third week 
00:04:26	00:04:27	2	ready to three weeks 
00:04:27	00:04:35	1	um we frequently though do have students who don't arrive at the beginning because they're they're scheduled don't allow them to have you know conformity 
00:04:35	00:04:37	2	to our our schedule 
00:04:37	00:04:39	1	and they they do it i haven't 
00:04:39	00:04:47	2	the student here several times myself i'm now the assistant director and when i first came i came in the last two weeks of the december session of the first two weeks of the january session 
00:04:47	00:04:52	1	and it was <unk> it was it was difficult for the last two weeks but i did it 
00:04:52	00:04:56	2	[noise] it was the only time i had to operate with and so it was all right 
00:04:56	00:05:01	1	and then of course the january session when i started with the rest of the group at the beginning of the session 
00:05:15	00:05:30	2	or you know we we offer several options the vast majority where students take host family homes as ah the way to go when they're hearing about hanukkah they pay 'em a base price of eleven dollars a day and that includes a private room 
00:05:30	00:05:32	1	and um 
00:05:34	00:05:43	1	and it may or may not included private bath really depends on each family we tell the students that it's not a hotel it's it's a it's a home [noise] and the ideas and so much for luxury 
00:05:43	00:05:56	2	it's more for um really communicating with people into getting to know the cultures by way of the people and the vast majority of the homes or upper middle class to lower upper class are very nice homes and their families that we've 
00:05:56	00:05:57	1	with for years 
00:05:57	00:06:02	2	um if a student wishes other meals with the host family for an additional <unk> 
00:06:02	00:06:06	1	dollars a day and the student can have come meet at which is large midday meal 
00:06:06	00:06:18	2	and you can eat very very well and walk on four dollars but the the four dollar meal would be primarily for the purposes of interacting with the host family and then there's the <unk> which is a very light 
00:06:18	00:06:19	1	it's very late evening 
00:06:19	00:06:22	2	oh that's anywhere between seven thirty nine o'clock at night 
00:06:22	00:06:27	1	[noise] that's an additional two dollars um it can be as simple as <unk> 
00:06:27	00:06:30	2	a couple of hot chocolate mhm 
00:06:30	00:06:37	1	uh and it's not it's not far most not a formal me all the way the the sane is would it be possible to comedy vegetarian 
00:06:37	00:06:50	2	uh-huh oh yeah we do that all the time and we're very used to it especially here in <unk> in mexico in general with tortillas and beans and all the the wealth of fruits and vegetables it would be very simple if if students don't want a home stay and they wish 
00:06:50	00:06:52	1	[noise] too 
00:06:52	00:07:01	2	um alternative accommodations we can help with apartments and hotels and that sort of thing um they would need a center deposit 
00:07:03	00:07:10	2	well when they call us they don't really speaking of spanish or they don't feel comfortable enough with their spanish to make reservations other hotels close by 
00:07:10	00:07:12	1	<unk> yeah 
00:07:12	00:07:21	2	okay and um the answers that you offer workshop and cooking as well mhm uh-huh yeah weaving pottery 
00:07:21	00:07:24	1	mhm and sometimes dance folklore dance 
00:07:24	00:07:27	2	and and that's all incorporated into the 
00:07:27	00:07:28	1	uh-huh 
00:07:43	00:07:48	1	i see and could you give me some ideas to what the the price might be 
00:07:48	00:07:54	2	pay the prices at one time fifty dollar registration fee and four hundred dollars for the session or one hundred dollars by the week 
00:07:54	00:07:55	1	oh one hundred
