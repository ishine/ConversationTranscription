00:00:00	00:00:01	1	like to exercise 
00:00:01	00:00:15	2	generally i do i haven't gotten very much lately i've been extremely busy you know aren't we all [laughter] yeah but uh when i used to do a lot of exercise what i would do is about three times a week i would go out and either go running or <unk> 
00:00:15	00:00:16	1	<unk> uh-huh we're pretty short 
00:00:16	00:00:25	2	distance like two miles two and a half miles and um then if i had enough time uh or or alternate leave for walking i would do some weightless 
00:00:25	00:00:27	1	free weights mhm 
00:00:27	00:00:29	2	and uh 
00:00:29	00:00:34	1	you know i've i wanted to keep it up but the the hard part is finding time to fit it into my day now 
00:00:34	00:00:43	2	that's true <unk> that's about what i try to do um i just go walking and i usually try to [noise] go for about an hour 
00:00:43	00:00:46	1	and i tried doing it every day but 
00:00:46	00:00:48	2	i mean sometimes i don't even 
00:00:48	00:00:49	1	once during the week 
00:00:49	00:00:54	2	you know most of the time i tried to get out there i've got a dog that kinda 
00:00:54	00:00:55	1	helps me out 
00:00:55	00:01:02	2	oh that's <unk> yeah if i go walking i should walk my dog with me yeah you need the exercise he gets bored 
00:01:02	00:01:03	1	you know he's uh he's about a year 
00:01:22	00:01:26	2	sure yeah i have to just drag myself through it but after that when i started 
00:01:43	00:01:45	1	well i think that 
00:01:45	00:01:55	2	but my needs just can't handle the pounding anymore aerobics or running do i know i i know a couple of uh uh women at work who are in 
00:01:57	00:02:04	2	and uh and then one other who said no i tried this you know higher impact and i went to low impact and then i couldn't do it at all 
00:02:04	00:02:07	1	and i've heard of like in swimming pools they teach aerobics 
00:02:07	00:02:10	2	and it's supposed to be really good but 
00:02:10	00:02:13	1	i don't know i like something that's cheap 
00:02:13	00:02:16	2	relaxing as well as good for ya 
00:02:16	00:02:24	1	yeah walking fits that i mean i figure when i go back to uh getting some aerobics exercise it'll probably be walking instead of running 
00:02:24	00:02:26	2	i really enjoy walking 
00:02:26	00:02:30	1	[noise] it seems i don't know i'm i'm just my whole self i'm happier if i go walking 
00:02:30	00:02:36	2	yeah well you lose yourself in the exercise for a while and that's you know you're right 
00:02:36	00:02:37	1	sorry and your worries 
00:02:37	00:02:43	2	[laughter] yeah you get your mind off everything you know i um you know i i want to go back 
00:02:43	00:02:45	1	the weightlifting just because i felt 
00:02:45	00:02:58	2	felt better and look better when i did that and i've got a neighbor who um he does it and i've tried to get in with him and several weeks ago i i'd weightlifting for the first time in about two years and then of course i injured my 
00:02:58	00:02:58	1	yeah 
00:02:58	00:03:06	2	so i haven't been able to do it for weeks it's you know i'm going to i know i'll start again probably sundays and wednesdays 
00:03:06	00:03:07	1	oh wow 
00:03:12	00:03:30	2	[laughter] i don't know i've never i've done a little bit of weightlifting but i never i don't know i if i don't enjoy it it doesn't i don't stick with it yeah terrible that way and well everyone's that way i i uh you know was encouraged a lot when i was younger to do sports and i just hated every one 
00:03:30	00:03:32	1	[laughter] 
00:03:32	00:03:43	2	[laughter] i didn't like the competitiveness of them but i enjoyed playing around with the sports that and you know i enjoy the sport itself i'd probably didn't like the human 
00:03:43	00:03:44	1	[laughter] 
00:03:44	00:03:50	2	that may be me too i uh the only one i ever really enjoyed was a frisbee golf 
00:03:50	00:03:51	1	wow yeah that's 
00:03:51	00:04:03	2	and and i got to be pretty good with a roommate of mine in college uh-huh he was competitive but he toned down we were going out and playing and so it was more of a challenge to myself you know a golfer is mainly trying to get your score 
00:04:03	00:04:04	1	uh-huh and 
00:04:04	00:04:07	2	so it was pretty neat that i enjoyed 
00:04:07	00:04:12	1	but other than that most sports i haven't enjoy maybe a little soccer once in a while 
00:04:12	00:04:32	2	yeah my husband enjoyed soccer he liked that but i think he's the competitive [laughter] type [noise] i'd rather just stick with walking and sometimes i like to go you know neighbor friend of mine goes once in a while with me but a lotta times i like to go by myself whenever i mean 
00:04:32	00:04:34	1	i'll just sit in the middle of the day 
00:04:34	00:04:41	2	whenever i've got 'em in it you know or if i don't have a minute some time to leave any way
