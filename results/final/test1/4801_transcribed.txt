00:04:58	00:05:08	2	well there's something fucked up here and he turned it over to the ministry of labor and said you guys take care of it i think they own own some money so uh um 
00:05:08	00:05:10	1	pretty sure 
00:05:10	00:05:18	2	going to get uh that i'm going to get something out of 'em uh-huh not sure how much but at any rate of show goes pissed on at least getting the satisfaction 
00:05:18	00:05:22	1	yeah because [laughter] you know i mean the 
00:05:22	00:05:26	2	the worst thing for <unk> to have a bad image right mhm 
00:05:26	00:05:28	1	and worked out okay mm 
00:05:28	00:05:42	2	makes it sound like you know all this all this stuff going on but really what i knew when she was talking to me what i know even more now is that a couple of people have come in and and showed her that they're not happy with the way that 
00:05:49	00:05:57	1	she has projected that everybody and she thinks that everybody thinks he's an awful person and and that you're going around telling everybody in town and all 
00:06:11	00:06:18	2	it's it's just piss me off and if she calls again you might wanna mention too or is it all she has to do is pay me the money that i have 
00:06:18	00:06:21	1	coming to me but she doesn't understand that you 
00:06:26	00:06:27	1	i don't 
00:06:27	00:06:31	2	expect to ever see her have direct contact with her again 
00:06:31	00:06:32	1	huh 
00:06:32	00:06:33	2	she never won 
00:06:33	00:06:37	1	said anything to me i mean i 
00:06:41	00:06:42	1	uh-huh 
00:06:42	00:06:51	2	the last time i saw her was when well actually it's been a month and the last time i saw her was when we uh to keep the air 
00:06:53	00:06:55	2	yeah um 
00:06:55	00:07:00	1	so [laughter] i really i really have no sympathy for the one i'm sorry 
00:07:00	00:07:08	2	and you know she she tried to tell me some bullshit but she was going to um she said that she was prepared 
00:07:08	00:07:11	1	<unk> uh a letter on your <unk> 
00:07:11	00:07:17	2	to be given to some people so that she could try and find you another job 
00:07:17	00:07:18	1	yeah right 
00:07:18	00:07:35	2	right and so but anyway he wanted she wanted me to know you know she i was right in the middle of rightness letter and all of a sudden this stuff comes down out of the blue and you know i mean i'm not gonna give him a letter from keeps this stuff up and stuff like that but anyway i knew that was crap when i heard it 
00:07:35	00:07:41	1	i would rather have a month salaries and a letter from show 
00:07:41	00:07:44	2	[laughter] 
00:07:44	00:07:52	1	well yeah i that's just absolute crap though i mean you don't fire somebody and then go out of your way 
00:07:52	00:08:01	2	uh yeah i can help them find another job and um that's just absolute bullshit and especially because 
00:08:01	00:08:02	1	mhm 
00:08:15	00:08:19	2	you've never had any real contact with her so i you know that's that's 
00:08:19	00:08:21	1	right right 
00:08:21	00:08:23	2	yeah 
00:08:23	00:08:26	1	just bullshit but um 
00:08:36	00:08:53	2	i want as i said i'll take june on 'em on because i calculated the the way they showed me this calculated mhm and i think they actually when they paid me my last month salary paid me uh about a month i'm on too much actually i think i'm sure they did that simply because it was 
00:08:53	00:08:55	1	er to calculate uh-huh 
00:08:55	00:09:00	2	ah they gave me to go on for august and then for the last eleven days that i worked 
00:09:00	00:09:03	1	uh the sixteenth of august twenty six 
00:09:03	00:09:10	2	august uh-huh dumont and i think i really should that should have been actually <unk> six hundred something

00:09:43	00:09:43	1	mhm

00:12:25	00:12:28	1	park in the motorcycle <unk> way up close to the house for nobody will fuck with it 
00:12:28	00:12:30	2	[noise] um 
00:12:30	00:12:37	1	keeping an eye on at work uh made it clear to <unk> and the other guys work it down under that 
00:12:37	00:12:37	2	the um 
00:12:37	00:12:40	1	[noise] if anybody absolutely anybody that they don't 
00:12:40	00:12:51	2	no very well happens to ask about me working there that uh i'm doing it just for fun i'm not receiving any payment at all ah what makes 
00:12:51	00:12:53	1	you think that he's going to try to mess with you 
00:12:53	00:12:59	2	[noise] i have no reason she's done nothing but messed with me since today i've gotten there 
00:12:59	00:13:04	1	she wouldn't do anything bottling she wouldn't do anything to that well 
00:13:04	00:13:16	2	what i'm doing <unk> maybe probably not but the thing down under is working there is actually um i guess this is on tape and stuff but it's actually uh if i were receiving money there 
00:13:19	00:13:25	2	and it's you know what i'm doing i'm trying to discredit them to some degree um discredited in 
00:13:25	00:13:27	1	the eyes of the labor union and 
00:13:27	00:13:33	2	trying to get ah they may end up having to pay a fine and make some kind of black lifted the labor union decides 
00:13:33	00:13:35	1	favor right which i 
00:13:35	00:13:45	2	think they will they may have some kind of penalty to pay for that if if nothing else who has to do a lot of ah eating crew in the ministry of labor comes back around and says 
00:13:45	00:13:47	1	you do have to pay 
00:13:47	00:13:48	2	oh no 
00:14:09	00:14:10	1	mhm 
00:14:10	00:14:24	2	<unk> had lied from the word go about the circumstances being fired and they could they could have said when the ministry of labor guy first came [noise] they could have said oh well we told them a month ahead of time 
00:14:24	00:14:26	1	yeah or 
00:14:34	00:14:41	1	from the word go they told the truth which surprised me that was my biggest concern but they did tell the truth about that 
00:14:41	00:14:49	2	[noise] so they're not going to get messed up for not having paid you the full and twenty five mine and and all that stuff 
00:14:49	00:14:52	1	oh it was that what the show was worried about now i don't think 
00:14:52	00:15:01	2	she didn't mention she didn't talking in much detail at all but i mean i thought when i talk to you you are going to go for some of that too 
00:15:02	00:15:13	2	that depends it depends on uh i i don't think there's much i can do about it you know somebody one of the guys that the er labor unions said that they're not actually 
00:15:13	00:15:16	1	mm but 
00:15:27	00:15:29	1	but uh at any rate 
00:15:29	00:15:41	2	i'm not going to pursue that because it turns out regardless of the law unless i went to court or all kinds of big stuff the only thing that the ministry of labor can go on is what i 
00:15:41	00:15:43	1	greed too yeah 
00:15:43	00:15:50	2	and i i was honest with that i i i was thinking man i could go in there and sit down and say look you know i i've got this contract that says 
00:15:50	00:15:52	1	twenty five mom but i've only been getting fifteen 
00:15:52	00:15:56	2	[noise] i was thinking about doing that but i thought no i'm going to do it right i'm going to be honest 
00:15:56	00:15:58	1	yeah all i want is 
00:15:58	00:16:07	2	that last month salary so as long as i get the last month salary i'm going to completely drop it um get on with my life which i'm doing anyway 
00:16:07	00:16:08	1	yeah well it sounds i guess 
00:16:18	00:16:19	1	but i'm not hurting for 
00:16:19	00:16:26	2	uh i've got enough yeah but uh more is always better so [laughter] 
00:16:26	00:16:33	1	here i'm glad that you've you've got that position and all that stuff i i think you're happier than you were before anyway so
