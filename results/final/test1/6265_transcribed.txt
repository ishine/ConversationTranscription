00:16:54	00:17:00	2	i can't imagine why it would be that way like why that would happen 
00:17:00	00:17:01	1	mhm 
00:17:02	00:17:04	1	mhm 
00:17:04	00:17:09	2	and so i try to start to imagine why 
00:17:09	00:17:10	1	and 
00:17:16	00:17:19	2	and i think about the time when um 
00:17:19	00:17:20	1	mhm 
00:17:22	00:17:23	1	pardon 
00:17:23	00:17:24	2	mhm

00:17:30	00:17:32	1	we're really together 
00:17:32	00:17:35	2	that that you are in a lexus wouldn't like 
00:17:35	00:17:37	1	mhm

00:18:01	00:18:11	1	well i'm just wondering if if the fact that you all did that had it's anything to do with the fact that i have um strange dreams with alexis 
00:18:11	00:18:19	2	i don't know why you do okay that would be the only reason i can thank god 
00:18:19	00:18:20	1	mhm
