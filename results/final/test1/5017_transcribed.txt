00:00:51	00:00:53	1	right and so 
00:00:53	00:00:56	2	i was um you know i just wanted to touch base on 
00:00:56	00:00:58	1	she called i i wasn't home 
00:00:58	00:00:59	2	and she didn't know 
00:00:59	00:01:02	1	where you know when we were i would be 
00:01:02	00:01:10	2	and that's who i says no i start october second so mhm um so she said fine um now she knows mhm but 
00:01:10	00:01:12	1	[noise] uh 
00:01:37	00:01:40	2	good that's fine yeah yeah 
00:01:40	00:01:43	1	anything new changing or 
00:01:43	00:01:51	2	no yeah no it's the same on things well what's up with you i'm 
00:02:02	00:02:06	2	um do not that thrilled about it but 
00:02:06	00:02:08	1	oh you mean that year 
00:02:08	00:02:15	2	leaving that i'm leaving that they're going to have to go into another class it's already going and um 
00:02:15	00:02:19	1	uh you know with a lot of other people mhm and so 
00:02:19	00:02:23	2	they're not happy about that so um 
00:02:23	00:02:30	1	but anyway uh you know that's they don't have any choice that's the way the programs going to be 
00:02:43	00:02:46	1	yeah so i'm really 
00:02:56	00:02:58	1	i think you should move down there 
00:02:58	00:03:00	2	[noise] um 
00:03:00	00:03:04	1	thinking about it if you're paying this woman money plus you're paying your rent 
00:03:04	00:03:08	2	yeah it would be worth it to get an apartment down there you're paying the same 
00:03:08	00:03:11	1	yeah i <unk> that would be that would be much 
00:03:20	00:03:23	1	look though i mean i don't think they're 
00:03:23	00:03:26	2	i know i know there are higher they're probably a little bit higher than 
00:03:26	00:03:31	1	you're paying now but if you're paying that woman money just stay there and you're paying 
00:03:35	00:03:38	1	yeah i want to be right in the town 
00:03:38	00:03:40	2	right in the city where i'm working 
00:03:40	00:03:41	1	okay well oh 
00:03:41	00:03:53	2	well it's nice i mean it it's a good place but just to cut down on a on a commuting uh-huh 'cause if i am and i'm in the right place i'd only be like two or three miles from the job then what i would like ideally that's what i 
00:03:53	00:03:56	1	mhm um 
00:03:56	00:04:11	2	when i when i start there's there's somebody down there that's dealing that that has that into real estate and i'm going to ask but i've been reading the paper and um [noise] the um you know they they want like close to a thousand dollars mhm though 
00:04:30	00:04:32	1	it's it's cheaper 
00:04:32	00:04:44	2	and um and then i would um you know load up on my groceries and anything i was going to have i bring down there so i kind of avoid it that way mhm but um you know why 
00:04:44	00:04:50	1	that would be a whole lot easier but then i don't know whenever 
00:04:50	00:04:55	2	i would get to see you in like um i wouldn't be a lot 
00:04:55	00:04:57	1	closer to right 
00:04:57	00:05:07	2	and that and that part i'd like but uh like for any you know any occasions anything um you know i uh i don't know 
00:05:08	00:05:21	2	uh yeah i i just got the feeling that uh that you would probably come up to this area but not where i am is you know is often so i 
00:05:21	00:05:23	1	mm i don't know about that 
00:05:28	00:05:29	1	you know 
00:05:46	00:05:49	2	then uh is i was saying on the on the other hand 
00:05:49	00:05:51	1	as soon as that is kind of a <unk> a little bit 
00:05:51	00:06:10	2	ridiculous though just stay in you know one place for an you know for an occasion for thanksgiving that comes around once a year mm you know i mean i don't know yeah i yeah i know it's so i i uh i i'm stuck here at least through uh 
00:06:10	00:06:11	1	august mhm 
00:06:11	00:06:15	2	because of <unk> but even even at that i'm i'm not 
00:06:15	00:06:18	1	i'm stuck here but i'm tied in but i'm not if 
00:06:18	00:06:34	2	if i wanted to leave i could do that um i could just wait until somebody comes in and once the place and so i wouldn't be pressed to go and then the other option that i was thinking of is after the um uh after the cars paid 
00:06:34	00:06:36	1	[noise] to go 
00:06:36	00:06:39	2	[noise] uh move my stuff into big 
00:06:39	00:06:40	1	men and you 
00:06:40	00:06:54	2	that as a primary residence but yet but then like rent a room down there in the town i'm i'm working in so at least what i'll be paying is um a room which which would be a lot cheaper and and um 
00:06:59	00:07:04	2	you know have to have residency before that thing is so if it ever is so um 
00:07:09	00:07:13	2	three out of the last five years before selling or something like that 
00:07:13	00:07:18	1	and uh hopefully beat minimal stay off my back as far as having renters they don't want 
00:07:18	00:07:26	2	mhm they want they want a damn owner occupied mhm and uh so i'm kind of ah 
00:07:26	00:07:28	1	[noise] uh 
00:07:28	00:07:46	2	you know kind of fun doing it for now and they i told them a couple of years ago that as soon as i uh found a job in that area and then i would come in there which you know really was was my intention so i'm just trying to [noise] i have to see how things go down here and 
00:07:46	00:07:47	1	abilities aaron 
00:07:47	00:07:49	2	and stuff but 
00:07:49	00:07:51	1	well whatever i mean it's your commute 
00:07:51	00:08:14	2	yeah yeah oh well that's it i'm i know i already i'm going to go down there on a on a second i'm gonna stay with her on the second and um on the third um the next day i'm coming back here because then we have the um that jewish holiday off in the middle of the week mhm do you get any you don't get any of those <unk> do you yeah 
00:08:14	00:08:15	1	mhm 
00:08:19	00:08:22	1	it's a tough situation the the size of the place that i have 
00:08:22	00:08:25	2	mhm um you know with that 
00:08:25	00:08:26	1	with that triple 
00:08:38	00:08:41	2	uh-huh i know i you know 
00:08:41	00:08:43	1	[noise] you're you're kind of tolerating it and i 
00:08:43	00:08:53	2	exactly i mean for the next couple of years we've put so much work into it and you know i don't know that it's like 
00:08:53	00:09:03	1	if it's so much time and work and moving things than that it's like you know i don't i'm not going to move but i don't totally love it here yeah yeah 
00:09:13	00:09:19	2	[noise] i don't know it's like trying to show him i mean i might talk to them about the windows but i was trying to show him like 
00:09:19	00:09:20	1	all the work 
00:09:20	00:09:29	2	we did in the kitchen and everything because he hadn't seen it and it totally like one over his head i'm like oh look at the i'm like look at the cabinet and everything and he goes
