00:04:15	00:04:18	1	[laughter] 
00:04:18	00:04:25	2	oh that is funny [laughter] oh okay and um there are other things i need to tell you i was talking to 
00:04:25	00:04:29	1	sure uh-huh and he needs to know 
00:04:29	00:04:34	2	<unk> whether there'll be more than one set up or just one set up 
00:04:34	00:04:39	1	you know the set up would be you know everybody being photographed in the same place 
00:04:39	00:04:41	2	yeah i know yeah just one one 
00:04:41	00:04:42	1	okay 
00:04:42	00:04:49	2	[noise] and then he needs to tell him i want black solving huh i want black velvet <unk> that's that's a really 
00:04:49	00:04:51	1	mhm 
00:04:51	00:04:54	2	okay okay 
00:04:54	00:05:01	1	and then uh he needs to know how many different shots you anticipate 
00:05:01	00:05:13	2	yeah i have to think about that okay okay i told him how many rolls i wanted <unk> um did he i told them i wanna tend to 
00:05:13	00:05:14	1	okay 
00:05:14	00:05:27	2	okay but i think it might actually have to pay more than ten mhm well i mean obviously you know the expenses go up the more he has to shoot you know what i mean 
00:05:27	00:05:29	1	yeah yeah 
00:05:47	00:05:48	2	yes 
00:05:48	00:05:50	1	yes okay 
00:05:50	00:06:01	2	and if it's not going to cost too much i'd like to buy one of the roles which ever role is the nicest one i'd like to buy that wrong 
00:06:04	00:06:14	1	oh okay so you'll have to think about how many different shots there would be like people set up 
00:06:14	00:06:18	2	mhm yeah okay 
00:06:18	00:06:18	1	mhm 
00:06:18	00:06:24	2	and then do you actually want any photograph taken during the ceremony itself 
00:06:29	00:06:30	1	okay 
00:06:42	00:06:43	1	mhm 
00:06:43	00:06:52	2	um so i think that's better actually if you if you know this way he could just take all the pictures he needs to take actually before the ceremony itself 
00:06:52	00:06:53	1	mhm 
00:06:53	00:07:03	2	[noise] and what i would like to do which you know we've heard about people doing elsewhere for the color ones during the male is you know put some of those disposable cameras on some cable you know 
00:07:03	00:07:05	1	mhm 
00:07:05	00:07:08	2	'cause then i'll i'll i'll be sure to get pictures of my friends and stuff 
00:07:08	00:07:09	1	mhm 
00:07:09	00:07:11	2	yeah that's good 
00:07:11	00:07:13	1	what do you think of that so that's fun 
00:07:13	00:07:19	2	yeah but i think that's valid mhm okay well i told them i would get back to him how many roasted you tell them 
00:07:19	00:07:23	1	i told him ten two and a quarter but it's going to i think it's going to have to be more than that 
00:07:26	00:07:28	1	mhm 
00:07:28	00:07:36	2	yeah [noise] okay well anyway what you do have to think about is the number of sort of people post 
00:07:36	00:07:40	1	mhm yeah oh i do 
00:07:40	00:07:47	2	mhm because i mean you know <unk> he has to do a lot of <unk> enough time in order to accomplish 
00:07:47	00:07:48	1	for all of that mhm 
00:07:48	00:08:03	2	it's not as if and i mean i know what it's like at drexel you know when we had bunches of people getting their pictures taken mhm uh it takes a while to get them appropriately set up you know you have to take several shots of each group being and all of that can take a considerable amount of time 
00:08:03	00:08:05	1	yeah 
00:08:05	00:08:10	2	yeah oh um oh i'll think about all that 
00:08:14	00:08:22	1	<unk> yeah okay well you know anytime you've you can probably let them know that when you come back here you think so i would think so 
00:08:22	00:08:30	2	i can call him and ask him uh that i could but i think you can probably let them know pretty close to the time itself okay but anyway we'll find out about it 
00:08:30	00:08:31	1	[laughter] 
00:08:31	00:08:39	2	i um you know the invitations have gone out along the middle of the information on travel in philadelphia i sent a map mhm 
00:08:39	00:08:40	1	book and see how to get to the <unk> 
00:08:40	00:08:42	2	oh that's nice

00:09:21	00:09:23	2	okay did you check on triples or no

00:09:25	00:09:30	2	oh okay oh i know that that's a deal that's not 
00:09:31	00:09:34	2	it's not the regular regular prices a hundred and twenty

00:10:12	00:10:26	2	um you know in that area of town you could actually eat quite expend inexpensively mhm uh because there are a lot of um of asian restaurants that you can walk to within a couple of blocks mhm that's so you know it's uh it's uh

00:10:30	00:10:32	1	relatively inexpensively around the bar 
00:10:32	00:10:34	2	yeah 
00:10:34	00:10:35	1	so that actually turned out to be the

00:12:42	00:12:43	1	walked around 
00:12:43	00:12:51	2	like behind to one of her friends or something like she was nervous or something right i think and this is just too weird and i didn't recognize it as 
00:12:51	00:12:53	1	and then i walk past the bus 
00:12:53	00:13:02	2	and then i turned around and i just looked at her and then i just started smiling and she started smiling and so i kinda knew it with her and everything but isn't that crazy 
00:13:02	00:13:12	1	yeah well <unk> yeah that's what i thought yeah it is a small world yeah so she was there was some sort of italian 
00:13:12	00:13:17	2	well it was like a school group or she has a thing because it was all kids you know right fifteen sixteen years 
00:13:17	00:13:21	1	visiting the british museum yeah 
00:13:21	00:13:39	2	okay okay very good very good [noise] i also incidentally cold um the marriage licence bureau in philadelphia oh okay now if you're getting married on saturday night the latest date on which you can apply for the license is receiving monday 
00:13:39	00:13:41	1	preceding monday 
00:13:41	00:13:46	2	which would would be the fourth of september 
00:13:46	00:13:49	1	[noise] is that the priest about they want to waste the monday before 
00:13:59	00:14:00	2	labor day 
00:14:00	00:14:02	1	oh oh god it's labor day 
00:14:02	00:14:04	2	so it's got to be the week before 
00:14:04	00:14:06	1	so probably have to do with the friday before then 
00:14:06	00:14:14	2	apply any day of the week yeah okay well i can i can check on this i get to see what happens because of labor day you're absolutely right 
00:14:14	00:14:17	1	[noise] well we were thinking was that he would come 
00:14:17	00:14:21	2	when is that that wednesday about the twenty sixth 
00:14:21	00:14:22	1	okay well up critic 
00:14:22	00:14:26	2	import hold on i'm sorry the ah thirtieth 
00:14:26	00:14:28	1	or so okay critical important yeah 
00:14:47	00:14:49	1	well my mom knows 
00:15:07	00:15:10	1	for him probably okay 
00:15:10	00:15:21	2	yeah but what i'll do is i'll call the doctor's office on monday just to be sure that they can do a blood test overnight because that way you could have it done on wednesday get the results on thursday 
00:15:21	00:15:24	1	day and go marriage license on friday 
00:15:35	00:15:48	1	yeah but that's uh a state holiday so that's that so we have to have the blood test about three days before that you're going to have to come in here i'm gonna have to pick you up in new york and bring it back i think er newark you're going to come into 
00:15:48	00:15:51	2	case i mean that <unk> let me find out for sure 
00:15:51	00:15:56	1	[noise] you know see the thing is because he can get a cheaper plane ticket on the first 
00:15:56	00:15:59	2	which is what day of the week 
00:15:59	00:16:03	1	that's a friday oh i see i don't think that will work 
00:16:03	00:16:04	2	no because it's 
00:16:04	00:16:08	1	i mean you're not going to be able to get applied for any broad worked on all over the weekend 
00:16:08	00:16:17	2	yeah okay yeah truly says thinks we're finding that out for her [laughter] you're just not going to be able to do that 
00:16:17	00:16:17	1	okay 
00:16:17	00:16:22	2	i mean otherwise you will be <unk> 
00:16:22	00:16:26	1	oh boy [laughter] okay 
00:16:26	00:16:29	2	mhm and so um 
00:16:29	00:16:33	1	and two they guarantee that when you apply for the marriage licence you'll get it and 
00:16:33	00:16:40	2	yeah she <unk> she said if you apply on monday you'll have it by friday okay and you just have to have it the day before 
00:16:40	00:16:41	1	okay 
00:16:41	00:16:52	2	okay but if you were to apply the preceding friday which is what i would recommend especially because of a holiday then you could probably pick it up on thursday or so so they'd be less 
00:16:52	00:16:54	1	mhm okay 
00:16:54	00:17:01	2	so something like that i think would work and i said specifically what could charlie and hilary have the blood work done in england 
00:17:24	00:17:31	1	[noise] you know because the only other state that would be reasonable as new york state but i think that can just lend to certain kinds of 
00:17:31	00:17:32	2	okay yeah 
00:17:32	00:17:33	1	iraq 
00:17:33	00:17:39	2	yeah no i'm in san francisco to <unk> 
00:17:39	00:17:42	1	won't get lost or anything right now 
00:17:42	00:17:46	2	right and so that's uh that's something to think about as well 
00:17:46	00:17:48	1	yeah 
00:17:48	00:17:54	2	okay i mean particularly in terms of of the <unk> the um the flight the charlie which is
