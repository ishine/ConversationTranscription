00:02:07	00:02:09	1	well and that they've 
00:02:09	00:02:17	2	they're doing starting construction across the street again so they came through with the big earth mover which on earth huge amounts of stone so it's just

00:02:23	00:02:32	1	i took my [noise] my wheelbarrow but it was broke and unfortunately and so uh i still got all i could want without <unk> even go anywhere in the wheelbarrow 'cause there's so many 
00:02:32	00:02:38	2	oh how neat just dug up huge it's just most incredible rocky soil over there so 
00:02:38	00:02:43	1	so then are you are you going to like slant little stuffed between the stone so it looks 
00:02:43	00:02:48	2	<unk> no it's gonna be irritating all it's going to be like uh what's your take on 
00:02:48	00:02:51	1	on one side you can see it as well you know that's gonna 
00:02:51	00:03:01	2	that's gonna be underneath the trees debt back in the woods <unk> oh i see so you won't have to [noise] so i'm i'm raising the ground improving the ground i've been

00:03:16	00:03:21	1	um also i have still have i have lots and lots of grasshoppers i have a wicked time with grasshoppers 
00:03:21	00:03:28	2	[noise] um but i think part of that because the weeds just got out of control close by and so they had lots of places to hang up 
00:03:28	00:03:32	1	now do you just know that part you haven't garden or what do you do with it 
00:03:32	00:03:35	2	well most of it's lawn yeah and i just got

00:03:36	00:03:46	2	[noise] jeeze almost two months because we haven't had any rain been no rain so ah we finally started to get a little rain and so i thought well 
00:03:46	00:03:48	1	guess i'm a little odd yeah but 
00:03:48	00:03:50	2	parts of it just didn't need it at all so 
00:03:55	00:04:16	2	recorded i bet you've forgotten it by now huh what forgotten by now that we're being recorded well well i was just listening to you talk and i was thinking well i don't work here you don't hardly gardening he goes to kind of thing to talk about when you being recorded is true but i took out my we'd <unk> around the electric fence so it should be doing better again so 
00:04:16	00:04:17	1	how's your door in by now

00:04:37	00:04:48	2	big dog <unk> kind of got left home and <unk> was wandering the streets and so we took him in and called his owner and watching played with them for a long time and had a really good time so [noise] and i almost felt 
00:04:56	00:05:05	2	take care of your your door too from the outside and inside i'd like to see that well it's a beautiful door so 
00:05:05	00:05:07	1	does it have a stupid then outside

00:05:14	00:05:32	2	well not for this you don't because it's it's you don't have to have anything you can just step outside but it's i went and got a um [noise] i picked i went to a stone korean picked out a stone and had this great big stone delivered and then they also deliver to stones that they put down in the river so i can go 
00:05:32	00:05:40	1	stand [noise] it's really nice having a little couple of <unk> 'cause it used to be i'd go down and it's being knocking out now right go and i stand on my beautiful 
00:05:40	00:05:43	2	oh [laughter] 
00:05:43	00:05:46	1	that sounds really nice yeah it's nice yeah 
00:05:46	00:05:48	2	have you been doing 
00:05:48	00:05:55	1	well i've just been working but i'm planning my next vacation which is i'm going in september to japan 
00:05:55	00:06:05	2	no <unk> well no actually i'm going into debt to do it but i decided you know i've been telling my students <unk> lived here 
00:06:05	00:06:08	1	two years ago and she's the one that really said come and stay with me 
00:06:08	00:06:14	2	and then this other girl that i had a <unk> as a student ten years ago [noise] still keeps in touch and she 
00:06:14	00:06:17	1	called me and said when are you coming and i thought if i don't go there 
00:06:17	00:06:27	2	stop asking me and that way you know and this way at least it you know i can go and have a place to stay part of the time anyway but i'm going on a courier flight too 
00:06:27	00:06:32	1	you know where um you carry somebody else's luggage or something and 
00:06:32	00:06:38	2	a buddy drugs mailed harry anything illegal or if you're going to don't discuss it now ah the tape 
00:06:38	00:06:42	1	probably say well it's really like being a spy you should see these 
00:06:42	00:07:01	2	struck since i have you know it's just like you have to get to the airport and look for a guy in a blue jacket with a certain kind of and save me on it and he will give few papers and take you to the luggage place in check you and and then the luggage will go and then you have one carry on peace that you get to take and then and then when you get 
00:07:01	00:07:09	1	japan you have to deliver the papers to a guy that's at a certain location in the immigration area and then he will 
00:07:09	00:07:18	2	they could lie is are you kidding i think you're carrying probably i'm carrying boxes of stuff or i might be carrying suitcases i don't i don't live with 
00:07:29	00:07:37	1	to the papers and takes a paper so it's not like you go through and the customs people say well and the pay per se what's in this 
00:07:37	00:07:40	2	you know but there's a guy there that to explain it so 
00:07:40	00:07:43	1	supposedly it's gotta be illegal 
00:07:43	00:07:53	2	and then when you come back you call you call a man named mister <unk> and you tell them that you're back in town and he'll tell you where to meet him and then you go to the airport and you meet 
00:07:53	00:07:54	1	a guy who 
00:07:54	00:08:06	2	may or may not give you things to bring back because that's um that's not sure but he gives you back your tickets see when you get to japan and they take your return ticket and you can have it back until you come 
00:08:12	00:08:15	1	he's very bizarre 
00:08:15	00:08:21	2	but <unk> it's like a third of the cost of the round trip ticket to japan in fact 
00:08:21	00:08:22	1	it was four hundred 
00:08:22	00:08:28	2	there's round trip right to japan so and <unk> yeah jesus must be 
00:08:28	00:08:30	1	seventeen hundred from here 
00:08:30	00:08:39	2	it's it's twelve hundred from here but it's i'm paying for oh well i'm paying four hundred yeah oh that's very cheap yeah but um 
00:08:39	00:08:44	1	that and then if you have a place to stay right and of course they had to stay on it costs about eight hundred dollars a day to just 
00:08:44	00:08:48	2	walk around well and i'm gonna get a train path 
00:08:58	00:09:04	1	one one of those trades where they shove you write a bully push you it'd be hide behind a pack 
00:09:04	00:09:17	2	in one one flight in japan like i wanted to go <unk> that's where <unk> you know in the very north north part and a round trip flight from tokyo's costs more than my round trip flight 
00:09:17	00:09:19	1	oh man so 
00:09:19	00:09:35	2	really the bullet train is going to be the only way to go you know and i figure like it when i go there if i stay in those japanese hotels where they have to <unk> rice walls and stuff it's not so expensive i just got a book yesterday to find where the cheap 
00:09:35	00:09:38	1	those are <unk> [noise] so 
00:09:38	00:09:39	2	anyway i'm just going 
00:09:39	00:09:45	1	but so far i haven't been able to reach my friend in tokyo that's <unk> who lived here 
00:09:49	00:09:57	1	i don't have her phone number and i wrote her a card and she hasn't called me back or written me back but the other girl already called me back 
00:09:57	00:10:07	2	and and we're sets you know but <unk> it's kind of the key 'cause she's in tokyo and that's where i really need to have a place to put my stuff you know 
00:10:07	00:10:09	1	so how long have you to go for 
00:10:09	00:10:12	2	eleven days i was gonna go for seven 
00:10:12	00:10:16	1	but then i thought you know going all that way and i may never go 
00:10:24	00:10:25	1	you know pay for 
00:10:25	00:10:31	2	<unk> and i have to pay for food and they say that's real expensive you know yeah a cup of coffee 
00:10:31	00:10:33	1	feet five dollars 
00:10:33	00:10:34	2	hamburger 
00:10:34	00:10:36	1	twenty five dollar when it's five dollars 
00:10:36	00:10:44	2	so i'm gonna try and you know eat a lot of noodles and plane rice i don't like japanese food very well i don't either 
00:10:55	00:10:58	1	so i like temper uh that's about it

00:11:17	00:11:19	1	you got to be lots of rice 
00:11:19	00:11:27	2	<unk> [laughter] well that's okay that's better that than spending lots of money and getting sick anyway mhm

00:13:50	00:13:57	1	something like that well i think you'd probably have a pretty find garden and maybe we should call health beautiful 
00:13:57	00:14:06	2	you know i'd say a couple of <unk> only because i have really bad soil and so i basically have to just replace soil and 
00:14:06	00:14:07	1	[noise] <unk> 
00:14:07	00:14:13	2	time and it's a lot of money and finally i'm getting some <unk> going but it takes a long time to get that going and

00:16:28	00:16:48	2	hi it's five feet and it's oh would with why are backing and it just it just overpower as a house but i i'm getting used to it now now to me it just looks like a little farm flow farmyard which i like and next year it's going to get roses and climate is climbing up and so he does little get all covered with 
00:16:48	00:16:52	1	and stuff freddy [noise] but right now it's still a big over <unk> 
00:16:52	00:16:54	2	but watching loves it 
00:16:54	00:16:57	1	oh yeah that's nice what since 
00:17:07	00:17:10	1	the hell and it was like the kind of place 
00:17:10	00:17:25	2	watching with chewed up but he was sitting in the window you know looking at me from the house and i thought well you know and so he came outside and he was <unk> you know i was picking up the stuff and he's kind of sneaking away and i said i know you could have done it wasn't because you're in the house so you don't have to sneak away 
00:17:25	00:17:27	1	we said this guilt complex 
00:17:27	00:17:32	2	uh-huh 'cause they're stuffed chewed up in the yard and so i went inside and there was on my answering machine 
00:17:33	00:17:40	2	message from ah rachel that said [noise] watching was outside today and and uh we came by and 
00:17:40	00:17:42	1	we didn't think he should be 
00:17:42	00:18:01	2	it around 'cause he was barking at some of the kids and so we put 'em in the yard and put them inside the fence and [noise] and i couldn't figure out how he'd gotten out and i finally realized that i think i probably just left it open by mistake on the back but he just stayed in the yard all day he didn't go anywhere he did bark at some kids which is why they lost 
00:18:01	00:18:05	1	but um now how does he go in and out he has a doggie door 
00:18:05	00:18:16	2	he has a dog door where in the new door in the new door i think that goes into the kitchen and he just runs in and out and well that's good and then he has his own little yard 
00:18:16	00:18:17	1	side 
00:18:34	00:18:38	1	can run in the house if some if he sees somebody he can 
00:18:38	00:18:42	2	see them from any way they approach the house if they get in the house he can read right it's 
00:18:42	00:18:45	1	side of bite him right [laughter] oh as they break the window 
00:18:45	00:18:53	2	down and watch and get down so um and he likes it a lot so 
00:18:53	00:18:55	1	what i mean that can't go 
00:18:55	00:19:09	2	back there because she gets trapped so <unk> well she could really but she she'd have to climb the wire and right so she's decided that it's actually not in a place that she prefers which is fine with me yeah 
00:19:09	00:19:12	1	yeah wow that's nice <unk> 
00:19:12	00:19:13	2	[noise]

00:19:32	00:19:45	1	vacation time so i won't have teaching time in there so it's the perfect i mean it's just the these courier flights you kinda have to go when they say they have a flight you know you can't say i want to go on this 
00:19:45	00:19:47	2	and come back on this oh you can't no

00:20:22	00:20:24	1	and when i'm doing but you have to go 
00:20:24	00:20:30	2	on their schedule but i'm going on singapore airlines which everybody says is a wonderful airline 
00:20:30	00:20:33	1	well i think he should have to go first class to protect the value

00:20:44	00:20:50	2	regulation smallest sites of those little suitcases <unk> and so you can take 
00:20:50	00:20:54	1	and i can take one carry on bag but i figure i can also work 
00:20:54	00:20:58	2	with lots of pockets and i can also have a big purse 
00:20:58	00:20:59	1	a giant 
00:20:59	00:21:02	2	it's nice to have one big i think it's <unk> nice to have 
00:21:02	00:21:04	1	yeah it is all about us 
00:21:19	00:21:20	1	oh 
00:21:20	00:21:21	2	i think so 
00:21:21	00:21:31	1	no no oh goodness sake oh i thought it was that high uh i don't think so then the southern part is quite warm you know it's 
00:21:31	00:21:35	2	last good would be going to cross northern russia 
00:21:41	00:21:50	2	wait it out i could be more like canada yeah more like well well it's better but i still think it's cooler 
00:21:50	00:21:58	1	than it is here you know you should watch some of the weather channel right now because the weather channel is telling us what temperature 
00:21:58	00:22:16	2	i just happened to watch it i don't usually watch it but for some reason i was watching it the other day and it was telling me what the temperature was in greece and and about the storm going across czechoslovakia and it just sort of basically told you you know what the weather was like in in it was funny to watch you know how when we when we look at storms here 
00:22:16	00:22:18	1	um well i don't know about you but 
00:22:18	00:22:31	2	when we look at storms here we always watch the mid west and see it coming across ride west area <unk> right we watched the mid west and see it coming across or sometimes up from florida and it just seems funny that europe watched 
00:22:31	00:22:39	1	no all the it's like it's coming over from england across spreads it just seems weird to see it going across eight countries the same way here it just would go 
00:22:39	00:22:50	2	across a few state right right [noise] but anyway so they showed storms going through and stuff and and i'm sure that they have japan as well you need to get used to your weather channel so you can tune in and see what the weather is like 
00:22:50	00:22:52	1	i don't know how to find the weather channel 
00:22:52	00:22:56	2	[noise] do you have cable yeah i do then you probably have it i think i

00:28:23	00:28:45	2	i know that's another reason that i don't mind it quite so much just freaky when you realize that you know went dead was you know young or he could you know support a family it's like they said you could support a family on any job if you had a job it would be if you worked in a gas station forever you did if you had a job it was enough money to support yourself mhm 
00:28:45	00:28:47	1	but now of course it's 
00:28:47	00:28:51	2	you know right job means nothing and you could be gone at any minute in this 
00:28:54	00:29:00	2	incomes that didn't used to exist that you know a doctor used to be just somebody who made good money 
00:29:00	00:29:02	1	madison it doesn't value loyalty 
00:29:02	00:29:08	2	or even competitions that much i mean you know i maybe it's i don't know why it is that in <unk>

00:29:21	00:29:22	1	told you as having his yeah 
00:29:22	00:29:29	2	terrible alcoholic and her union is really i think partly the <unk> the fact that she had the least 
00:29:29	00:29:29	1	see with her 
00:29:29	00:29:39	2	union to let this happen is why it happened you know i think if she had had to have a job and had to be sober to go to work she would've been yeah but she was allowed 
00:29:39	00:29:45	1	[noise] through the leniency of this union to take all this time off and all she did with their time office just get drunk and shit 
00:29:45	00:29:50	2	<unk> i think that's true in some cases but i don't think it's true in every case but i do 
00:29:50	00:29:56	1	i i do think that because we've become more or less <unk> too that people you know they they feel that 
00:29:56	00:30:00	2	confidence is not a valid reason to be fired so they sue and
