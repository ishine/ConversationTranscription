00:00:03	00:00:04	2	<unk> right now 
00:00:04	00:00:05	1	yeah 
00:00:17	00:00:21	2	well he had to stop it because he was a mess 
00:00:21	00:00:24	1	you know and this break out on his back was 
00:00:24	00:00:31	2	now until not moments i was afraid that was the <unk> and i met maybe that was significant 
00:00:31	00:00:33	1	no no 
00:00:33	00:00:45	2	and anyway today when i showed it to him he said that was the coming it and i said well how come it stopped one who stopped taking the paint and i said it stops 
00:00:45	00:00:46	1	dry 
00:00:46	00:00:50	2	and you know he's not getting the sweats or anything anymore 
00:00:50	00:00:53	1	and he went into the pain killer 
00:00:53	00:01:08	2	no chrome a dentist abroad center oh and he really needed that because of blood clots yeah but he was taking <unk> which was the pain killer and and because they blood like that i was sure was the <unk> 
00:01:08	00:01:10	1	mm yeah i know 
00:01:10	00:01:17	2	but well anyway i guess no harm one's done um so anyway 
00:01:17	00:01:20	1	the therapist has been wonderful and 
00:01:20	00:01:33	2	she's taught him all the things he [noise] he needed to know like getting on and off the toilet in and out of the shower and yesterday she taught them how to get in and out of the car and you save for you who was in their seventeen 
00:01:33	00:01:34	1	yeah 
00:01:34	00:01:37	2	his leg was so small when he couldn't do half the thing 
00:01:37	00:01:39	1	[noise] see my like before 
00:01:39	00:01:47	2	too yeah but once it's fallen seventeen guys later ah somewhat yeah yeah but not it's not no no not as much yeah 
00:01:47	00:01:50	1	he could barely bend nobody i know oh 
00:01:50	00:01:59	2	supposed to be doing these exercises you know and and he thought he was a failure because he couldn't do them and so when she came she said oh no 
00:01:59	00:02:00	1	yeah 
00:02:00	00:02:08	2	but it's just back off and start all over again you know and we hadn't been improved 
00:02:08	00:02:12	1	for the therapy but she called the office and she got approval 
00:02:12	00:02:26	2	four appointments so that was helpful and uh so today we went to the doctor and he's not the doctor but the decisions assistance and he was very apologetic about our treatment and put then 
00:02:26	00:02:29	1	well you're not mad at me and i said well 
00:02:29	00:02:37	2	the thought occurred to us that if you had told us to head what we need it we would be better equipped to adults 
00:02:37	00:02:39	1	when he came home yeah 
00:02:39	00:02:46	2	and uh he said the hospitals supposed to tell people that <unk> and i said but you see they didn't and if you don't have to tell the system 
00:02:46	00:02:49	1	ethics and we would have had everything set up 
00:02:49	00:02:57	2	i mean i had to run out and get a shower size you know hand held challenge thing oh yeah yeah well i bought two 
00:02:57	00:03:00	1	the first day and then 
00:03:00	00:03:06	2	the um the friend came enhanced or the one that allied shows and 
00:03:06	00:03:11	1	it took him two and a half hours to put it in a chair to check in twenty minutes but everything went wrong 
00:03:11	00:03:24	2	and this was at night and we all used at night and i used to the next day and i said this this piece of junk you know so we had another friend come and take that off in the meantime i bought a water 
00:03:24	00:03:25	1	pick one 
00:03:25	00:03:36	2	and he put that one on and it's worth much better and the store wouldn't have done alley any good for the shower because he needed something with arms on it to push up on 
00:03:37	00:03:42	2	and they <unk> well they had said don't lean over on the <unk> 
00:03:45	00:03:50	2	show and the shower oh oh so uh again 
00:03:50	00:03:51	1	to step up to get in your 
00:03:51	00:03:56	2	no i mean it's a stall sharing you actually stepped down mm 
00:03:56	00:03:57	1	you know but 
00:03:57	00:04:03	2	said you know he needs to sit in there and he needs to have a chair so we can push up on us 
00:04:03	00:04:09	1	arms yeah you know and well actually yesterday 
00:04:35	00:04:38	1	couldn't get his bottom line 
00:04:38	00:04:39	2	i'd like that 
00:04:47	00:04:51	2	so that well at least he has a seat there so he can sit yes yeah 
00:04:51	00:04:55	1	if he needs it you know but all these things if they 
00:04:55	00:05:13	2	oh we've been done and i know where to wyoming on them and we shouldn't but yeah we have that nightmare of the fall so today he said well i'll take an x-ray in two weeks and i looked at him i said to do it today i said what's the point of finding another two weeks to find out if there's been a break or something 
00:05:13	00:05:18	1	you know so uh he said well he said i kept you winning so 
00:05:18	00:05:20	2	today i didn't want you to wait any longer 
00:05:20	00:05:25	1	i said where here [laughter] you know we'll do it so he took the acts 
00:05:25	00:05:29	2	and everything looks fine how's he doing sleeping terrible 
00:05:29	00:05:31	1	leave on his back 
00:05:31	00:05:32	2	to sleep on his back 
00:05:32	00:05:34	1	more weeks yeah mm 
00:05:34	00:05:39	2	and he's going crazy and that was the one you're saying he was hoping they'd say 
00:05:39	00:05:42	1	you can sleep on your side now 
00:05:42	00:05:45	2	i know there's this guy said 
00:05:45	00:05:54	1	i'm telling you what i would tell my father he said don't do it he said other people will tell you your <unk> on your side right now 
00:05:54	00:06:00	2	but he said i'm telling you don't do it because you could throw it out on a whim and now he said you don't know what you're doing when you 
00:06:00	00:06:07	1	i know yeah that's what i did i i got so tired it's yeah but the nurse that had come 
00:06:07	00:06:13	2	yeah she told me i could have always slept on the hip not the other 
00:06:13	00:06:15	1	that's right on the surgical <unk> 
00:06:15	00:06:17	2	i can't imagine doing that 
00:06:17	00:06:18	1	well what he said today 
00:06:18	00:06:20	2	i would have been afraid to sure 
00:06:20	00:06:24	1	what he said today people will tell you you can do that 
00:06:24	00:06:37	2	but he said i am telling you you're putting pressure on that in session you can even open up the in session mm and he said and you don't know what you're doing one you're sleeping and you can turn your head been or something yeah 
00:06:37	00:06:39	1	and then you live longer mhm you know 
00:06:39	00:06:44	2	and the same he's he's nuts eating at the table 
00:06:44	00:06:46	1	because when he sits at the table he has to kind of 
00:06:46	00:06:48	2	yeah to them right 
00:06:48	00:06:51	1	and i said that's an hour 
00:06:51	00:06:51	2	mhm 
00:06:51	00:06:55	1	and so and yet he said he can go out for dinner 
00:06:55	00:07:06	2	yeah see that you're not supposed to have that at a ninety degree angle you're not supposed to have it more than a ninety degree angle no more than ninety 
00:07:10	00:07:13	1	right and you know people think we're nuts 
00:07:13	00:07:24	2	you know people come to visit and i say you can sit here there and they are but you can't sit in those two chairs because of the chairs i always said and yeah and i looked at me like what what difference does it make 
00:07:24	00:07:27	1	you know it makes a lot of difference in the chair 
00:07:30	00:07:38	1	say to put your workout you know and i think what does she badgering him before but he forgets and he pulls that like 
00:07:38	00:07:39	2	and and it is

00:08:11	00:08:15	2	when he sell that did something to my confidence 
00:08:15	00:08:17	1	i'm sure you know

00:08:28	00:08:29	1	<unk> you know mm 
00:08:29	00:08:34	2	and i've never been so nervous as i was that night 
00:08:34	00:08:38	1	well that's enough to scare the life out of <unk> home and have them 
00:08:38	00:08:44	2	all right you know and then all i could think of as if he <unk> something that was nice 
00:08:44	00:08:45	1	yeah

00:09:22	00:09:25	2	you know be among people and everything and 
00:09:25	00:09:26	1	that's because she needs that 
00:09:26	00:09:34	2	she could this person can never stay home five minutes uh but i don't need to add i can't tell you the last time i've been in the <unk> 
00:09:34	00:09:36	1	he doesn't want to go out oh no 
00:09:36	00:09:43	2	[laughter] it was terrifying at the doctor's today because the little kids were running around and the money 
00:09:43	00:09:45	1	or the crutches 
00:09:45	00:09:55	2	ah he was using the walker and then um monday the nursing and therapist encourage them to try the crutches uh-huh 
00:09:55	00:09:56	1	and so 
00:09:56	00:09:59	2	today he is the crutches going to the doctor so 
00:09:59	00:10:02	1	because it was easier mm 
00:10:02	00:10:07	2	the doctor's office no matter where you park you have a long walk 
00:10:07	00:10:12	1	[noise] to the door because they have like a courtyard 
00:10:26	00:10:28	2	this is <unk> 
00:10:31	00:10:45	2	and um and then when we went to pull into the parking place some dude in your own the handicapped parking place he had taken up to places where the ramp was a young kid 
00:10:45	00:10:45	1	mhm 
00:10:45	00:10:55	2	and i said uh boy i hope he cuts in that car one on out here 'cause i'm gonna give him a pace in my mind but i was parking the car when he got in and took off you know 
00:10:58	00:11:01	2	but anyway he is to practice going and coming i had to walk 
00:11:21	00:11:23	1	to where the socks for another week 
00:11:23	00:11:33	2	during the day he told me to get vitamin e. and break it up and put it on and says and that helps inhaling a day and says 
00:11:33	00:11:35	1	mhm and 
00:11:35	00:11:36	2	and um 
00:11:47	00:11:49	1	but the therapists uh 
00:11:49	00:11:55	2	like three months from now or even six months from now if you take an x. ray you can 
00:11:55	00:11:57	1	say that the body is still healing 
00:11:57	00:12:07	2	and she said you don't see it with a naked on and said what the answer and i meant to ask the fellow i used to be an x ray technician but i don't 
00:12:07	00:12:10	1	where would you seen that 
00:12:10	00:12:14	2	where would you say the handling in the bottom you know i know

00:12:21	00:12:29	2	and it did they show too before um yeah and they didn't show you they have to know how interesting 
00:12:34	00:12:42	2	[laughter] so he's going to <unk> um we're back to laugh and 
00:12:42	00:12:44	1	[noise] um

00:15:42	00:15:47	2	and he said he can't tell them you know because he's so cautious still 
00:15:56	00:15:58	1	that's the hour i didn't have 
00:15:58	00:16:02	2	pain you had pain alley 
00:16:02	00:16:03	1	it before 
00:16:03	00:16:10	2	no he had momentary pain sharp shoot pain but it wasn't most of the time 
00:16:10	00:16:16	1	and but what was happening i only is it was like going under him 
00:16:19	00:16:25	1	and that he was scared to death of that because he thought i am going to fool and kill months so 
00:16:25	00:16:31	2	yeah you know and we'd be walking along the next thing i know he sort of drop down yeah 
00:16:31	00:16:33	1	and that's when i said to him you gotta use

00:16:40	00:16:44	1	which is that right yeah mine was too 
00:16:44	00:16:54	2	and so the the right knee they're hoping will improve now that it's not going to have so much stress put on and and then the therapists

00:16:57	00:16:58	2	uh-huh

00:17:12	00:17:13	1	mhm

00:17:16	00:17:18	1	that it's a different 
00:17:18	00:17:25	2	yeah you can't do this as it gets feeling better you know he'll just find that you you just walk on it and think no more
