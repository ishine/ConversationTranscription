00:00:27	00:00:32	2	hi audrey <unk> oh i see that's why we have fifteen that's 'cause we're going to do for two phone calls 
00:00:32	00:00:40	1	well it depends we have to see if he can do it or not because when we first when we first found out about it we didn't realize it only one person can talk to one person 
00:00:40	00:00:46	2	[noise] and then they told me only one person to one person we have half an hour but i have to at least talk to you for fifteen minutes 
00:00:46	00:00:47	1	[noise] so 
00:00:47	00:00:53	2	uh-huh and they're going to give us a one minute warning before we have to hang up so we have one minute but i'd hang up 
00:00:55	00:01:05	2	i'm fine i'm fine how are you i haven't talked to you in a long time i feel like i've talked i talked with david almost every day [laughter] 
00:01:05	00:01:07	1	[laughter] isn't that wild [laughter] 
00:01:07	00:01:20	2	i don't know what is it there's really no difference between between writing a letter and and the way we correspond matter of fact but i do is they sit down and write a letter at my own leisure you know the word processor and then late at night i 
00:01:20	00:01:21	1	send it over 
00:01:28	00:01:30	1	well you know what i don't know sometimes 
00:01:30	00:01:33	2	that's easier i don't know how to explain it 
00:01:33	00:01:36	1	that you saw in the email is easier 
00:01:36	00:01:41	2	yeah it's i guess that it's no different except that you don't have to go out and get stamps and put it in the mailbox 
00:01:41	00:01:57	1	i think also that you know that someone's going to be reading it the next day not possibly in a week you know that you know that when they're saying it's gonna be hard sometimes when you write a letter you figure eventually they're going to get this and it's always gonna be old news and you know this it's more of a communicate you feel like you're really communicating 
00:01:57	00:02:05	2	email kind of even though it's even though there is a delay but i don't know it's like cute [laughter] i get i get a kick out of pressing all those buttons and everything 
00:02:05	00:02:09	1	[noise] so tell me okay first of all you have to start up tell me about all your kids 
00:02:09	00:02:16	2	[laughter] i wonder if the beginning we should i'm although at the end okay he's very cute yeah 
00:02:16	00:02:18	1	he's like um 
00:02:18	00:02:36	2	he's nine months old already [laughter] believe it or not [laughter] see doing tell me not really like [noise] he's only like seven months old right but the truth is like all my children really only like five months [laughter] lump on a law [laughter] i would 
00:02:36	00:02:38	1	very alert 
00:02:38	00:02:46	2	he's very alert and um and very responsive and laugh and eats well hello 
00:02:46	00:02:49	1	oh i'm here i'm just doing it in about what can i hate that <unk> thing 
00:02:49	00:02:50	2	okay uh 
00:02:50	00:02:51	1	and um but he doesn't 
00:02:51	00:02:56	2	oh okay well that's normal you're not worried about that that's all you're okay 
00:02:56	00:02:58	1	because he was premature he's getting 
00:02:58	00:03:09	2	of attention right so we go to physical therapy once a week and the truth is what i'm learning about it oh because i spend so much time with the little therapist is it all my kids could of you [laughter] 
00:03:09	00:03:13	1	[laughter] 
00:03:13	00:03:32	2	does he get all use is there because we all make us more balanced people between the writing or left him his fears and something about being organized internally gets you organized <unk> i i've learned a lot i don't know half of it is probably the <unk> but if any if it's true they all need it [laughter] [laughter] in a very young 
00:03:32	00:03:34	1	how often do they don't like 
00:03:34	00:03:38	2	how do you think um i'm sorry once a week okay once a week 
00:03:38	00:03:41	1	mhm um and 
00:03:41	00:03:54	2	she doesn't like to play on his stomach yellow likes to be on his back right so as soon as you put 'em on a he can he can lift his head and everything and and now he's starting to extend his hands out even right but he just as soon as a gift that toys just rolls over the place 
00:03:54	00:03:59	1	<unk> oh no no but they they were all like that every <unk> every one of them 
00:04:07	00:04:15	2	right but i see that that no but it's helping mhm it's helping him be more he's advancing better i think right who knows

00:04:26	00:04:28	1	you got this coffee 
00:04:39	00:04:42	1	right but but but because it's 
00:04:42	00:04:53	2	things usually return and that usually as a condition you know they prepared me for that and i know but but there's millions of kids here have it right of kids and a lot of a game a lot of <unk> get it but you haven't had another attack 
00:04:53	00:04:56	1	so it was it's also

00:07:28	00:07:30	2	i i 
00:07:30	00:07:32	1	it's unbelievable 
00:07:32	00:07:39	2	first of all i'm i'm upset about what happened i'm upset now i'm upset i wasn't upset so much when it happened because that i took 
00:07:39	00:07:48	1	at the time i was just taking everything in stride and everything you know gums autobahn and everything will be okay because i was in the baby was still in the hospital mhm and i and i you know i was still 
00:07:48	00:07:53	2	from uh well you're not working really hard or you know i'm working 
00:07:53	00:07:55	1	[noise] the one [noise] 
00:08:02	00:08:04	1	mhm 
00:08:12	00:08:14	1	<unk> mhm 
00:08:14	00:08:20	2	i think it's more it's more suitable to my personality into it's my my personality professional 
00:08:20	00:08:23	1	not professionally as well as financially mhm 
00:08:23	00:08:24	2	i just think 
00:08:32	00:08:34	1	right and um i don't 
00:08:34	00:08:42	2	i enjoy the flexibility of working at home and working when i want and things like that but i don't enjoy the pressure of it like you can 
00:08:46	00:08:51	2	and i have no problem you know ignoring the laundry right and ignoring the kids and working 
00:08:51	00:08:55	1	i just i just don't like it's just not it's just not suitable to me 
00:09:08	00:09:10	1	business thing their clients 
00:09:10	00:09:23	2	right and you're like you have to try to act mature your kids are screaming and the other room and you like have to pretend that nothing's <unk> you know and you really want to be in the other room settling what's going on but you have to drop everything whenever you never know it's like there's a bomb 
00:09:24	00:09:29	2	but you can't ever and i buy i'd rather not the room i'd rather just be on the phone with a client right 
00:09:29	00:09:37	1	no you also to never relaxed because as soon as you sit down to read a book or do anything you're thinking well i really could should be doing this or you know 
00:09:37	00:09:49	2	whatever i don't have that problem cause i don't have the study i don't have a steady inflow of work either mhm it comes and goes and it's not i don't have that many i don't have that many things and i have to wait for people to refer 'em and i have to go get them 
00:09:50	00:10:02	2	i don't and i and i and as much as as many times i go over every decision that i made along the way even though the last three years and every decision was the right decision at the right time i mean it wasn't anything i did 
00:10:02	00:10:02	1	mhm 
00:10:12	00:10:14	1	mhm 
00:10:18	00:10:20	1	three hours a day it really was 
00:10:20	00:10:24	2	but i didn't want to give it up because it wasn't so much money it was i was i was trying to see if this was some 
00:10:24	00:10:26	1	think i could really do mhm 
00:10:26	00:10:28	2	if i liked it and if i was good at it 
00:10:28	00:10:30	1	and then and when the 
00:10:30	00:10:31	2	we wanted to have another baby 
00:10:31	00:10:33	1	mhm and 
00:10:33	00:10:43	2	and we figured oh you know and so one of the work more he wanted to invest more in his um in in in his career right so we figured our plan a very you know 
00:10:43	00:10:48	1	best laid plans right mhm and the truth is our plans came better than they could have 
00:11:06	00:11:07	1	mhm 
00:11:07	00:11:11	2	and so it would be able to invest in his career because i'd be home with oh it'd be 
00:11:11	00:11:20	1	more mhm in the end though i mean those things but not happen and they didn't happen as quickly as they used to happen and we all those all those things together and 
00:11:20	00:11:28	2	someone offered me while i was freelancing offered me to join them mhm that's what i did accept and less fall right and of course right after that i became 
00:11:28	00:11:31	1	<unk> mhm and the rest of the 
00:11:31	00:11:42	2	<unk> but what happened was in that year that i worked there mhm gave up my old job i developed a i've never been for fun nice portfolio right which i probably i could not have accomplished 
00:11:42	00:11:44	1	and um attorney leave right 
00:11:44	00:11:49	2	because i got really good projects and it was a a wide variety of <unk> and i have something to show now right 
00:11:49	00:11:51	1	so 
00:11:51	00:12:09	2	on the one hand we accomplished our goals and feel really invested in this during that time that i worked i was working two at two days a week from home and two days a week from my office in tel aviv and i really was home more in phil started to teach and he started he was working three jobs and and much happier and so everyone got everyone really did accomplish there 
00:12:09	00:12:10	1	yeah 
00:12:10	00:12:15	2	the only problem was after the baby was born and well and then all of the <unk> gone that happened before 
00:12:15	00:12:15	1	right 
00:12:15	00:12:22	2	yeah i didn't have a safe as a safe a job so to speak to come home too mhm 
00:12:22	00:12:26	1	so what are your options now what kind of jobs are available to you 
00:12:26	00:12:36	2	well i <unk> i went through a long interview process for two job jobs right as a marketing communication's writer and i didn't get either one 
00:12:36	00:12:38	1	one one happened 
00:12:38	00:12:41	2	anybody yet <unk> they want to get someone who 
00:12:41	00:12:44	1	what happens in with his high tech companies is there's a big learning 
00:12:44	00:12:50	2	curved to learn the technology and stuff and they want to try to find someone who's been writing in this pool in this area 
00:12:50	00:12:53	1	right they don't think it exists but they're still looking for 
00:12:53	00:12:59	2	while they're using someone who left them it's a freelancer mhm another one they picked someone else i think when i was very interested in 
00:12:59	00:13:04	1	mhm and others and so i'm still looking for as an answering and trying to drum up some business 
00:13:04	00:13:07	2	oh so do you want to work full time 
00:13:16	00:13:17	1	hi i'm good 
00:13:17	00:13:20	2	i'm not good at it mhm 
00:13:20	00:13:21	1	you're not going to read um 
00:13:21	00:13:23	2	being home 
00:13:23	00:13:25	1	[laughter] 
00:13:25	00:13:30	2	god i'm really not i hate cooking and cleaning i hate housework right 
00:13:30	00:13:33	1	i like the kids still about noon and that's it 
00:13:50	00:14:00	2	well i know you're not far more are there are other mothers that are home with your home no not really i think that's part of the problem though for you personally too i mean if you're the only one home it's <unk> it really is 
00:14:00	00:14:03	1	there's no adult to talk to 
00:14:03	00:14:06	2	well people work you know as teacher is a lot of teachers that work here 
00:14:06	00:14:12	1	and like my neighbor they you know they say she works in the morning and her family you know 
00:14:12	00:14:17	2	the atomic tree practice but i don't know people of bit dizzy and i just 
00:14:17	00:14:19	1	busy right 
00:14:19	00:14:25	2	what did they started auto auto i would be doing something else 
00:14:25	00:14:34	1	being their plans i'm not taking a full maternity leave in even getting back to work i wanted to work when i was in the hospital mhm work was like everything not everything to me but it was important 
00:14:41	00:14:53	2	really so sad it's like it was bound to happen it would have happened then it would have happened later it would have whatever mhm this is really bad to have been i think i was like knocked over when i was down 
00:14:53	00:14:57	1	and they don't there's no opening there for you now they filled your place 
00:14:57	00:15:13	2	no no not at all they do not like a big company it was is uh you know two women mhm who'd been working together for fifteen years and it's like a private you know it's uh let's see what i'm doing at home but they do it a little bit more you know it was two of them they never had a secretaries and mhm but they had an office 
00:15:13	00:15:27	1	right and um when she asked me to join them was the first time that she was the first time in her career that they were going to expand because until then it was basically a living for her and so the person and um 
00:15:27	00:15:30	2	and they get all the funeral so why don't they want you 
00:15:30	00:15:35	1	[noise] well [noise] in september [noise] when i went to the hospital 
00:15:35	00:15:50	2	figure a third of the office just vanished right so they had to we organize and they just once and they are older and they're sitting there ways <unk> once they just reorganize back to the way it was it was just easier to keep on going that way and they scaled back a little bit and they just wanted to go back to running the business 
00:15:51	00:16:01	2	she had these expansion plants was she was sort of [noise] i knew it partially but i didn't know what the ramifications or be she was going through like a second awakening effort or 
00:16:01	00:16:03	1	divorce mhm 
00:16:03	00:16:12	2	never needed to advertise she had enough business strictly for referrals she just wanted to see what would happen if she actually went out marketed herself she they'd never needed to do that 
00:16:12	00:16:13	1	right and the problem 
00:16:13	00:16:26	2	to do it when he needed more people mhm or use more freelancers and she just so it wasn't as profitable it was as she thought it would be although it wasn't supposed to be i mean we agreed that i wish you wouldn't make any money on me for at least six months or so because i 
00:16:26	00:16:28	1	learning right 
00:16:32	00:16:40	1	<unk> and she was starting to get scared and financially in trouble she not only the she hire me and especially also upgraded i mean she had to 
00:16:40	00:16:51	2	i._b._m. original p._c.s mhm i mean no one more those anymore <unk> you know she bought thirty thousand dollars in a computer equipment and expanded the office at all came together 
00:16:51	00:16:54	1	right and 
00:16:54	00:17:02	2	well i think it'll all be for good because like you said you got the experience that you wouldn't have gotten elsewhere and now you just have to write for the wait for the right thing to come along 
00:17:02	00:17:08	1	yeah look when it happened itself i mean <unk> in the hospital and i also said it's you know i need a i needed a time to recover 
00:17:08	00:17:11	2	from what had happened mhm because it's so it took a while 
00:17:11	00:17:20	1	mhm i mean that's i sold dream about his birth <unk> less frequently but i still do mhm it was still very we was with me for a really long time 
00:17:20	00:17:26	2	none of that way but it's like it's there it's like the exhaust chairs from uh the whole time 
00:17:26	00:17:28	1	right and now it and 
00:17:28	00:17:39	2	when i started to like when i was home i just we did my resume i wanted to just put out feelers and i didn't even know if i take work 'cause she was going to give me she's used me as a freelancer i work for work for her but as um 
00:17:39	00:17:40	1	oh yeah um 
00:17:40	00:17:46	2	independently and i was thinking you know maybe it's there'll be enough worked from that and i'll just stay home what do i need to to travel 
00:17:46	00:17:49	1	before work forty five hours a week sixty hour weeks 
00:17:58	00:17:59	1	my resume but i was only doing it 
00:17:59	00:18:11	2	put out feelers and and i got responses i got invited for interviews mhm but they just didn't come up anything and then already i started <unk> what am i can't rely on this and this i'm real now i really want the jobs you know it was it was a change in my own mindset 
00:18:11	00:18:13	1	well did you need the money i'm in 
00:18:13	00:18:26	2	like right now but we will yeah mhm i will be okay right you won't be you won't because i thank god i mean feel really developed a lot of things while while i worked that year mhm by her 
00:18:26	00:18:28	1	gotcha gotcha 
00:18:28	00:18:35	2	i guess that's what we accomplished all of our goals even though we had the baby later than we wanted to but um anyway that's it 
00:18:35	00:18:41	1	alright so let me start over them with your kids i interrupted you before okay so go on
