00:00:00	00:00:03	1	so did you just hear that message 
00:00:03	00:00:06	2	yes they did but i'm no no no i don't have a british accent 
00:00:06	00:00:14	1	right i actually have to call someone who has an american accent who is living outside of the united states 
00:00:14	00:00:22	2	all right good of the things they what they want they want american accent uh for their database 
00:00:22	00:00:23	1	i also could have uh 
00:00:23	00:00:29	2	gone if i was a native spanish speaker are native camel speaker or they have this whole 
00:00:29	00:00:35	1	of languages but both people on the line have to have the same native 
00:00:35	00:00:41	2	alright unfair so uh yeah it's kind of an odd thing but in any case 
00:00:41	00:00:42	1	so so 
00:00:42	00:01:02	2	so so so do you have to say anything in particular or just do the night i just had to get your permission to order and after that uh basically what they want is whatever we happen to be saying so that they can get random bit you know the idea is to get random bits of speech for this and for some reason 
00:01:02	00:01:03	1	[noise] they want 
00:01:03	00:01:06	2	some of it uh they asked 
00:01:06	00:01:08	1	have three different programs 
00:01:08	00:01:19	2	and uh one of them involved uh you have to call within the united states in one of them you have to call outside the united states and 
00:01:19	00:01:32	1	well well this this is an extremely good line um because often times you get a satellite line which would be very very uh uh choppy et cetera so i i wonder if they're trying to do speech recognition over over phone lines and that sort of 
00:01:32	00:01:39	2	that that's part of what they're trying to do is than it is they want to work on speech recognition and uh 
00:01:39	00:01:40	1	lee um 
00:01:40	00:01:43	2	also on digitizing speech 
00:01:54	00:01:56	1	this is just happens to be 
00:01:56	00:01:58	2	first time that uh 
00:01:58	00:01:58	1	because 
00:02:12	00:02:15	2	right right and it didn't work and then 
00:02:15	00:02:27	1	uh i just happened to still be up at this point and i said well see if i can get through on the eight hundred number now and i did well [noise] so anyway how are you doing these days 
00:02:27	00:02:43	2	things are going very well i think i had mentioned before that um that uh that uh that there's a company now that i'm working with um ah which is very much just just myself in <unk> um that um <unk> oh okay okay 
00:02:43	00:02:51	1	well to me that you were leaving the company that you were at and you were entertaining offers and uh well well it seemed to me 
00:02:51	00:03:02	2	since since i had a clams to to just kind of set up my own company of sorts [noise] so um so things are going extremely well so i had one client who said that he picked me a minimum amount 
00:03:02	00:03:04	1	he he uh there'll be a minimum uh 
00:03:04	00:03:14	2	i have about a a day a week for the next two three years which is sufficient to pay all my bills and so i decided that it would make sense to do this and um 
00:03:33	00:03:35	1	this year oh well that's 
00:03:35	00:03:40	2	good to be a few months oh yeah i remember you talking a little bit about it at one 
00:03:56	00:04:00	1	uh <unk> uh i 
00:04:00	00:04:07	2	the main reason for that is i had not really anticipate it a few expenses that recently came up uh 
00:04:07	00:04:10	1	related to a couple of burglaries that i had 
00:04:10	00:04:12	2	oh gosh 
00:04:12	00:04:17	1	yeah yeah but yeah not a whole lot i can do about that now 
00:04:17	00:04:18	2	indeed 
00:04:18	00:04:20	1	do you have to deal with the situation and 
00:04:20	00:04:22	2	so that's what i'm doing 
00:04:22	00:04:24	1	but um 
00:04:26	00:04:47	2	one of the main reasons that i've been such a pathetic er correspond and has been work i've actually been doing a lot of it oh wow i turned in my masters thesis back in may and i'm actually presently working on um several uh articles 
00:04:47	00:04:49	1	oh okay impressive 
00:04:49	00:05:01	2	yeah actually it turns out that one thing one little bit in what i was doing uh is going to turn out to be very important in the end and uh 
00:05:04	00:05:18	2	see the one very annoying thing about all this was my advisors been in france for a year and a half yeah and this made writing my thesis very annoying because there wasn't much discussion yeah yeah um 
00:05:18	00:05:21	1	[noise] anyway i had been 
00:05:21	00:05:34	2	kind of telling him that you know from my reading literature i thought that this one little alteration i had made in my model was kind of clever and unique [laughter] and it 
00:05:34	00:05:35	1	made 
00:05:36	00:05:37	1	one type 
00:05:37	00:05:45	2	solution occur which was seen experimentally but none of the other models had uh had 
00:05:45	00:05:47	1	yeah they basically 
00:05:58	00:05:59	1	if you look at 
00:05:59	00:06:07	2	total intensity uh-huh delays or you get a <unk> which is characterize by one frequency 
00:06:13	00:06:15	1	and <unk> one of those 
00:06:19	00:06:31	2	happening is that the modes er <unk> out of phase so that they completely mask each other's exactly awesome lesions on these other frequencies and uh 
00:06:31	00:06:34	2	you can with uh pretty 
00:06:44	00:06:46	1	you can't find so that it will sustain 
00:06:46	00:06:48	2	oh okay yeah so 
00:07:04	00:07:05	1	so um 
00:07:05	00:07:18	2	i found a simple modification of the original formula which unfortunately makes the solutions horrendously nasty and in most cases ah in soluble 
00:07:21	00:07:23	2	[laughter] oh 
00:07:23	00:07:31	1	it actually it creates a situation where you get the right sort of answer you just can't always write that down very easily 
00:07:31	00:07:40	2	exactly oh wow so so so so you're you're pushing forward the bounds of theoretical leaves her knees or whatever it is science 
00:07:40	00:07:46	1	which um is kind of interesting considering that that's not really my thing 
00:07:46	00:07:48	2	[laughter] indeed 
00:07:48	00:07:52	1	being an experimental is not a theorist but um 
00:07:52	00:07:57	2	oh wow oh impressive <unk> so are you going to get an article in nature or something 
00:07:57	00:07:58	1	[noise] um 
00:07:58	00:07:59	2	actually 
00:08:00	00:08:03	2	i'm not sure if we're shooting for 
00:08:13	00:08:18	2	i don't think it's quite that significant would be <unk> letters 
00:08:18	00:08:18	1	mhm 
00:08:18	00:08:24	2	but uh we want to write a letter and then a couple articles 
00:08:24	00:08:25	1	yeah 
00:08:25	00:08:33	2	[noise] and i i don't know how much you know about scientific literature but letters are much more prestigious then article 
00:08:33	00:08:34	1	mhm 
00:08:34	00:08:36	2	oh okay oh i didn't realize that 
00:08:36	00:08:49	1	yeah so that that's why it's actually a big deal as i you know writing a couple of articles based on your masters thesis is not at all unusual and physics and uh 
00:08:49	00:08:58	2	it's the fact that i would be writing a letter that is the impressive part of it all and what's actually kind of interesting is i kept telling meal that i saw 
00:08:58	00:09:00	1	that this was kind of significant 
00:09:00	00:09:07	2	and they'll kept writing back that i should tone in this part of the thesis down 
00:09:07	00:09:11	1	[noise] people have been seeing that you know people <unk> 
00:09:11	00:09:21	2	and it's true they do in the transients and i was having a lot of trouble getting across to him that all of the literature isn't has this frequency and the transit 
00:09:21	00:09:22	1	yeah 
00:09:22	00:09:38	2	not driven and uh what happened was after i had turned in my ceases but before i saw uh neil again he went to a conference in rochester and there this was a big issue among the people who were 
00:09:38	00:09:43	1	doing this work was that they're models couldn't show this as a driven 
00:09:43	00:09:44	2	frequency yet <unk> 
00:09:44	00:09:46	1	it showed it [laughter] 
00:09:46	00:09:47	2	frequent 
00:09:47	00:09:49	1	oh cool and so neil 
00:10:01	00:10:07	2	cool that's cool that's mostly the sort of stuff that i'm spending a lot of time on now 
00:10:07	00:10:13	1	well it'll look good on your <unk> your resume so so you might as well spend the time 
00:10:13	00:10:17	2	yes well uh no it's definitely worth doing 
00:10:17	00:10:17	1	hum 
00:10:17	00:10:28	2	[noise] and i would have been spending more time on it if it weren't for ah dealing with the burglary issue you know yeah i've been dealing with so are you still living in the house in the middle of the park yes 
00:10:28	00:10:31	1	okay yeah i know the thing is that 
00:10:31	00:10:39	2	place is incredibly easy to break into if you want to it's not a question of whether or not uh 
00:10:45	00:10:46	1	exactly exactly 
00:10:53	00:10:54	1	well it's kind of 
00:10:54	00:11:07	2	god they've stolen very weird things for the most part as far yeah it's like the first time they broke in the what they stole was just bizarre mostly 
00:11:07	00:11:09	1	worthless stuff 
00:11:10	00:11:12	2	yeah uh-huh 
00:11:12	00:11:14	1	the most worthwhile 
00:11:14	00:11:31	2	thing as far as monetary value went that they stole was the pre amplifier of my stereo unfortunately because it's a nice pre amplifier it has an off board power supply which they didn't steal [noise] which makes the thing that they stole absolutely worthless 
00:11:31	00:11:32	1	mhm 
00:11:32	00:11:33	1	huh 
00:11:33	00:11:35	2	mhm 
00:11:46	00:11:50	2	uh which was actually where the major problem kane 
00:11:50	00:11:52	1	exactly exactly 
00:11:52	00:12:02	2	i suddenly had no transportation and so i then had to go bike hunting and eventually get another bike and then that cost me a lot of time 
00:12:02	00:12:04	1	yeah yeah exactly 
00:12:04	00:12:13	2	spending a lot of time hunting for bikes and then getting one purchased and then having to go get it and things like that 
00:12:13	00:12:13	1	but 
00:12:13	00:12:16	2	[noise] that's dealt with at least in so 
00:12:27	00:12:46	2	[noise] during the summer i can actually uh according to the stipulations of my grant or my fellowship i can actually earn money during the summer so [laughter] okay [laughter] that's an advantage is that i'm allowed to earn money now at least 
00:12:46	00:12:57	1	oh god um what what what are they want you're not earning money while you're um but i i suppose that they they just wanted to get a ticket all your time to the education and yeah 
00:13:06	00:13:14	2	stipend and therefore you know i should be living off of that and spending my time doing my work they'd rather than uh 
00:13:14	00:13:15	1	mhm 
00:13:15	00:13:17	1	and working it 
00:13:17	00:13:23	2	something to gain money so [noise] yeah that's part of the agreement is that i'm not supposed to work 
00:13:23	00:13:24	1	then yeah but 
00:13:24	00:13:40	2	um actually something that i found out this year that i wish i'd known last year that was interesting and i guess i haven't really told you about this one is that um it turns out that the educational grant part of my 
00:13:40	00:13:41	1	ship mhm 
00:13:41	00:13:43	2	it's supposed to go toward tuition 
00:13:54	00:13:56	1	i uh have been 
00:14:05	00:14:07	1	oh okay yep yep yep 
00:14:07	00:14:14	2	and all this extra money to expend [noise] and so actually i guess yeah i hadn't 
00:14:14	00:14:16	1	uh i didn't have 
00:14:16	00:14:19	2	computer last time that i would have 
00:14:19	00:14:22	1	uh talk to and uh so 
00:14:22	00:14:27	2	oh do you do you have an internet address 'cause uh 'cause we've got an internet link up here 
00:14:27	00:14:28	1	oh you finally do 
00:14:28	00:14:31	2	oh yeah well it wasn't it wasn't anything i did but um 
00:14:31	00:14:34	1	i have two of them all right well let's hear them 
00:14:34	00:14:39	2	uh the best one to use would be l. carson 
00:14:39	00:14:43	2	oh person okay at 
00:14:43	00:14:45	1	c. c. dot 
00:14:56	00:14:58	2	dot <unk> where are you 
00:14:58	00:15:01	1	that'd be the uh 
00:15:01	00:15:02	2	and britain or <unk> uh 
00:15:02	00:15:03	1	space between them no 
00:15:03	00:15:09	2	<unk> if you had 'em anything with internet uh well it was the one who does all that stuff 
00:15:09	00:15:16	1	yeah well the thing is that um every other country in the world will end with the country code ah well of course 
00:15:28	00:15:33	1	where they're from yeah so uh that's an educational 
00:15:33	00:15:37	2	one exactly as opposed to commercial government or who knows but not to dance 
00:15:46	00:15:50	2	some sort that those 
00:15:50	00:15:52	1	seldom actually have a person that 
00:15:52	00:15:53	2	uh-huh 
00:15:53	00:15:55	1	i don't think any of those too 
00:15:55	00:15:56	2	i'm not sure 
00:15:56	00:15:58	1	interesting but um 
00:16:01	00:16:04	1	you know send you a junk mail over the internet now 
00:16:15	00:16:22	2	what's your internet a drive see underscore nelson 
00:16:22	00:16:26	1	see under score nelson 
00:16:26	00:16:29	2	uh-huh 
00:16:29	00:16:32	2	b._b._c. and see 
00:16:32	00:16:35	1	maybe see and see 
00:16:35	00:16:36	1	dot org 
00:16:36	00:16:37	2	yeah 
00:16:38	00:16:39	1	uh-huh 
00:16:39	00:16:41	2	dot u. k. 
00:16:44	00:16:47	2	yes i i recognized the u._k. 
00:16:47	00:16:51	1	oh indeed indeed if the country it's one over here in uh in europe 
00:16:51	00:16:53	2	yes well we're kind of 
00:16:53	00:16:55	1	see the country 
00:16:55	00:17:09	2	well it's it's interesting because org and um uh an ac for academic i i know they use their and a lot of other countries don't even use that 
00:17:09	00:17:09	1	mhm 
00:17:09	00:17:16	2	you'll just have you know it'll be something dot i._t. in italy 
00:17:16	00:17:18	1	oh okay yeah yeah they want 
00:17:18	00:17:24	2	even have an extra code to tell you anything about the place yeah <unk> uh sending too 
00:17:24	00:17:27	2	but england seems to be pretty <unk> 
00:17:27	00:17:31	1	stood about having an extra code in there so that 
00:17:31	00:17:39	2	similar to most of us okay you can forget what it is yeah uh do you do 
00:17:39	00:17:43	1	guys have full access to the worldwide web as well or 
00:17:43	00:17:44	2	oh yes yes 
00:17:44	00:17:49	1	so um suckers go surfing all over the place pulse paintings out of the loop and all that sort of stuff 
00:17:49	00:17:57	2	yeah that's uh that's another one of the things that my uh educational grants is paying for for me 
00:17:57	00:17:59	1	oh indeed indeed 
00:17:59	00:18:12	2	through bryn mawr i don't have worldwide web access so i bought that on my own which is why i have i i do have another email address but i seldom checked the mail there so it's kind of better to just send it to burn more 
00:18:12	00:18:13	1	mhm 
00:18:13	00:18:21	2	well i had been i've read a book and i was in the midst of writing a letter but it takes forever to finish letters sometimes um by uh 
00:18:25	00:18:27	1	some woman who got her 
00:18:30	00:18:33	1	and then i went to the ducks 
00:18:33	00:18:57	2	in philosophy from harvard and now she lives over in england and she talks about um uh i'm going to kind of ruined the book but she talks about um <unk> uh content state and um how you can use those in in some form um if you wanted to as a basis for consciousness and then having er states based on top of 
00:18:57	00:18:59	1	so um 
00:19:02	00:19:03	1	uh 
00:19:23	00:19:25	1	she she does a little bit 
00:19:25	00:19:27	2	and also this guy was a complete cynic 
00:19:27	00:19:29	1	um he was 
00:19:29	00:19:36	2	he was the most he was a pure atheist and it was just depressing to uh speak to them 
00:19:36	00:19:44	1	they asked him well why don't you commit suicide yet i think any thought about it on time and he said something like <unk> well i enjoy i enjoy what i'm doing at work 
00:19:50	00:19:52	1	[laughter] 
00:19:52	00:19:58	2	so so i i i i asked him the right question um by accident i <unk> 
00:19:58	00:19:59	1	what was it 
00:19:59	00:20:01	2	i think have you made a double particle yet 
00:20:01	00:20:03	1	and he said 
00:20:20	00:20:21	1	mhm 
00:20:21	00:20:34	2	i don't know enough to be of a whole lot of help their uh don't really know a huge amount about particle physics uh sounds a bit specialized yeah 
00:20:34	00:20:35	1	trying to remember 
00:20:35	00:20:38	2	what the guy's name is um 
00:20:38	00:20:39	1	mhm 
00:20:39	00:20:44	2	oh oh <unk> yeah roger penn rose that's who it is 
00:20:44	00:20:44	1	mhm 
00:20:44	00:20:46	2	[noise] um 
00:20:46	00:20:48	2	he uh 
00:20:48	00:20:49	1	has been 
00:20:49	00:20:53	2	working recently on a uh 
00:20:54	00:20:56	1	system whereby 
00:21:03	00:21:04	1	right 
00:21:04	00:21:15	2	and uh he believes that he's found a way because one of the big problems with that whole idea is that uh 
00:21:15	00:21:25	1	<unk> the whole the whole object of this is the multiple calculations can be carried out simultaneously by using super positions 
00:21:36	00:21:37	1	[noise] 
00:21:37	00:21:43	2	the big problem is that you can't really get the brain 
00:21:43	00:21:45	1	to do that because 
00:21:45	00:21:46	2	to maintain 
00:21:46	00:21:48	1	super positions 
00:21:48	00:21:52	2	means that no measurement as possible 
00:21:52	00:21:53	1	but 
00:21:53	00:22:07	2	yeah brain is so noisy that things are continuously getting bombarded with photons that can carry out the measurement and since the measurement doesn't have to be actually done it just has to be possible to screw up the super position 
00:22:07	00:22:09	1	yeah yeah you don't 
00:22:09	00:22:22	2	have anywhere that you can actually set these up and uh he and his doctor have come up with an idea of how you could do that and 
00:22:22	00:22:24	1	is um 
00:22:25	00:22:27	1	what do you call them 
00:22:27	00:22:28	2	[laughter] 
00:22:28	00:22:35	1	<unk> with phone on inside of um <unk> in cells 
00:22:35	00:22:36	2	mhm 
00:22:36	00:22:42	1	and so uh it's been a while since i read this but i remember thinking oh i should tell eric 
00:22:46	00:22:55	1	send you um i'll send you let it eventually and i'll i'll reference what the book as i would the reason that i like to this because it was she was reasonably regrets 
00:22:55	00:23:02	2	from the scientific <unk> part i mean there were no formulas or anything in it um and and i don't really care about details like that 
00:23:02	00:23:04	1	but um but she being 
00:23:04	00:23:13	2	uh for lots of i guess it was before so i guess it was it was like psychology and religion there was some some really weird um combination 
00:23:13	00:23:14	1	physics and i'm i'm thinking 
00:23:25	00:23:32	2	look at um ah humans and how they interact and how they behave um you know and then 
00:23:32	00:23:35	1	and she'd go through and she discuss something and say on this 
00:23:35	00:23:42	2	is understanding you know 'cause the current theory and then uh you know human psychology such and so and and this kind of mattress and 
00:23:42	00:23:44	1	[noise] you know so so so she takes from the standpoint of 
00:23:44	00:23:50	2	consciousness has to have you have to have these <unk> sort of principles that needs to have um 
00:23:51	00:23:53	1	people who 
00:24:03	00:24:06	2	in a sense so we don't think in sort of individual little you know 
00:24:06	00:24:11	1	transactions going on nine parallel we think it's sort of a whole thing 
00:24:11	00:24:23	2	and and and and so you know i'm not explaining it very well but but she covers it from different angles like that and then goes through and describe you know different uh physics concept you what was the other one there was um 
00:24:23	00:24:35	1	[noise] for a lick systems uh which i think or things like um [noise] they're kind of halfway between um uh <unk> i guess it's kind of a control 
00:24:35	00:24:46	2	it's like world pools in a stream where the the system of the world pool has maintained even though the components of the world <unk> are you the water 
00:24:46	00:24:48	1	um it's constantly changing 
00:24:57	00:24:59	1	like a lot different parts 
00:24:59	00:25:05	2	and she has interesting comments in that direction as well um she um she blames every 
00:25:05	00:25:07	1	all the evils of the world on uh 
00:25:07	00:25:24	2	<unk> new telling me and i'm forty and you know mindset uh-huh mm that uh well maybe they were useful but they're leading to two generations of our society and we need to have a new quentin view tests so she's a bit of a profit as well 
00:25:24	00:25:25	1	uh-huh well 
00:25:25	00:25:30	2	there seemed to be a reasonable number of people um on that bandwagon 
00:25:30	00:25:37	1	yeah well well i i tend to agree with that in in in non specific senses 
00:25:43	00:25:45	1	i get the impression that 
00:25:45	00:26:02	2	nothing that she really said that the original because when i was i said when i spoke to this one guy he said oh well he started people claim that things before but her seemed to have all the bits together in one place and it seemed to be reasonably regrets i'm it and you know it made sense that it was it was a good read it was good fun 
00:26:02	00:26:04	1	well that's 
00:26:04	00:26:06	2	a reasonable thing man 
00:26:06	00:26:06	1	indeed 
00:26:06	00:26:10	2	[noise] that's what i just finished reading was dracula 
00:26:10	00:26:11	1	[laughter] 
00:26:18	00:26:21	1	yeah it was not a good huh 
00:26:21	00:26:30	2	i mean good or was it just so different than than what they they write these days that it was unrecognizable i was pretty good and actually what 
00:26:30	00:26:32	1	oh oh <unk> i thought was 
00:26:32	00:26:41	2	interesting in the beginning and it actually continue throughout and was reasonably consistent with that i i didn't know this have you ever read it 
00:26:41	00:26:43	1	no no 
00:26:48	00:26:50	1	oh really oh 
00:26:50	00:26:55	2	so there you know several characters in the book keeping journals 
00:26:55	00:26:58	1	explaining what they did that day 
00:26:58	00:27:05	2	oh <unk> and then he said he interspersed so it does like june fifth unlimited joe's diary and seasons diary and frank's diary 
00:27:05	00:27:10	1	yeah oh wow and so yeah you you follow 
00:27:10	00:27:18	2	so long and um you get different viewpoints on a few of the things and something that he did that i think 
00:27:18	00:27:21	1	probably pretty original and the time that 
00:27:21	00:27:29	2	<unk> was writing [noise] was that all of the dialogue of all of the characters is very colloquial 
00:27:30	00:27:31	2	and um 
00:27:38	00:27:40	1	dock workers in london 
00:27:49	00:27:50	1	okay exactly yeah 
00:27:50	00:28:05	2	when you uh read then health sings stuff it's quite clear that english is not his first language he's very educated but he used he misuses grammar 
00:28:05	00:28:07	1	oh right and and and 
00:28:07	00:28:10	2	system throughout the entire book he does 
00:28:10	00:28:11	1	which is yeah 
00:28:11	00:28:12	2	interesting 
00:28:12	00:28:13	1	right yeah 
00:28:13	00:28:20	2	so it was interesting in that way and um it was [noise] uh 
00:28:20	00:28:24	1	for my liking a little moralistic and heavy on the cruise 
00:28:24	00:28:33	2	and uh motifs but uh it was uh pretty good true uh 
00:28:33	00:28:37	1	telling of the vampire myth <unk> i mean since 
00:28:37	00:28:45	2	much of the modern stuff is based directly on it yeah you would hope that it was [laughter] pretty much that but but it was 
00:28:45	00:28:49	1	it was interesting i've actually been reading a lot 
00:28:49	00:28:57	2	stuff along those lines recently because i i started playing in a uh live action role playing game once a month 
00:28:57	00:28:58	1	oh uh 
00:28:58	00:29:01	2	uh it's called vampire the masquerade 
00:29:02	00:29:04	2	and huh 
00:29:16	00:29:17	1	basically 
00:29:17	00:29:37	2	mind world in which vampires and wear wolves and rave and mummies and such walk the world yeah and our real but like the <unk> uh the masquerade is <unk> lead to find set of rules that vampires for the most part live on 
00:29:37	00:29:38	1	and 
00:29:38	00:29:45	2	for the masquerade is because they want humans to believe they don't exist 
00:29:45	00:29:47	1	exactly yeah 
00:29:47	00:29:58	2	there are these minor problems that uh well you you find out when you read the histories in er the game that for instance the inquisition was actually completely 
00:29:58	00:29:59	1	about vampire
