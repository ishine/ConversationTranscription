00:07:03	00:07:04	2	you don't have to 
00:07:04	00:07:07	1	the chance to it's just i don't know having a hard time 
00:07:07	00:07:09	2	you know if you want to wait till later on 
00:07:09	00:07:17	1	like since you know me so all you could figure all that out but like i just wanted to go away ready so it was like talking about is just you know what i mean 
00:07:20	00:07:24	2	mhm [noise] oh like one more myself stuffed in you know 
00:07:24	00:07:26	1	uh-huh right so 
00:07:26	00:07:31	2	i don't know being stupid being like self destructive and [noise] 
00:07:31	00:07:33	1	it's like that well i just learned a little less 
00:07:33	00:07:48	2	yeah got hot right now i'm just kidding [laughter] um i i was when i got home yesterday for the concert i had a really nice time with my <unk> like half of the group is really strange and the other half like i like and even ashamed what they're funny you know what i mean 
00:07:48	00:07:49	1	okay and 
00:07:49	00:08:01	2	i got back and it was really connect not excited to come back 'cause like i came home and i just like <unk> looked around my entry on my floor and i was just like i don't like the people are not friends with them and i have no friends here you know <unk> 
00:08:01	00:08:06	1	that's one of the things that i wanted to to address um but i don't remember what i had to talk about it anyway but i had 
00:08:06	00:08:16	2	and i just got like you know all depressed and like i sat in front of my psych looks like three hours and i like i couldn't read it because obviously it was like thinking you know and like 
00:08:16	00:08:24	1	whatever david has a theory and i think it makes a lot of fun i really mad at him by the way because the other <unk> yeah i mean he didn't call it where it pays 
00:08:24	00:08:39	2	okay i'll tell him and and um he and he's like he's like always but you haven't ever like you know you've been completely will but you've never been so so so sat right i'm like this because i don't do the extreme you know so so so happy so so so sad you know 
00:08:39	00:08:42	1	and he's like so it's like a borderline extreme 
00:08:44	00:08:46	1	oh this is like to see me 
00:08:46	00:08:47	2	what 
00:08:47	00:08:49	1	yeah yeah so 
00:09:02	00:09:03	1	and that's why like you're still 
00:09:03	00:09:12	2	fine i think it makes it kind of like it makes sense i know cause as much as they need people around here like emotionally like i'm like i'm a <unk> like you know 
00:09:12	00:09:17	1	that's like it's almost like i feel like whenever i do cry like i feel like that's weird like 
00:09:17	00:09:24	2	i feel like a wheel where'd paula because because of that you know because deep down like i have that but still like it feels like there's 
00:09:24	00:09:29	1	you know mhm mhm so then i was like i like whatever i just thought about i think that uh 
00:09:29	00:09:41	2	a lot you know what can i do and all this stuff and like maybe i really can't relate to non jews maybe that's what it is maybe it's just that i'm i'm lucky with the people that are around me i don't like they're not awful i just don't click within maybe it's because i'm a year older but i doubt that you know 
00:09:41	00:09:44	1	it's like oh it's acting too much so quickly 
00:09:44	00:09:50	2	it's not so quickly anymore you know and and it's it's come to the extent like whenever anyone talks about 
00:09:50	00:10:00	1	they're they're having friends like i don't understand you know or get jealous or like like it's not an a casual thing when someone else says yeah i went out with my friends last night 
00:10:00	00:10:05	2	like no same with me [laughter] totally me like there's like this little like 
00:10:05	00:10:13	1	we're not worried like comes up this little like cringe or something you know like <unk> um <unk> you know what about my cat 
00:10:13	00:10:17	2	oh well yeah but i don't like they're okay 
00:10:17	00:10:21	1	hang out with him other than my <unk> i kind of little i can <unk> 
00:10:21	00:10:31	2	well after tour we will well i don't know like the normal people like i really like china of course you know but whatever she's good i know she's going to 
00:10:38	00:10:45	1	you know going to have been a sorority you know but like i like you know what i mean right anyway 
00:10:50	00:11:00	1	because i was trying to convince me to join the east side of the girls who are already like <unk> <unk> he <unk> he was in a pie but um 
00:11:00	00:11:03	2	this guy um you should join 
00:11:03	00:11:08	1	[laughter] i used to <unk> have you what i was the extent like on friday nights 
00:11:08	00:11:16	2	says that people like make lots of friends that are that i i i don't want to do it i can't like just the principle of <unk> i could not be the authority 
00:11:16	00:11:18	1	so that's like there was just remember that i was like 
00:11:18	00:11:27	2	going to be what's it called rushing it i was like we're that come from it's like i don't know it was like what was the reaction when they told you that he's like a reason i was like uh 
00:11:27	00:11:30	1	[laughter] anyway point is um 
00:11:30	00:11:34	2	<unk> all these feeling like nathan there yeah 
00:11:34	00:11:36	1	i love it and like 
00:11:36	00:11:42	2	but it's really good like we like we were talking like we get we ate lunch at her last week and that really i can't really 
00:11:42	00:11:45	1	<unk> famous you so much 
00:11:45	00:11:46	2	don't feel bad 
00:11:46	00:11:50	1	i'll let you talk and say okay let me finish though 
00:11:50	00:12:06	2	i mean i was like and i hate that i had to worry about all these things again like you know <unk> c._d. my college would go to the hills you would go and this and that would ever look at when i go to the hill and find like i don't care like you know i know everyone and like it's fine but um anyway

00:12:24	00:12:36	2	those things and i wasn't what do you just miss those thing no no so my point is and then i wasn't depressed as much anymore and like if it was it worth it to be certain friends last night you know what i mean 
00:12:36	00:12:44	1	that happens to me when things like switch really quickly or something you know but then it'll come right that like <unk> on my back so quickly 
00:12:44	00:12:57	2	january she said to me i mean whatever i don't really talk to them any more but like he's like that's corny as it sounds it it's a good thing to be my idea of like it's just not worth it to get depressed over things it's just not worth it you know what i mean 
00:13:09	00:13:12	1	can't live on that somebody that i'll go
