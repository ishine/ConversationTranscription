00:00:08	00:00:19	2	[noise] so i just uh visited with alice oh did ya yeah yeah i finally got over there okay so uh we had a good chat oh very good yeah so um how 
00:00:19	00:00:23	1	it was your visit with uh joan o'neill yesterday when i hear there was a mix 
00:00:23	00:00:31	2	um really it was nothing we didn't even have a visit yeah because they were too many people uh when we came over from the uh chapel 
00:00:31	00:00:34	1	it was that carol forest yeah 
00:00:34	00:00:47	2	and had when i we're supposed to be at her table because she has set on her invitation we try to special indication from her yeah the same state as my table well we've got over by the table and the for these two men who obviously we're from florida 
00:00:47	00:00:48	1	mhm 
00:00:48	00:00:50	2	because they look very dark skinned [laughter] oh 
00:00:50	00:00:52	1	[laughter] 
00:01:14	00:01:24	2	uh-huh she probably did uh well anyhow she wasn't even into dying from yet and along came or family home we know pretty well you're from <unk> they're all about twenty years older but we 
00:01:24	00:01:28	1	seen them off and on and they must have been at least twenty of them 
00:01:36	00:01:36	1	mhm 
00:01:36	00:01:41	2	because they're at least twenty people standing here but he's two and then it would seem down already parked it 
00:01:41	00:01:43	1	oh god 
00:01:43	00:02:00	2	so um rosemary and he said you know she'll be seen sisters should use we haven't seen it all all summer so why don't you pretty fit with her and i will find that at the table [noise] where we said no this is not rights and i used to stay on her so much she came and she felt terrible because there were so many people enough seats 
00:02:01	00:02:06	2	but i think the problem is i was saying oh dallas and i was saying earlier 
00:02:06	00:02:07	1	they didn't send 
00:02:07	00:02:09	2	<unk> most likely 
00:02:09	00:02:10	1	they might not uh 
00:02:10	00:02:21	2	that type of books that had she machinery asked for two tables yeah and she could have used for easily oh my goodness yeah i think that was the only person either i think there were several who would who needed more seats 
00:02:21	00:02:22	1	yeah 
00:02:22	00:02:29	2	so that was embarrassing in the end so we never even saw a movie theater and then at the end i try to look for it but i couldn't even find 
00:02:29	00:02:31	1	so that was the end of the business 
00:02:31	00:02:38	2	yes because i ended up um at the very end i mean i i i said well i don't care if i eat i 
00:02:38	00:02:41	1	carol you know and um it 
00:02:41	00:02:47	2	uh you know really up to visit so they did find a couple of seats in the end and it was with carol 
00:02:47	00:02:50	1	and now we're way away 
00:02:50	00:03:05	2	<unk> in the corner and yet in and out section right and uh at that point there had already been people sitting there and then um they went to the place where they were supposed to be into their chair and then we had uh it was it was a real mixed it's at least 
00:03:05	00:03:10	1	oh in the end i ended up which was nice i said anyway oh did you know fortieth anniversary 
00:03:10	00:03:12	2	oh okay 
00:03:12	00:03:13	1	<unk> you tend to have one 
00:03:13	00:03:15	2	oh my gosh 
00:03:15	00:03:18	1	<unk> kept getting madder and madder 
00:03:25	00:03:27	2	so it was nice in the end 
00:03:27	00:03:35	1	well allison's funny she said you know in the end they didn't even get coffee i said well we didn't either but we didn't even have a cup to get the coffee [laughter] 
00:03:35	00:03:51	2	[laughter] anyway at all no i didn't know what kind of very messy yeah yeah it was a shame it was they had a whole lot more than expected oh yeah mhm and that's not really fair you know yeah well that he had a better way to work at <unk> 
00:03:51	00:03:53	1	yeah i don't know what their house 
00:03:53	00:04:08	2	censorship yeah yeah <unk> uh i was saying dallas you know you know in the end they're going to be a few extra people but then also a few people drop out at the very frightening it usually evens out but ah yesterday sure didn't 
00:04:09	00:04:23	2	yeah the land sell it and it was it was sitting on her 'cause she's my chest and she went back into the kitchen at one point because she kind of fell through a responsible being at the college yeah and she talked to this lovely young woman who seems <unk> 
00:04:23	00:04:27	1	yeah i met her yeah and she said to her well if you don't have enough so we just keep those hotdog 
00:04:30	00:04:36	1	[noise] but i came back at the end and said no thank you said there were um forty extra meals they have to 
00:04:36	00:04:37	2	uh-huh 
00:04:37	00:04:38	1	gosh and that's a lot of food 
00:04:38	00:04:42	2	it certainly is because they're usually ready for five or ten extra <unk> 
00:04:42	00:04:49	1	like not <unk> no <unk> instead of giving them like three or four pieces that <unk> 
00:04:49	00:05:05	2	i know i know and when we got the little dessert you know i'll be carol next to me and she said oh he's portions are terrible i said carol they're probably doing it because they're making it you know shorter ran into right oh that's right that's right all right then all right then 
00:05:05	00:05:11	1	and there wasn't much for them actually was a very small legal but not as good at the end you don't like big heavy meal 
00:05:11	00:05:13	2	yeah but then <unk> 
00:05:13	00:05:15	1	oh <unk> oh yeah 
00:05:15	00:05:18	2	i like the way it <unk> it was very simple
