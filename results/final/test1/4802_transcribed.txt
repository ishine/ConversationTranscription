00:09:38	00:09:40	1	yeah 
00:09:40	00:09:48	2	i just you know it's hard enough for me <unk> i'm the looking when i'm here with them but i don't know i do the day

00:10:18	00:10:19	1	swatch 
00:10:19	00:10:32	2	right and stuff doesn't it i don't know i don't know how to go but i'm gonna have to correct mhm most don't know how to do these things that must be something yeah 'cause he really wants right 
00:10:32	00:10:39	1	[noise] not i mean the thing is it because he doesn't [noise] you know like <unk> now taking correspondence course 'cause you should have dropped 
00:10:39	00:10:50	2	his high school education in the middle 'cause they didn't have enough voice are interested in not enough money whatever so he had hopefully going to finish your degree with corresponds but he knows english knows how to write and read and and you know 
00:11:01	00:11:02	1	mhm 
00:11:02	00:11:11	2	because he only had the summer you know yeah but he'll pick it up is good in that mhm so i don't know how you go about correspondence you do everything on your own 
00:11:34	00:11:37	1	mhm did you do like that 
00:11:37	00:11:45	2	[noise] is that it doesn't need so much typing a lot of it is yes and no answers now there are some essay questions but the question is if you know 
00:11:45	00:11:50	1	[noise] if he really has no english back when i think it will be very difficult for him to do it 
00:11:50	00:11:59	2	like the geography and the history and literature and um psychology there was some you know different 
00:11:59	00:12:04	1	isn't it i mean <unk> <unk> doesn't need the you know he had two years of credits 
00:12:04	00:12:10	2	teachers had to finish off two more years well i mean he has like four years to do with with 
00:12:10	00:12:12	1	you talking about high school
