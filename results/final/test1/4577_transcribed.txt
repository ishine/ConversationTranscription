00:03:48	00:03:53	2	some classic rock uh-huh you know alternative is like the new stuff but the kids these days are listening 
00:03:53	00:03:56	1	stuff that their parents were pretty much right so it's 
00:03:56	00:04:05	2	more of a college town alternative like you know that band or vodka uh-huh they started out as alternative but everyone ended up liking him so i guess they're no longer alternative
