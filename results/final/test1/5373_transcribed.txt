00:00:00	00:00:04	2	hello 
00:00:04	00:00:05	1	it's okay to be recorded 
00:00:05	00:00:13	2	absolutely how um how you're feeling oh you know at the end of pregnancy it's [laughter] 
00:00:13	00:00:16	1	can't wait till it's old done and over again 
00:00:16	00:00:19	2	late where you you do the same day as me right 
00:00:19	00:00:24	1	yes it was almost two week oh god that is like the most horrible thought to me it was 
00:00:36	00:00:41	1	um i belong to this computer last right mhm of women who were uh 
00:00:44	00:00:45	1	oh yeah 
00:00:45	00:00:51	2	and um one of the ladies on the list was do two weeks ago oh wow and 
00:00:51	00:00:57	1	doesn't want to be induced i really don't understand that at all so she keeps cancelling her indication 
00:00:57	00:01:07	2	that's interesting yeah see the the only problem is she doesn't understand i mean granted it's fine to go natural and to make sure you know the when the baby's right the baby's ready but the baby also grows 
00:01:07	00:01:13	1	[laughter] no really difficult to get 'em out also you you you <unk> starts to break down hill 
00:01:13	00:01:20	2	i know when you you and you start to have less family out at fluid 'cause the baby's bigger yeah i think it's totally a bad idea but well 
00:01:20	00:01:29	1	uh i think it's a fun idea only if there was a difference between if she was absolutely sure about her dates and the doctor <unk> was 
00:01:29	00:01:30	2	his <unk> yeah 
00:01:30	00:01:37	1	because um i just had this um this patient and today um she uh the wife insisted that 
00:01:37	00:01:41	2	they'd be should be do on the fourteenth according to her calculations and the doctor was like 
00:01:41	00:01:42	1	[noise] no 
00:01:42	00:01:55	2	you're wrong you know the baby's due on the seventh or something like that she said no no and and the way she <unk> she was very good about taking your temperature and knowing exactly i think the <unk> 
00:01:55	00:01:57	1	[laughter] and um 
00:01:57	00:02:02	2	so sure enough the baby was born in the thirteenth since she was she was accurate 
00:02:02	00:02:09	1	i met someone last night and one doctor she has two different doctors and they have a two weeks difference between them 
00:02:09	00:02:13	2	oh so yeah that can be a big difference 
00:02:13	00:02:19	1	big yeah you know it's funny now how much do you find you talking to women about babies in pregnancy 
00:02:19	00:02:25	2	[laughter] see i'm talking to them a lot but i'm still not really interested in <unk>

00:06:25	00:06:27	1	[laughter] 
00:06:27	00:06:31	2	i started looking i was thinking about california style home [laughter]

00:06:37	00:06:45	2	yeah it was modern it was sort of silly because it was almost right next door to that crappy house that that pet lived in [noise] yeah and i think it was right next to them

00:06:50	00:06:55	2	yeah she probably took him for half of it now so [laughter] so [laughter] who knows who at at at one 
00:06:55	00:07:00	1	to that had a really nice house the um the one whose husband died 
00:07:00	00:07:05	2	and then she moved to los angeles and they never heard hiding her hair ever again um

00:07:36	00:07:37	1	yeah yeah 
00:07:37	00:07:49	2	strange though to block but then again in that area you sort of they don't people don't really care about big house next to small how sort of thing it's like you take the view as you get it and that's it [laughter] they build it higher and higher 
00:07:50	00:07:56	2	[noise] oh say feeling feeling energetic or tired

00:08:39	00:08:40	1	[laughter] 
00:08:40	00:08:52	2	<unk> i'm going to find someone could [laughter] well we um when i when i had tyson we had something called share care because well you said that you don't have some private it's all public 
00:08:52	00:08:53	1	yeah there is no such thing as 
00:08:53	00:09:00	2	yeah so i had i paid for a private doctor and um if i had private health insurance i could have had um 
00:09:00	00:09:03	1	[noise] i paid for him and um 
00:09:03	00:09:11	2	he would just do most of my check ups towards the end like you did it at twenty weeks and then like a twenty eight weeks and then um as of about 
00:09:11	00:09:14	1	i think the last month i had to see 
00:09:18	00:09:37	2	and it's a good thing he came to <unk> doesn't he doesn't come here anymore now the only off situation that we have private up situation that we have in town is only in <unk> and he's which is a half hour away and you basically just sit in the office and you come in and they just take your blood pressure and they talk she how you going into my <unk> around the baby a little bit and there's no internal exam of course and then that's it 
00:09:37	00:09:40	1	i mean i could go to my doctor and do the same some a little bit 
00:09:40	00:09:42	2	as to how to go next time 
00:09:44	00:09:52	2	oh yeah i would be so much different if i had a baby again i mean well we do plan actually on having more than one but yeah 
00:09:52	00:09:56	1	you know i just i mean i just thought it would be so different i mean i i find 
00:09:56	00:10:00	2	but i don't need to see the doctor i have no desire to see the dog

00:10:29	00:10:34	1	does he make sure that the baby's head down takes my blood pressure

00:19:43	00:20:04	2	<unk> and also community service like even by like grade nine they have to participate in some sort of community service whether it be through a military or um in hospital or something they have to you know they have to be active in the community too so the requirements are really high and and um the education is fairly expensive but but we feel that that's gonna be 
00:20:04	00:20:10	1	the best thing for him <unk> but 'cause otherwise we we're not churchgoers we don't do anything with the church so yeah 
00:20:10	00:20:18	2	[noise] i don't know what we're going to do that you know the schools here it's really weird they don't have non religious schools here oh really 
00:20:18	00:20:21	1	public schools are religious schools 
00:20:21	00:20:22	2	oh wow 
00:20:22	00:20:24	1	totally <unk> 
00:20:24	00:20:31	2	right now it's mainly catholic isn't it yeah so yeah so we're kind of go to catholic school there's just no question about that 
00:20:31	00:20:33	1	because there's not a jewish school 
00:20:33	00:20:41	2	well there there are jewish schools but we're not um but we thought we would do is that the kid would go to a catholic school and 
00:20:41	00:20:44	1	you know in <unk> and then i didn't roll them in like 
00:20:56	00:20:57	1	<unk> 
00:20:57	00:21:01	2	to uh [noise] you know do it on his own room and you're not 
00:21:01	00:21:03	1	for <unk> right 
00:21:03	00:21:14	2	[noise] definitely takes family guns 'cause especially it was a bit of a an awakening especially when i <unk> requested information from the school i got this whole package on the goals of the school with the children's education 
00:21:14	00:21:18	1	and um [noise] there um 
00:21:18	00:21:30	2	what do you call their their mission statement and all you know this that and this and what's expected of a child and what's expected the parents and it was like whoa wow you know we're gonna have to participate 
00:21:30	00:21:35	1	[laughter] but that was good too because i realized you know um maybe we need something like that 
00:21:35	00:21:39	2	[noise] yeah i have a friend and you know she goes to church all the time and stuff 
00:21:39	00:21:40	1	and uh 
00:21:40	00:21:54	2	she's not like um and and she tells me some of the stuff that like the churches done for her and i mean i'm really not into the religious aspect of it at all like you know i'm really not into the whole you know jesus christ will obviously because i'm jewish 
00:21:54	00:21:55	1	yeah but like 
00:21:55	00:21:57	2	whole community 
00:21:57	00:22:01	1	the part of her meanness you know part of this community is like totally great 
00:22:01	00:22:10	2	that's yeah that that is a nice part of it actually and also um [noise] well you're fortunate their things private ah well i guess they're all christian 
00:22:10	00:22:12	1	christian schools 
00:22:25	00:22:29	1	that have sent their children going from the public system onto this um the 
00:22:29	00:22:40	2	looking college whether they'd be from a religious family or not so the children have just become so altruistic you know they have genuine concern for their other classmates and 
00:22:40	00:22:41	1	and um they'll 
00:22:41	00:22:54	2	think it's great because now now um their their education is not disruptive you know there's not other children creating problem none of the tests and everybody is very respectful of each other and that's really nice 
00:22:54	00:22:55	1	yeah i mean i have i have 
00:22:55	00:22:57	2	ah see here in the office that 
00:22:57	00:23:07	1	[noise] you know the the reason why they ran is because they're hurting themselves because kids are doing mean things to them in school they're pulling chairs out from under them knocking them over pushing them over 
00:23:07	00:23:10	2	yeah it's it's horrible it's just really horrible 
00:23:10	00:23:14	1	just rough has <unk> rough housing so 
00:23:14	00:23:15	2	[laughter] 
00:23:15	00:23:21	1	but you know it's it's funny when you start thinking about these things those then you start taking those really responsible role and 
00:23:29	00:23:35	2	ah no um actually cousins on anything in particular so we don't but i'd be <unk> being like 
00:23:35	00:23:37	1	oh no no problem at all 
00:23:37	00:23:39	2	did you have to talk to the uh priest first 
00:23:39	00:23:49	1	yeah we had to go for an interview 'cause we had it done you know we had it done it see i don't remember yeah and uh no there was absolutely no problem nothing mhm and and 
00:24:04	00:24:04	1	[noise] 
00:24:04	00:24:10	2	um you know how do you want to raise your child i think they asked me that they might not have you've asked 
00:24:10	00:24:14	1	no they were just they would all they took for granted was that oh he's going to 
00:24:14	00:24:17	2	<unk> and the catholic church so they obviously gave us 
00:24:17	00:24:21	1	oh responsibilities from the catholic point of view yeah 
00:24:21	00:24:27	2	yeah 'cause we don't know what we're gonna do about that yeah we haven't decided [noise] because um 
00:24:27	00:24:29	1	like from what i understood having a bath 
00:24:29	00:24:35	2	to them is like a promise to the church that you're going to raise the child is a catholic income that jesus christ is 
00:24:45	00:24:47	1	yeah 
00:24:47	00:24:59	2	i remember that now yes that was an issue and then the issue was is that the the uh unfortunately we did the baptism for <unk> for rich 
00:24:59	00:25:00	1	cool uh-huh 
00:25:00	00:25:07	2	you know it was basically for family okay and a ritual and also almost like tyson's coming out partying 
00:25:07	00:25:09	1	yeah yeah 
00:25:09	00:25:17	2	um a true symbolism for us because we accepted that that tyson would be baptized 
00:25:17	00:25:19	1	and um and he would 
00:25:19	00:25:32	2	eventually have a christian education but there was no promise to the catholic church in our book [laughter] we cross your fingers jury met her heart huh [laughter] 
00:25:33	00:25:46	2	but it but it was definitely an issue because we had to think well why are we doing this how we'd being true to ourselves why are we doing it but we didn't use it for several reasons you know it was important for my parents or your dad very it was 
00:25:46	00:25:47	1	my in laws too 
00:25:47	00:25:57	2	yes and and we're comfortable with that you know it was fine we were very comfortable with that and it only men to us it was going to have a christian education that was it 
00:25:57	00:25:58	1	okay 
00:26:02	00:26:05	1	stuff like i caught up or rabbi 
00:26:05	00:26:22	2	and i'm like you know well what happens if we have like a jewish naming ceremony i'm like you know i'm like what does that mean to have a jewish naming ceremony you know because i was trying i was trying to figure out like i know what it means to have a baptism right i mean it's a promise so i was trying to get her out what does it mean to have a jewish naming ceremony 
00:26:22	00:26:22	1	right 
00:26:22	00:26:24	2	[noise] what's your what 
00:26:24	00:26:27	1	and him and the rabbits like well you know if you're jewish or babies jewish 
00:26:27	00:26:28	2	mhm 
00:26:28	00:26:34	1	yes i'm like hello i'm like yeah well i understand that that's the way that you know that's what the jews 
00:26:34	00:26:39	2	leave i might but what does that mean that that's the way through my l._a. yeah 
00:26:39	00:26:49	1	i mean in my making a promise to you know the jewish religion that i'm you know that this child's going to be a jew i said 'cause i can't make that promised because you know they'll probably go to catholic school too 
00:26:49	00:26:58	2	[noise] and the guy's like well if you're jewish the babies [laughter] but he had a real jewish acts 
00:26:58	00:26:59	1	no so 
00:26:59	00:27:08	2	[laughter] he was a real forceful rabbi oh well if you're jewish babies jewish you know there's no question 
00:27:08	00:27:12	1	i know it was pretty funny well you know <unk> things 
00:27:12	00:27:27	2	change over a period of time to you know like you know certainly in the nineties you have people that they they mixed things they mix and match [laughter] as far as their religion is concerned how you're gonna raise a child [noise] so if you if you're not so keen on well let's talk about this and let's figure out 
00:27:27	00:27:28	1	you know 
00:27:28	00:27:42	2	what does it mean if if he's going through this naming ceremony and all he sticks to his his dogma and you're not supportive of that well then you still want to do your own thing anyway well you know should i should i go through both ceremonies or 
00:27:42	00:27:44	1	well you know what i i feel 
00:27:44	00:27:53	2	say it which is a lot of the stuff is actually crap anyway because technically child should decide later on for themselves if they want to be baptized 
00:27:53	00:28:03	1	yeah yeah that's the way the um the mennonite to do it all of a friend that it's the men and they don't believe in baptized and the baby they baptize as an adult 
00:28:03	00:28:06	2	i think that that's probably more reasonable 
00:28:06	00:28:18	1	you know it's the child is i mean it's it's the person's decision rabbit and the parents now the catholics get into the bit of the guilt trip 'cause the first thing the reason why you have to have your child baptized is not just for the promise of education but is that if the child 
00:28:18	00:28:20	2	died she i know 
00:28:20	00:28:21	1	the child will go to heaven 
00:28:21	00:28:25	2	[laughter] that's really true 
00:28:25	00:28:29	1	well that's exactly that's another reason for even for going for the old baptist 
00:28:29	00:28:33	2	[laughter] 
00:28:33	00:28:36	1	well they're going to be they going to be monitoring this folks 
00:28:36	00:28:43	2	[laughter] 
00:28:43	00:28:45	1	the philosophers 
00:28:45	00:28:58	2	[laughter] did ask him degree in science you should ask them for the tape [laughter] we let her remembered is [laughter] 
00:28:58	00:29:01	1	oh did you hear so many i mean my mother in law gave it a little 
00:29:07	00:29:08	1	but 
00:29:08	00:29:12	2	<unk> it's a friend of ours you know and he's going why you really have 
00:29:12	00:29:19	1	pick one religion because you know you can't raise the kid in both religions because they're just going to get two confused and they're going to have an identity 
00:29:26	00:29:30	1	[laughter] wait till you had the baby i mean 
00:29:30	00:29:44	2	you know religion is a bit of an important issue but wait they have the baby it all the different ways that you're going to be told about everything now nursing mothers will say the baby that all the baby needs <unk> that's it only breast milk you mother in law is going to say 
00:29:44	00:29:45	1	get the baby bottle 
00:29:45	00:29:58	2	give it the baby some water <unk> my mother in law was on the baby's need water babies any more and my mother in law was dead set against breastfeeding she didn't think it was natural [laughter] 
00:29:58	00:30:00	1	thank you it's natural
