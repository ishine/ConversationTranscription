00:09:36	00:09:39	1	[noise] uh from the uh 
00:09:39	00:09:49	2	<unk> you said you know when they found different layers of sentiment there <unk> record from one way or 
00:09:49	00:09:53	1	when it was always completely different 
00:09:53	00:09:56	2	like there wasn't any graduate changes 
00:09:56	00:09:58	1	mhm 
00:09:58	00:10:11	2	from you know like there'll be one type of clam on one level and then the next level it's like um it's the same you know the they're the same species but some of the <unk> 
00:10:11	00:10:14	1	or like so drastic and like 
00:10:14	00:10:18	2	this world will be going clock wise on one level and then on the next level 
00:10:30	00:10:31	1	where there's like 
00:10:31	00:10:44	2	the clams going clock wise and planes going ten o'clock wise are together at the same time mm and all over whenever [laughter] excuse me whenever they look at <unk> settlements 
00:10:48	00:10:50	1	and so it's kinda like 
00:10:50	00:10:51	2	what does that mean 
00:10:51	00:10:57	1	well yeah they're <unk> they're proposing this theory it was

00:11:23	00:11:25	1	what was it called 
00:11:32	00:11:40	2	massive genetic u. t. shirts happening happening at once 
00:11:40	00:11:43	1	and um 
00:11:43	00:11:53	2	you mean like if you if they say that if you look at uh species that <unk> like they're hot spots on the genes where they meet <unk> mhm 
00:11:53	00:11:56	1	like things don't happen overnight 
00:11:56	00:12:02	2	uh i mean things don't happen they happen in specific spaces 
00:12:02	00:12:05	1	okay jeans okay uh 
00:12:05	00:12:11	2	it's not completely random mediation isn't there's it seems to be some sort of pattern to it 
00:12:21	00:12:23	1	make the changes 
00:12:23	00:12:34	2	but it's what um you know like there'll be mutations and most of them don't work out you know like mhm um either 
00:12:34	00:12:36	1	but yeah um 
00:12:36	00:12:47	2	[noise] species never like make the past fertilization or whatever you know but every once in a while one comes along and it does work mhm

00:20:49	00:21:04	2	excellent though it's so incredibly beautiful just absolutely beautiful like unspoiled the beautiful you know and uh just being under water was just so amazing oh my god there it was just like 
00:21:04	00:21:06	1	it was so quiet and you're just 
00:21:06	00:21:11	2	completely unfolded and water so it's kind of like the slow dream like thing
