00:18:16	00:18:26	2	you know mom i want to have my friends over [laughter] right and i want to do this it's just really it's different yeah well she she's at this cute age now too 
00:18:26	00:18:35	1	oh yeah she's real cute age i can imagine finding another one younger um purchasing on friday i babysat for a 
00:18:35	00:18:44	2	they were one you know rachel and then one years old and two years old oh my gosh oh but the one year old and two year old get along real well 
00:18:44	00:18:48	1	it wasn't too bad yeah good but 
00:18:48	00:18:56	2	yeah i'm gonna start looking into doing something after the first year i need to get some money coming in here for myself mhm i'm going crazy 
00:18:56	00:18:59	1	yeah that's what helps with the babysitting too 
00:19:11	00:19:12	1	oh yeah yeah 
00:19:12	00:19:16	2	i used to sing where they're over it um one of the churches i was at but anyway 
00:19:16	00:19:19	1	so i called their and anyway the principal 
00:19:19	00:19:28	2	back and he said they haven't opening after the first year one day a week in the afternoon and i said well i have kids in my own would that'd be a problem you know that's not a problem 
00:19:28	00:19:31	1	after school care yeah 
00:19:37	00:19:38	1	yeah 
00:19:46	00:19:51	2	but and then i thought you know i said the time this was a school i was thinking about for jacob to go 
00:19:51	00:19:56	1	yeah so it's a private school it's a private christian school well 
00:19:56	00:20:08	2	i don't know if i want him going there or not it's a very fundamental school which is fine that i don't have a problem with but one of the philosophies or whatever it is about punished 
00:20:08	00:20:09	1	uh-huh 
00:20:09	00:20:21	2	they have a statement and they're saying that that we agree that it's okay for them for corporal punishment as long as there's one other adult you know 
00:20:21	00:20:23	1	i don't i don't believe in that but 
00:20:23	00:20:31	2	tom and i'm a teacher no excuse us will leave the spanking [laughter] but the thing and what the what you need to 
00:20:31	00:20:34	1	wait then is you know you know your child 
00:20:34	00:20:41	2	i mean like i don't believe that my children would ever do anything that would require them to be round car all there may be a time 
00:20:41	00:20:44	1	right but you never know 
00:20:44	00:20:53	2	you know and and i just um i don't know about the same time i do like discipline but i don't think they need you know you're oh god 
00:20:53	00:21:00	1	yeah you're right i have a hard time i would have a hard time with that but if you were there after school you kind of get an eye 
00:21:00	00:21:08	2	yeah so i thought you know let me see there and see ones what it's like you know doesn't he's not going to be going to school for a few more years anyway but yeah 
00:21:08	00:21:12	1	you know it's a way to get your foot in the door maybe their philosophy will change or something 
00:21:12	00:21:23	2	did i tell you that our school system because they change the buses that used to be <unk> um first grade through eighth grade i went on the same bus and now they split it up now it's first in fourth and fourth and fifth through eight 
00:21:23	00:21:24	1	oh that makes sense 
00:21:24	00:21:32	2	so now the little kids start an hour later so they have free before school care you can drop your child off at seven o'clock in the morning 
00:21:32	00:21:36	1	cost a dollar for them to have cereal and milk orange juice and a meeting 
00:21:36	00:21:38	2	oh that's great 
00:21:54	00:21:59	1	have to pay for it right but that's a bargain [laughter] 
00:21:59	00:22:15	2	oh how many towns do i mean it's just and i'm surprised because not a ton of people use it mhm so just surprises me yeah but yeah <unk> that is a problem i think with a private school you really have to look at their philosophy 
00:22:15	00:22:19	1	yeah and see there's only like one teacher per grade so i mean it's a small school 
00:22:19	00:22:20	2	yeah 
00:22:20	00:22:21	1	[laughter] 
00:22:21	00:22:27	2	you know i figure if i go there and help out after school at least i can get a sense of the kids 
00:22:27	00:22:30	1	the teenagers and yeah you know i i would go i would take up 
00:22:30	00:22:35	2	you know so i have the application here and they got to do a criminal <unk> fine i don't care 
00:22:46	00:22:51	2	yeah see i he would go to a public school around here but well 
00:22:51	00:22:53	1	well let me tell you they but they do 
00:22:56	00:23:00	1	book alexander's a horrible smell good very bad day well anyway there's a book 
00:23:06	00:23:12	2	i'm serious age at school and i said yeah he went through the whole neighborhood you know all the way up to eighth grade i'm thinking yeah like you're gonna want me to visit 
00:23:12	00:23:13	1	oh yes i'll be there 
00:23:13	00:23:25	2	then he goes to the <unk> the first day kindergarten when i first went i didn't know if i ever see you again and that was a very horrible day i'm like oh my gosh [laughter] i mean that's what he got out of it 
00:23:25	00:23:26	1	huh 
00:23:26	00:23:38	2	it's a really cute but about how a kid has you know and he says i think i'll go to australia it's cute but but um that's what carl got out of that book [laughter] oh my goodness you know you don't you don't know what kids are thinking 
00:23:40	00:23:43	2	and i didn't know that that was that stressful you know 
00:23:43	00:23:45	1	and i guess it is for a kid 
00:23:45	00:23:54	2	but you know anything but you don't know what goes through their heads then carl is very vocal about things but sarah would never tell me 
00:23:54	00:23:56	1	well she didn't talk did she 
00:23:56	00:24:05	2	she holds it all in um but she's doing really um you know she's been coated for learning disabilities at school and everything 
00:24:05	00:24:05	1	and 
00:24:21	00:24:25	1	some kids that freak out would well different sensory problems 
00:24:46	00:24:59	2	so anyways the sensory integration has been i can't tell you how much i've learned about her it would be you know like the o. t. would say to me [noise] your daughter's the type of child that does this and i would say i remember when she did that when she was two years old and 
00:24:59	00:25:04	1	you know it really it's like yeah i wasn't such a bad parent it was because 
00:25:04	00:25:07	2	of renault and she's um 
00:25:07	00:25:12	1	this neurologist it's been really good and saying you know she says there's going to be fine when she goes up but we need 
00:25:12	00:25:15	2	to make it as easy as possible for her 
00:25:15	00:25:18	1	on the teacher was saying how well sarah plans it's 
00:25:18	00:25:24	2	school and she organizes herself and that's part of her goals is organization him planning and everything 
00:25:24	00:25:27	1	and i said but you chase the plane and she will not get it 
00:25:27	00:25:38	2	first it will take her a long time and then they're all just said to us that's because they're smart enough to know that she has to organize herself in order to survive in um well 
00:25:38	00:25:41	1	she's learned some coping skills already oh she has 
00:25:41	00:25:44	2	in a matter of fact they just pushed or hadn't reading 
00:25:44	00:25:55	1	because she's doing real well but um i just learned a lot about her and i just had carl evaluate about a neurologist 'cause she said she would let us know and she said he has none of the motor 
00:25:55	00:25:58	2	that she has so it was just 
00:25:58	00:26:02	1	you know it's been nice this woman has really been on target for 
00:26:02	00:26:13	2	we've i've learned a lot and of course our insurance won't let us go for o. t. anymore but she gets it at school but it's not as nice as the one that we were seeing down in massachusetts 
00:26:13	00:26:13	1	[laughter] 
00:26:13	00:26:21	2	so come this summer i guess what we're going to do it [laughter] so we have this bungee swing in our in our basement and i'm sure you're i'm sure 
00:26:21	00:26:23	1	just love it 
00:26:23	00:26:28	2	<unk> um bounces up and down and you can swing and um it's 
00:26:28	00:26:30	1	it's really it's like a huge 
00:26:40	00:26:43	1	that's a neat idea it's i'm gonna swing in our basement 
00:26:43	00:26:55	2	yeah and he put out he figured out how to put a swim all because they use discount climbing equipment to hang things at the o._t._c. place right but my dad's figure out a way and it costs us like fifty 
00:26:55	00:26:56	1	sense yeah 
00:26:56	00:27:09	2	um it does just what it does at the place down in massachusetts where we would go so um i'm a big believer now in sensory integration i didn't know very much about it and i've learned quite a bit 
00:27:09	00:27:11	1	good so 
00:27:11	00:27:25	2	um but i am very hooked on believing that children really need to do [laughter] you know i now i can see where you know when i see kids that i take care of or whatever i <unk> said sensory integration but [laughter] 
00:27:25	00:27:30	1	[laughter] well then the thing [noise] being in the field of em are 
00:27:30	00:27:32	2	too you know i 
00:27:32	00:27:38	1	you know you you look at all these kids in the store whenever you go oh gee i wonder if that person is <unk> 
00:27:38	00:27:47	2	straight here or there you know when i get to speech therapy or or you know exactly my next door neighbor she's dealing with the kid he's got sensory integration up and 
00:27:47	00:27:50	1	and then her daughter she has 
00:27:59	00:28:00	1	and you can 
00:28:00	00:28:04	2	touched that kid lightly because she's ready to punch you out huh 
00:28:07	00:28:12	2	[laughter] yeah well that oh i wish time would take some developmental classes 
00:28:12	00:28:13	1	[noise] i mean 
00:28:13	00:28:20	2	it would help so much with jake up i mean yesterday oh we went to [noise] he wanted to go play tennis 
00:28:20	00:28:21	1	uh-huh 
00:28:21	00:28:26	2	we drive him down there and there was nobody play tennis well that was bad 
00:28:26	00:28:34	1	so i said why don't you come with us we were going to go to this factory outlet to buy christmas decorations yeah i had heard about yeah 
00:28:34	00:28:38	2	no had on can you tell her to put a hat on please sorry [laughter] 
00:28:54	00:28:59	2	place it was fine it was all right no big deal actually but we bought in lights 
00:28:59	00:29:01	1	thomas into the 
00:29:01	00:29:06	2	well we see it we might as well get it now like wait a second i can probably get it at a better place that are better 
00:29:06	00:29:08	1	yeah yeah 
00:29:08	00:29:14	2	so we get these lights and stuff well then we get in line there must have been fifteen people on line 
00:29:14	00:29:16	1	oh my god well gee 
00:29:16	00:29:22	2	he's two years old well he doesn't know how to stand still too good [laughter] yeah at times like 
00:29:25	00:29:28	2	don't touch and chicken forge 
00:29:28	00:29:31	1	[laughter] oh 
00:29:31	00:29:42	2	gosh and then times yelling at me you can't control your kids yeah you're right i wasn't going to argue with him in the <unk> it wasn't worth it you know no one no 
00:29:42	00:29:45	1	then i find that he takes 
00:29:45	00:29:57	2	most of the kids to the car [noise] so then i get out to the car and everybody's in a hippie fit out there jacob spin crying [laughter] the card tempted jacob gotta swat
