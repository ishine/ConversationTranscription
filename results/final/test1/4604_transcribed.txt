00:00:00	00:00:01	2	are you in new jersey 
00:00:01	00:00:03	1	i'm in northern new jersey in berkley high 
00:00:03	00:00:08	2	okay yeah i'm a little bit north of you in morristown oh really yeah yeah 
00:00:08	00:00:08	1	mhm mhm 
00:00:09	00:00:11	2	wow so in general how do you feel 
00:00:11	00:00:12	1	mhm 
00:00:12	00:00:15	2	well i feel my real estate taxes are exorbitant 
00:00:15	00:00:16	1	mhm 
00:00:16	00:00:20	2	and uh i think a lot of that is due to uh school taxes 
00:00:26	00:00:32	2	uh over the entire united states i think even including alaska where you might expect cost to be higher 
00:00:32	00:00:33	1	mhm 
00:00:34	00:00:38	2	and i'm not exactly sure what that can be attributed to i think it's uh 
00:00:38	00:00:39	1	of it is um 
00:00:39	00:00:44	2	uh administrative costs because ah teachers don't really get paid 
00:00:50	00:00:50	1	yeah 
00:00:50	00:00:54	2	i think it made a straight us i think we are overloaded with administrator 
00:00:58	00:01:09	2	yeah we just voted on our ah school board budget yesterday uh it passed it had a two percent increase yeah which was uh you know pretty modest um compared to the uh 
00:01:19	00:01:23	2	yeah i i think that's true i think they uh they have stabilize the uh 
00:01:30	00:01:46	2	[noise] yeah um we have um one of the highest way i'm into more school district and we have about seventy five hundred dollar per pupil expenditure which is i think um about two thousand dollars more per pupil than the state average 
00:01:46	00:01:47	1	really um 
00:01:47	00:01:49	2	but uh 
00:01:49	00:01:49	1	yeah 
00:01:49	00:02:00	2	oh i have several friends in school business administration and they all you know tell me that uh the seventy five hundred is not on the line considering the size of the district and the diversity of the population 
00:02:00	00:02:02	1	and the rich and the programs and everything yeah 
00:02:02	00:02:08	2	in fact one in particular is that was the business administration or for randolph district which was listed 
00:02:08	00:02:10	1	[noise] but one of the um by 
00:02:10	00:02:13	2	that's one of the top in the streets in that country 
00:02:13	00:02:21	1	and um but he chose to live in more school district so he could have is child go there [laughter] i was a pretty pretty strong boat in favor 
00:02:21	00:02:22	2	well i have at least that 
00:02:22	00:02:23	1	portion of our money 
00:02:23	00:02:32	2	right the quality education i think is is reasonably good i just kind of thing too much for my wife happens to be a um a learning disability 
00:02:32	00:02:33	1	mhm 
00:02:33	00:02:40	2	and um i gave her a lot of grief because it's it's one of these programs that are mandated by 
00:02:40	00:02:41	1	state mhm 
00:02:41	00:02:54	2	she does know teaching and she does a lot of paperwork and trying to screen pupils from need extra help mhm and it's it's very labor intensive and a lot of paperwork and i i i often wonder whether the 
00:02:54	00:02:55	1	mhm 
00:02:55	00:02:58	1	we're really getting their money's worth 
00:02:58	00:03:01	2	for helping these students i think they have to be helping some way um 
00:03:01	00:03:08	1	i just wondering where the process is really a fish and now she has one of the kinds of uh services that we're really paying for 
00:03:08	00:03:11	2	yeah that's that's part of the frustrating uh 
00:03:11	00:03:14	1	areas of this topic is uh 
00:03:14	00:03:17	2	i don't have a whole lot of problem with the total amount of tax 
00:03:17	00:03:19	1	i pay and i have 
00:03:45	00:03:56	2	i mean my standard of living is high and i um you know i get police protection and garbage pick up and you know what else do i need oh would i don't know though is if that tax money is being spent efficiently 
00:04:02	00:04:04	2	but i don't know overall weather 
00:04:04	00:04:08	1	uh i'm getting full value for that uh tax dollar 
00:04:08	00:04:10	2	um i just uh 
00:04:10	00:04:11	1	i don't have any 
00:04:11	00:04:14	2	way of uh really determining that 
00:04:17	00:04:23	2	down there it goes right well well they pay you gonna know we really don't know and i think um school boards 
00:04:23	00:04:25	1	um so 
00:04:38	00:04:40	2	yeah just just uh 
00:04:41	00:04:44	1	you know a couple of almost anecdotal thing 
00:04:49	00:04:50	2	which is incredible given are 
00:04:50	00:04:53	1	mhm i only the population 
00:04:53	00:04:58	2	but the density and in the territory but we have more school districts than any others
