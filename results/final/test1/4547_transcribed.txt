00:01:57	00:02:05	1	get <unk> back into the stocks i know terrible you can't find any way around it 'cause as soon as you find a way around it they start plugging up the whole

00:02:40	00:02:42	2	i teach secondary at an english oh okay 
00:02:42	00:02:49	1	and it's it's really difficult to try to figure out what you're going to do 'cause you fall right smack dab in the middle class 
00:02:49	00:02:50	2	right right 
00:02:50	00:02:52	1	<unk> the most of just about everybody 
00:03:04	00:03:07	1	most of the um you know tax stuff is under the table 
00:03:07	00:03:10	2	there you go 
00:03:10	00:03:14	1	that's the only way you can make anything now you've just been recorded thing that i know 
00:03:14	00:03:22	2	[laughter] yeah i do a little under the table and the side myself uh mostly vehicle work 
00:03:22	00:03:23	1	uh-huh yeah that's 
00:03:23	00:03:27	2	tax free stuff is nice [noise] uh not official tax free stuff 
00:03:27	00:03:35	1	right uh that's the only way to go otherwise you can't make it a threat you know they've got to come up with something and he had some of the big companies and lowered on in the middle class 
00:03:35	00:03:50	2	yeah well that's that's the thing uh there there's they've hit it's funny that they went with the i guess the reaganomics called for a trickle down theory i think that's pretty <unk> pretty much uh just proven at this point 
00:03:50	00:03:51	1	[laughter] 
00:03:51	00:03:57	2	this many years it's pretty much trashed mhm uh it's uh from what i see 
00:03:57	00:03:59	1	yeah they've got to come up with something new well 
00:03:59	00:04:12	2	have you seen the division of wealth figures lately something like the top one percent have the top some ungodly are the top one percent have forty percent are the top ten percent have forty percent of the wealth 
00:04:12	00:04:13	1	mhm 
00:04:13	00:04:17	2	and like the top one percent have like twenty five percent or 
00:04:17	00:04:18	1	right right 
00:04:18	00:04:29	2	and it's just getting worse for the <unk> this attack structure mhm so that's exactly it will just same as the new tax colds that just came out if you make over a hundred and seventy five 
00:04:42	00:04:45	1	they always they always cry that um you know 
00:04:45	00:04:54	2	well you know if you'd tax originally you're actually not getting that much money 'cause there aren't that many of them whereas you're getting a lot of money from from the uh from all the 
00:04:54	00:04:56	1	middle class 
00:04:56	00:04:59	2	because even though you're taking less from each one there's so many more
