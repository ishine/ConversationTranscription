00:00:05	00:00:08	2	well i think i'll go for it 
00:00:08	00:00:13	1	right no no exciting conversation 
00:00:13	00:00:24	2	[laughter] well i was wondering how much uh we'd be able to talk about if your family's around anyway well they'll just have to live with it [laughter] 
00:00:24	00:00:32	1	yeah so well let's see now where did we leave off 
00:00:32	00:00:38	2	oh gee i guess i could start with your email address 
00:00:38	00:00:40	1	oh my email it does 
00:00:40	00:00:41	2	yeah 
00:00:41	00:00:47	1	you can reach me at uh rio diet a._o._l. dot com 
00:00:47	00:00:56	2	um yeah i tried sending something to you on that d._w._i. e._e._o. at a._o._l. 
00:00:56	00:01:00	1	d. w. e. l. yeah at a._o._l. dot com 
00:01:00	00:01:15	2	dot com yeah okay that work well i sent it so let me know if you receive it right i didn't get any message back saying a user unknown or whatever it is a known address 
00:01:15	00:01:17	1	okay 
00:01:17	00:01:19	2	so i presume that it went through 
00:01:19	00:01:20	1	mhm 
00:01:20	00:01:30	2	[noise] and ah you were saying that uh that's uh one of <unk> andersons yet like an idea of of his a._o._l. account 
00:01:30	00:01:33	1	mhm so 
00:01:35	00:01:40	1	my friend ridge scranton sent me he's writing some software for this guy whose part of the uh 
00:01:40	00:01:58	2	low ball he's got this thing called the global [noise] or something or other network and it's a multi level marketing um internet service 
00:01:58	00:02:01	1	kind of thing mhm 
00:02:01	00:02:11	2	but so i might get onto the net that way and um [noise] you know i'll let you know says that address becomes 
00:02:11	00:02:13	1	oh okay 
00:02:13	00:02:18	2	there's also supposedly you know a magazine lifting all of the 
00:02:18	00:02:25	2	internet service providers here in denver which i need to still look over 
00:02:25	00:02:30	1	mm how <unk> what those um cost 
00:02:30	00:02:59	2	uh generally uh runs about yeah i've heard of things as low as twenty dollars a month actually there's this one place the bulletin board which allows uh they're i guess trying to attract new people so it's like twenty five dollars for the first year but in general i think syria is um access providers generally charge about twenty dollars a month 
00:02:59	00:03:01	1	nice 
00:03:01	00:03:36	2	right you can go up from their depending on how much volume you expect to be using uh last year it was like seventy five dollars for a slip account which is like this like you know dedicated a line between your computer and there is um now there's i think they've prices on down to about forty dollars a month so i still need to do some more looking either all just kind of you know uh here 
00:03:36	00:03:37	1	mhm 
00:03:37	00:03:40	2	mhm 
00:03:40	00:03:48	1	mm mm and where are you telling me once that you had a electronic news service through your computer 
00:03:48	00:04:21	2	yeah i used to have um scenic which is um santa cruz operations version of unix installed on my sweetie sick and um it has you know i've been reading and figured it back to adopt machine we use it or um you know burning he from you know doing kind of low level ah development kinds of things on it 
00:04:21	00:04:23	1	what was the other thing you said 
00:04:23	00:04:28	2	he probably programming eat them yeah 
00:04:28	00:04:30	1	but is that 
00:04:30	00:04:43	2	civil program of over eat only memory does not modify viable unless you use a higher voltage hence the term to burn a chip you you have the 
00:04:45	00:04:51	2	as a special socket you drop the chip in too and you then 
00:04:51	00:04:52	1	mhm 
00:04:52	00:04:58	2	it then raises the voltage out to about well depending on the chip in anywhere from twelve to twenty five <unk> 
00:04:58	00:04:59	1	mhm 
00:04:59	00:05:06	2	normal operating voltage is it five old though at the higher voltage it uh 
00:05:06	00:05:09	1	mhm 
00:05:09	00:05:38	2	i forget the exact physics of it but you end up um kind of like in that just got you know you you put them even if you burn zeros and do it it starts out being all one and then you for instance zero and then you <unk> you use ultra violet light too um just lodge electrons and then you know you raised as it back to one 
00:05:38	00:05:40	1	oh and then there's also 
00:05:49	00:05:50	1	mhm 
00:05:50	00:06:12	2	so it's kind of uh you know it takes about depending on the chip you know and the strength of the eraser anywhere from five to twenty minutes to erase it you know and then you've got to download the program to the programmer and then it burns it in so you know the whole thing and take you know a bit of time 
00:06:12	00:06:14	1	mhm but it's uh 
00:06:14	00:06:20	2	you know it's a good way to you know make changes the system is messed coughing on that show 
00:06:20	00:06:22	1	mhm 
00:06:22	00:06:23	2	mhm 
00:06:23	00:06:24	1	mhm 
00:06:24	00:06:37	2	and um you know so we've got any problem programmer we've got a programmer for you know micro controllers which also has <unk> in um 
00:06:37	00:06:38	1	mhm um 
00:06:38	00:06:43	2	that kinda thing 
00:06:43	00:06:44	1	mhm 
00:06:44	00:06:54	2	oh another thing we use it for is uh like a bloody and downloading programs from the h. p. for t. h. e. graphic calculator 
00:06:54	00:06:57	1	mhm 
00:06:57	00:07:16	2	it's good we uh you know it's it's cheaper to buy a an h. p. and to program it than it is to buy uh l._c._d. screen and and then uh assemble all over thirty three are required to drive uh 
00:07:16	00:07:17	1	mhm 
00:07:17	00:07:28	2	so for any kind of a system where you need a just like a little user interface you know like if he's had an uh screen with a few lines of taxes on it uh it's just more you know it's 
00:07:28	00:07:30	1	mhm 
00:07:30	00:07:38	2	and uh so that's another thing we use it for us you know like a floating 
00:07:38	00:07:40	1	programs from from the calculator 
00:07:40	00:07:42	2	mhm 
00:07:42	00:07:43	1	mhm 
00:07:43	00:08:04	2	that reminds me one thing that i'm looking for now is um some kind of a typewriter that's maybe real light and portable where i could type a document and then um uh apply it to a computer or or even just save it to a desk if i don't know if there's typewriters that do that 
00:08:04	00:08:07	1	um yeah 
00:08:13	00:08:15	1	mm um 
00:08:15	00:08:26	2	you may be better off finding a cheap laptop you know i use my or find to use two eighty six or used three eighty six laptop 
00:08:26	00:08:33	1	<unk> again yeah how much those go funny you know uh 
00:08:40	00:08:42	1	mhm 
00:08:42	00:08:46	2	and and some of these uh affordable typewriters are going to cost as much 
00:08:46	00:08:48	1	mhm 
00:08:48	00:08:50	2	and then not be standard 
00:08:50	00:09:00	1	right mhm yeah i was hoping i could get something for two hundred that sounds like they might not be anything 
00:09:00	00:09:30	2	[noise] there are things and you just you really have to like keep your eye open like maybe go and buy a copy of computer shop or you know and then it's like you're gonna spend all day like you know saturday morning you buy computer shopper and then you spend the rest of the day flipping through you know you know it's like an inch and a half sick you know it's this oversized this this gargantuan you know saying just full of nothing but as you know and they they still use equipment they've got the fairly comprehensive set of indexes now 
00:09:30	00:09:32	1	mhm 
00:09:32	00:09:47	2	easy to track down like it'll give you a list of all the use hardware vendors and then you just kind of look at each one of them and you know have a pet a paper ready so you can take notes and you probably wanna little you know had posted seeking tear often make little book smart 
00:09:47	00:09:48	1	mhm 
00:09:48	00:09:58	2	mm no then you've got to go on call 'em all so i mean you're going to take a while you really want you know you're you're going to spend any time you don't spend that money 
00:09:58	00:09:59	1	mhm 
00:09:59	00:10:02	2	but you know it is possible to find good deals 
00:10:02	00:10:05	1	mhm 
00:10:05	00:10:11	2	another choices like um <unk> for sale 
00:10:11	00:10:11	1	mhm 
00:10:11	00:10:14	2	on the using that 
00:10:14	00:10:17	1	mhm 
00:10:17	00:10:33	2	using that news but you know that's another option and then of course every so often you know someone wants to unload a computer through the sunday uh i mean um this girl i was seeing for 
00:10:33	00:10:40	1	mostly carmen ended up buying a a mac perform uh for like five hundred and fifty bucks 
00:10:55	00:10:59	1	software you know all you know and and back so 
00:10:59	00:11:01	2	sounds pretty good 
00:11:01	00:11:02	1	that was a good deal 
00:11:02	00:11:06	2	yeah for five fifty 
00:11:14	00:11:16	2	yeah he was 
00:11:31	00:11:35	1	yeah they <unk> they usually have some good bargains 
00:11:35	00:11:40	2	yeah i should probably just go to that and eventually it'll probably be a laptop and turned on 
00:11:40	00:11:42	1	mhm 
00:11:42	00:11:46	2	[noise] actually i think there were some laptops out uh 
00:11:46	00:11:51	1	uh one of your friends you know knock himself off and you know get all this stuff 
00:11:51	00:11:57	2	[laughter] oh no [laughter] 
00:11:57	00:12:01	1	oh yeah now that the the suitable period for giving his past now i'm allowed to 
00:12:01	00:12:09	2	mm yeah yeah yeah well 
00:12:09	00:12:29	1	mm <unk> gus gus is putting out a web page for his company w. s. t. and he's you know he he it's very um he's very <unk> like all about it i'm i'm not sure if he expects to really get any business doing it or not but it's you know you know there's like pictures of everyone 
00:12:29	00:12:38	2	there's a picture of me and i've got this you know expression on my like my clients and you know my eyes open really wide and 
00:12:38	00:12:40	1	[laughter] 
00:12:40	00:13:00	2	take care of another guy was you know like face almost up into the camera and hung out and you know different people in different poses and got it got like took his picture into the into uh the like the video pain um application 
00:13:00	00:13:02	1	mhm 
00:13:02	00:13:25	2	yeah to him to his head and then underneath each one is like you know it's like <unk> you know and it doesn't you know mood swings <unk> shoot fire davey think walks do all in black attends rockies games join yamaguchi high i._q. on missions 
00:13:25	00:13:38	1	and then he's got this little drawing of a bunch of die in a shape of uh you know it looks like a pile of something and it says rob mcallen underneath and says i tend to stay on 
00:13:59	00:14:03	1	uh-huh it's a good name 
00:14:03	00:14:11	2	and so you know he's basically a contractor and everyone who works with him as a contractor 
00:14:11	00:14:13	1	right 
00:14:13	00:14:14	2	mhm 
00:14:14	00:14:17	1	huh wow interesting 
00:14:17	00:14:17	2	mhm 
00:14:17	00:14:21	1	so are you are making ends meet 
00:14:21	00:14:25	2	well um yeah i'm kind of hanging in there 
00:14:31	00:14:39	2	making me wonder how i'm going to uh pull the money together 
00:14:39	00:14:40	1	pay rent and that kind of thing 
00:14:40	00:14:41	2	huh 
00:14:41	00:14:43	1	pay rent and and that 
00:14:57	00:14:59	2	um 
00:14:59	00:15:03	1	mhm 
00:15:03	00:15:16	2	um yeah we'll see i mean it's one of the parts that got sent to me doesn't do what the they said it would you know so i have to they're saying i have to weigh too 
00:15:16	00:15:19	1	to get a you know a different part that will 
00:15:19	00:15:22	2	work mhm 
00:15:22	00:15:25	1	point i'm inclined to start looking around for another <unk> 
00:15:25	00:15:26	2	flyer mhm 
00:15:26	00:15:28	1	and um 
00:15:28	00:15:29	2	mhm 
00:15:29	00:15:33	1	you know it it it's gonna be kind of a close call because 
00:15:33	00:15:47	2	living expenses don't stop and so the project gets delayed you know i have to start you know spending some of the money you just you know keeping alive and uh 
00:15:47	00:15:49	1	so it's gonna be uh 
00:15:49	00:15:59	2	shave but i think i'll be able to get through they virtue of i've got one robs clients is now uh i go on to me for business 
00:15:59	00:15:59	1	mhm 
00:15:59	00:16:02	2	[noise] um 
00:16:02	00:16:07	1	so you're doing consulting on your own and discuss 
00:16:07	00:16:14	2	yeah right now guess doesn't have any projects he's trying to put together a product that basically uh 
00:16:14	00:16:15	1	multiple 
00:16:15	00:16:27	2	uh addresses on a single ours to thirty two line which uh you know if you're familiar with the <unk> part of an i._b._m. 
00:16:27	00:16:28	1	um 
00:16:28	00:16:41	2	ordinarily you can plug one thing into a calm port and using this device that were coming up with it'll be possible to have multiple devices on a single come for it 
00:16:41	00:16:42	1	mhm 
00:16:42	00:16:48	2	and uh [noise] so you know we're in the past 
00:16:48	00:16:52	1	of verifying with him attic and producing these boards and then 
00:17:03	00:17:05	1	and uh 
00:17:05	00:17:13	2	you know it should come in it's it's kind of like you know on the the apple macintosh the desktop uh has uh 
00:17:13	00:17:18	1	the desktop what by bus oh huh 
00:17:18	00:17:20	2	you have uh things like 
00:17:20	00:17:21	1	you know the mouse 
00:17:21	00:17:37	2	attract ball a keyboard extra keep had you know you can plug all kinds of little things into the into the you know they have this special plug shaped worked with the maxine another keyboards plug in 
00:17:37	00:17:39	1	okay 
00:17:39	00:17:55	2	you can have up to sixteen devices running on the apple desktop buff and so you know we were just looking to produce a similar kind of a situation using uh you know they are two thirty to calm port uh i._b._m. 
00:17:55	00:17:58	1	[noise] 
00:17:58	00:17:59	2	so 
00:17:59	00:18:03	1	mhm 
00:18:03	00:18:10	2	but that one's not you know that's kinda like you know we have to start marketing it and we won't 
00:18:10	00:18:11	1	mhm 
00:18:11	00:18:18	2	you know we'll probably be a little while before we actually start realizing any kind of uh 
00:18:18	00:18:20	1	no income yeah yeah 
00:18:20	00:18:22	2	from that sort so 
00:18:22	00:18:25	1	yeah 
00:18:25	00:18:29	2	so it's it's um it'll be a little bit of work 
00:18:29	00:18:32	1	mhm mhm 
00:18:32	00:18:33	2	mhm 
00:18:33	00:18:40	1	meanwhile it's not stopping me i i've got together with a few people and uh so that you know i was interested in 
00:18:40	00:18:45	2	living in in uh intentional community and so we're actually looking at 
00:18:45	00:18:48	1	um 
00:18:48	00:18:49	2	buying some place 
00:18:49	00:18:50	1	mhm 
00:18:50	00:18:52	2	and uh 
00:18:52	00:18:54	1	mhm 
00:18:54	00:18:59	2	you know having enough room for people plus a little extra room and uh 
00:18:59	00:19:00	1	mhm 
00:19:15	00:19:17	1	um 
00:19:17	00:19:22	2	yoga contracts or mhm so 
00:19:22	00:19:24	1	did i mentioned this before 
00:19:37	00:19:39	1	um talks a little bit about 
00:19:39	00:19:57	2	[noise] something like that um with some of her friends um not <unk> maybe not with such emphasis on uh um you know exploring uh mental state and that kind of thing 
00:19:57	00:20:15	1	um although that you know would probably be um part of the spiritual life of the community and uh yeah i was wondering um where uh would you where are you planning on doing this and 
00:20:15	00:20:15	2	mhm 
00:20:15	00:20:18	1	are there are quite a few or five or 
00:20:18	00:20:22	2	we got we got for people who are 
00:20:22	00:20:23	1	uh-huh 
00:20:23	00:20:41	2	committed to it and and there was another person who uh you know express some interest initially and then kind of backed off and she's decided that she's kind of attached to her apartment and 
00:20:41	00:20:42	1	you know 
00:20:42	00:20:43	2	yeah 
00:20:43	00:20:53	1	having your own space and and she's got she teaches voice lessons and so she's afraid that she'd lose some clientele she moved 
00:20:53	00:21:00	2	mhm and uh two which i responded well of course there aren't any students anywhere else in the world 
00:21:00	00:21:01	1	mhm 
00:21:05	00:21:08	1	that you know she she's 
00:21:17	00:21:18	1	mhm 
00:21:18	00:21:47	2	you know and she she could choose to you know eliminate those but you know people who are more invested in uh let's see how do i want to put the most people get wrapped up in their emotions about things and that generally keeps them like stock or they are 
00:21:47	00:21:48	1	mhm 
00:21:48	00:21:51	2	yeah it it seems to be 
00:21:51	00:21:52	1	mhm 
00:21:52	00:22:05	2	the emotions behind something and just just my own take on it you know i mean i know that like in their linguistic programming there was a focus on the beliefs but i think that um 
00:22:05	00:22:06	1	[noise] 
00:22:06	00:22:08	2	um 
00:22:08	00:22:08	1	yeah 
00:22:08	00:22:27	2	leaves you know beliefs are just thought that is the fact that you i guess have some emotional company man that i think that's generally what keeps keeps things in place 
00:22:27	00:22:27	1	mhm 
00:22:27	00:23:01	2	um which is kind of um you know the root for believe is the same as the root for love and so i think that i think that kind of telling i mean i don't i don't know you know people nowadays probably don't necessarily attached to two words but you can see that you know like they hold some you know they hold some opinion you know as if it were that true 
00:23:01	00:23:02	1	and uh 
00:23:02	00:23:25	2	you know and one of the most prevalent ones seems to be like the like the supremacy of emotion like whatever i'm feeling must be the way things really are you know kind of like uh trust your got kind of 
00:23:25	00:23:27	1	mhm 
00:23:27	00:23:33	2	and that um you know like whatever emotions or feelings they have about something 
00:23:41	00:23:47	2	mhm mhm 
00:24:02	00:24:07	2	i guess i have a belief myself which is that 
00:24:07	00:24:13	1	um you know it's 
00:24:13	00:24:19	2	i think that most people kind of get the cart before the horse you know they decided to go for these 
00:24:19	00:24:20	1	mhm 
00:24:20	00:24:29	2	you know mystical approaches to life or whatever and they or their needs philosophy you know something like greater than um and 
00:24:29	00:24:30	1	mhm 
00:24:30	00:24:39	2	i know that the tools that people think that that uh you know like part of the steps on the road to recovery 
00:24:39	00:24:43	1	say that last thing against something like <unk> 
00:24:43	00:24:44	2	i'm sorry 
00:24:44	00:24:49	1	i didn't catch that you said something about it's something like dragging this um 
00:24:49	00:24:50	2	mhm 
00:24:50	00:24:50	1	mhm 
00:24:50	00:24:58	2	oh i wasn't sure what you said and it was before you were talking about the <unk> 
00:24:58	00:24:59	1	um 
00:24:59	00:25:03	2	district definitely uh 
00:25:03	00:25:05	1	mhm 
00:25:05	00:25:08	2	what did i say my poor short term memory 
00:25:08	00:25:10	1	something like something is um 
00:25:10	00:25:13	2	oh it's just you know the 
00:25:13	00:25:15	1	mhm 
00:25:15	00:25:17	2	i don't know just you know like a bully 
00:25:17	00:25:18	1	in something 
00:25:18	00:25:20	2	mhm 
00:25:20	00:25:23	1	you know hire outside of one so 
00:25:23	00:25:27	2	uh-huh mysticism mhm 
00:25:27	00:25:30	1	yeah maybe i know i said that earlier 
00:25:30	00:25:37	2	yeah um 
00:25:37	00:25:42	1	yeah so anyway twelve step people 
00:25:42	00:25:49	2	well for them it seems like it's useful to have some kind of a structure because they don't seem to be able to hold anything in place for themselves 
00:25:49	00:25:51	1	uh-huh it seems 
00:25:51	00:25:53	1	uh 
00:25:53	00:25:55	2	you know so they moved from 
00:25:55	00:25:56	1	position of 
00:25:56	00:26:01	2	you know disarray and to some order but you can get just as 
00:26:05	00:26:10	2	as you can on your whim 
00:26:10	00:26:12	1	yeah 
00:26:21	00:26:34	2	well about reality ultimately like what you should do you know people get all i'm just thinking of like a friend of mine michael and and he he 
00:26:34	00:26:36	1	well seeing this girl that they were 
00:26:38	00:26:40	1	quite a while i think back in high school 
00:26:40	00:26:43	2	and then they kind of like sort of 
00:26:43	00:26:48	1	i had a reunion uh you know they kind of ran into each other 
00:26:48	00:26:52	2	and this is michael <unk> yeah uh-huh 
00:26:52	00:26:57	1	and they were going out and seeing each other for a while but she's kind of got this thing about 
00:26:57	00:26:58	2	mhm 
00:26:58	00:27:00	1	you know this 
00:27:00	00:27:00	2	yeah 
00:27:00	00:27:05	1	she's got the sensitivity thing it's hard to i don't know if there's like us 
00:27:05	00:27:13	2	specific name for it but it's kinda like you know it's kind of like she's got you know like these sensitive emotions you know and 
00:27:13	00:27:14	1	mhm 
00:27:14	00:27:15	2	um you know she can't bear to 
00:27:15	00:27:19	1	have um um 
00:27:19	00:27:21	2	infringed upon 
00:27:21	00:27:22	1	mhm 
00:27:22	00:27:26	2	and so it's like whatever 
00:27:26	00:27:27	1	[noise] 
00:27:27	00:27:28	2	um 
00:27:28	00:27:32	1	mhm 
00:27:32	00:27:45	2	but you know it's like so whatever you know gives her a bad feelings you know she like students' clear instead of you know <unk> organizing herself to be powerful in a situation 
00:27:45	00:27:46	1	mhm 
00:27:46	00:27:50	2	um she lets her 
00:27:50	00:27:56	1	you know she's just let these emotions kind of like be the ultimate test of reality 
00:27:56	00:27:57	2	mhm 
00:27:57	00:28:01	1	and since they're bad bad feelings then you know 
00:28:01	00:28:02	2	mhm 
00:28:02	00:28:06	1	her her reaction is to sort of withdraw from the situation 
00:28:06	00:28:09	2	yeah 
00:28:09	00:28:14	1	no you know it's just it's just the same kind of thing it's like people get invested in 
00:28:14	00:28:22	2	you know comfort 
00:28:22	00:28:23	1	and uh 
00:28:23	00:28:29	2	you know keeps them 
00:28:35	00:28:36	2	mhm 
00:28:36	00:28:39	1	it'd be no more development because they're more interested in their comforts 
00:28:39	00:28:46	2	mhm so it just kinda for some reason irritates me 
00:28:46	00:28:47	1	mhm 
00:28:47	00:28:49	2	yeah well you 
00:28:49	00:28:50	1	[noise] 
00:28:50	00:28:57	2	do you uh you know i've [noise] seems like you place a pretty high value on flexibility and um 
00:28:57	00:28:58	1	[noise] 
00:28:58	00:29:03	2	development continuing to develop and the thing that's something i value 
00:29:03	00:29:04	1	i guess it's 
00:29:04	00:29:06	2	kind of like disappointment because it's like 
00:29:06	00:29:08	1	you know you're going along and 
00:29:08	00:29:10	2	just like drop out like 
00:29:10	00:29:11	1	want to play anymore 
00:29:11	00:29:23	2	yeah well it's kind of like a disappointment like they'd rather have their emotions you know then you know some kind of related nuts 
00:29:23	00:29:25	1	mhm 
00:29:25	00:29:30	2	so i find that disappointing 
00:29:30	00:29:32	1	yeah 
00:29:32	00:29:36	2	mhm 
00:29:36	00:29:37	1	mhm

00:29:44	00:29:52	2	well one of the five is this girl who is uh i guess pretty much decided to stay in her own apartment
