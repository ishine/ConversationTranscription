00:05:44	00:05:45	2	yeah 
00:05:45	00:05:47	1	<unk> yeah i think so too 
00:05:52	00:06:04	2	[noise] like it had like this little like another little touch something on it said you were supposed to use mhm and i use it the first time for like three seconds so i was like [laughter] [laughter] 
00:06:04	00:06:14	1	really [laughter] don't ever do that again and i forget what it said it was four i think it said it was for a few it's small breasts or something i don't know i took that thing and 
00:06:14	00:06:22	2	[laughter] it was like a little part you put on top of the novel thing was just like an extra time and i took that night what a way okay 
00:06:22	00:06:26	1	okay yeah 
00:06:26	00:06:31	2	that's indoor fine if you if you could avoid it you know it was 
00:06:31	00:06:33	1	in your life to say 
00:06:38	00:06:46	1	take it easy and if i'm not sleeping at night and i was asleep during the day or sleep when the baby please not do this whole bumping thing i mean if i had to do it all over and that's what i would 
00:06:46	00:06:52	2	oh yeah because i was thinking it would be easier 'cause then other people could feed the baby and you wouldn't have to be so tied to it 
00:06:52	00:06:58	1	yeah if you want to go out to a movie or something we <unk> we never go you know in northern ireland 
00:06:58	00:07:04	2	believe me when you have a baby you what do you want to put it in someone else's house or someone come much in your house and go anywhere 
00:07:04	00:07:14	1	see that's what i was thinking like for my inlaws and stuff when we go home for christmas well it would be so nice to just you know leave the baby with them but you can't leave a baby 
00:07:14	00:07:31	2	yeah i mean you know you might have to try one or two before you find one that works yeah once you know they have like things like that the tension or whatever [laughter] [laughter] the power level

00:08:02	00:08:05	1	okay and you can reuse the plastic container and then 
00:08:05	00:08:22	2	i would do is just uh i would bring little bags like that you're supposed to put formula and with me to work okay and then i pour it from the container into the plastic bag and fill it up and then go you know rents out the thinking wash it and did you throw away the plastic bags when you were done

00:14:59	00:15:08	2	[noise] she was like well yeah i <unk> i kind of thought that that is what was happening so i think that she's you know she's really good at at doing that kinda thing 
00:15:08	00:15:12	1	i mean she certainly has plenty flies but i i don't think so 
00:15:12	00:15:20	2	um <unk> you know i told you that when i was really mad that she said that was all mets work but man had talked to her about and stuff so 
00:15:20	00:15:23	1	and that's been able to pull the wool over eyes at least once 
00:15:23	00:15:27	2	[noise] yeah but that's just because you weren't there to talk about it 
00:15:27	00:15:32	1	so i think sometimes me infinitely forget a bill or something no sooner than working um 
00:15:32	00:15:35	2	getting paid poor [laughter]

00:15:58	00:16:02	1	become completely off i can't just eight year old 
00:16:02	00:16:14	2	there's too many people in my house [noise] too many things going on some of my new house in providence there i can just stand there all day 'cause it's a nice big house will be enough room so they can have my own room for my sewing and things but here 
00:16:14	00:16:17	1	i need to get out of the house but it's the perfect 
00:16:17	00:16:24	2	<unk> and you have a whole year i would look at it as a year of totally like forgetting about pittsburgh and trying to focus on um 
00:16:24	00:16:27	1	providence and figuring out what you want to do there 
00:16:27	00:16:37	2	if i can get some experience with them pittsburgh school like i said uh providence and like <unk> what i'd done you feel like oh i've been working in the schools in pittsburgh during blah 
00:16:37	00:16:40	1	blah blah blah [laughter] uh-huh so what kind of 
00:16:40	00:16:52	2	oh no that's the problem uh-huh it'd be like a teacher of users person sounds when they come to me and say i don't want to do a collaborative learning project in my geography class and we're going to talk about this what should we do 
00:16:52	00:16:58	1	mhm and um do you want to work through the university or uh or the universities in boston or um

00:20:01	00:20:03	1	oh my god that they offer wouldn't that be 
00:20:03	00:20:07	2	that that'd be like even worse than being in front of it right 
00:20:07	00:20:14	1	<unk> in some ways i mean that would be depressing but at least you'd know you wouldn't have to go through all the treatments and the trying and

00:21:35	00:21:39	1	you should see this october november last there's all these people you know it's like

00:21:57	00:22:05	2	minimalist him when it comes to this medical stuff i learned about medicine procedures the more i realize that uh

00:22:35	00:22:38	1	every family doctor you know doesn't really believe that 
00:22:38	00:22:44	2	that's true till they try it either it's a well known 
00:22:44	00:22:47	1	fact that everyone should be well aware of 
00:22:47	00:22:49	2	you know 
00:22:49	00:22:52	1	it's just so weird to me now well you know doctors 
00:22:52	00:22:54	2	i have read it in the book somewhere 
00:22:54	00:23:02	1	actors are stupid doctors aren't scientists doctor's like what'd you do is they learn a buddy of knowledge and they learn how to apply it you know 
00:23:02	00:23:05	2	she really believes it now because she tried it 
00:23:05	00:23:07	1	this one person he had to have her own personal <unk> 
00:23:07	00:23:17	2	they don't um evaluate evidence at all doctors are totally not scientist would they do is they learn a body of evidence and then they they learn to apply it that's that's it 
00:23:17	00:23:19	1	but it seems to me you know they all have very 
00:23:19	00:23:32	2	experience and all the decisions you know if they have to choose between basing it on the one person they've ever met before has the same thing or statistical evidence of millions of people they base it on the one person they knew i had it before 
00:23:32	00:23:36	1	well they haven't been taught to reason statistically at all you know and even like 
00:23:49	00:23:50	1	yeah everyone in my 
00:23:50	00:23:52	2	it's wrong way i can you have the old

00:24:45	00:24:56	2	i'm sorry you know there's just it's just so funny like uh i think it's meal sweep it under the carpet and we're going to assume it's going to go away solution 
00:24:56	00:24:58	1	i think has about is the road 
00:24:58	00:25:05	2	so oh i mean yeah right like like tasting step in and fruit i mean not that i'm trying to be gross or anything

00:26:07	00:26:08	1	that's like 
00:26:25	00:26:30	1	i mean you definitely don't want to undergraduate so i would like they'd rip the plays a part you'd have to do twice as much renovation 
00:26:30	00:26:38	2	kevin definitely would like to have no one rented and i sort of feel like well this one to keep an eye and the place and noticed that the roof leagues and 
00:26:38	00:26:41	1	you know but i really don't want young children

00:26:44	00:26:47	1	[noise] that's true maybe seen is a graduate student or someone 
00:26:47	00:26:58	2	i mean you could maybe have someone just uh you know stay in it or maybe you know pay someone minimum minimum amount of money to go and check once a week or something like that 
00:26:58	00:27:04	1	we have our babysitter hearing goes to brown such a thing for at least we can have argued that go by once a week 
00:27:04	00:27:10	2	it's a really good idea and that would work out okay 
00:27:10	00:27:14	1	it's still not even clear whether it in a closed before or after september first um 
00:27:14	00:27:17	2	uh-huh that's far up in the air that can be
