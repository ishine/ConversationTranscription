00:08:17	00:08:20	1	that must have <unk> yeah they <unk> 
00:08:20	00:08:25	2	wrote a book about it mhm so you see american 
00:08:25	00:08:27	1	no he's he's english 
00:08:27	00:08:31	2	uh-huh [noise] interesting so arabic must be really good 
00:08:31	00:08:34	1	it's perfect it's not any better than mine 
00:08:34	00:08:42	2	well your arm because really good it's it's all it's gotten pretty good actually i've learned some interesting stuff here this year 
00:08:48	00:08:51	1	not at all because um 
00:08:51	00:09:00	2	yeah i think you have you have to for one thing you have to be a lot better at arabic than i am to do it but um mostly where we spend 
00:09:00	00:09:01	1	most of our time on translates 
00:09:01	00:09:03	2	and <unk> and 
00:09:03	00:09:06	1	only a very little bit on interpreting and the interpreting we do 
00:09:06	00:09:09	2	is is a consecutive 
00:09:09	00:09:12	1	liaison interpreting what does that mean 
00:09:12	00:09:25	2	it means that um you you actually well you'd you'd do it by paragraphs mhm small small sort of small bits of speech and 
00:09:25	00:09:29	1	in some ways it's harder than simultaneous 
00:09:29	00:09:32	2	um because 
00:09:32	00:09:38	1	you have to not only remember what was said but you have to get all the facts 
00:09:38	00:09:41	2	right right yeah i remember at all and yeah 
00:09:41	00:09:47	1	date and amount and you know so there's um there's a lot of 
00:09:47	00:09:54	2	that's in note taking and device in your own sort of set of symbols that will job 
00:09:54	00:09:57	1	your memory you know because you can't you can't keep notes 
00:10:10	00:10:17	2	and then make a note of any sort of date or amount right and that's it and when you look at 
00:10:17	00:10:19	1	that it should it should 
00:10:19	00:10:21	2	jog your memory and 
00:10:21	00:10:23	1	sort of reconstruct the whole 
00:10:33	00:10:35	1	and i love it [laughter] 
00:10:35	00:10:41	2	just going to ask suicide from from being really busy though it sounds like it's a really good program in your learning a lot well 
00:10:41	00:10:43	1	it's it's an 
00:10:43	00:10:58	2	okay program i think they're horribly underfunded and in some ways they had a lot of nerve advertising themselves as a translation programs for non native speakers of arabic but 
00:11:07	00:11:09	1	you know i mean that 
00:11:50	00:11:51	1	up to them all that 
00:11:51	00:11:53	2	perhaps that you know 
00:11:53	00:11:55	1	i was in jordan both both 
00:11:55	00:11:58	2	both springtime i made 
00:11:58	00:12:03	1	every body collect all the junk they got out of the things 
00:12:03	00:12:05	2	bought you know every time 
00:12:05	00:12:07	1	i remember every time somebody went to a safe way and they 
00:12:07	00:12:21	2	it's something that had you know at a product advertisement on it i mean give it to me and i've collected all that crap and do you know that it is exactly the kind of stuff but that they need to have it in the line 
00:12:37	00:12:40	1	this what you're doing your your masters thing on 
00:12:40	00:12:46	2	no actually i'm doing a mind on some title and [laughter] you know 
00:12:46	00:12:50	1	from arabic english from arabic english yes 
00:12:50	00:12:55	2	films do you have that you're working with i'm only working on one which is 
00:12:55	00:13:09	1	and it's it's so cool there was a documentary here recently <unk> on um did i tell you this already on on on <unk> female bodyguard 
00:13:09	00:13:14	2	<unk> oh my god have you ever heard of them no oh 
00:13:14	00:13:16	1	jokes if i never had either this 
00:13:16	00:13:30	2	it was so interesting he set up a military academy from girls yeah of course it's the only one in the arab world and they they get uh like a college education through it 
00:13:30	00:13:34	1	and then they have military training and may become his 
00:13:34	00:13:35	2	body guards 
00:13:35	00:13:37	1	what does he have any men as well or just 
00:13:37	00:13:52	2	well apparently he does i think in some ways i think it's for show and in other ways i think it might be his own you know sort of entourage yeah or whatever [laughter] kind of exciting 
00:13:52	00:13:58	1	but any way the the one of the channels here did a documentary and 
00:13:58	00:14:02	2	what i'm looking at is the um 
00:14:02	00:14:03	1	yeah 
00:14:03	00:14:10	2	but some of the pragmatic aspects of of <unk> of translating for subtitles wing 
00:14:10	00:14:19	1	but also where <unk> come then oh which is the origin of the people making the thing 
00:14:19	00:14:31	2	right right mhm because there's so much left out of the translation horse sure some things added to the translation <unk> but then but then 
00:14:33	00:14:35	2	constructed 
00:14:35	00:14:38	1	of course make you laugh at <unk> and 
00:14:38	00:14:49	2	think that the arabs are make you think that the arabs or not you know right right and um so what i'm doing is i'm going to look at some of the ways that that done 
00:14:52	00:14:54	1	really interesting yeah 
00:14:54	00:14:57	2	i i'm finding it very interesting so 
00:14:57	00:15:01	1	something that that's like that you know i mean that yeah keeps you going and 
00:15:01	00:15:03	2	yeah 
00:15:03	00:15:04	1	and do it every day 
00:15:04	00:15:06	2	yeah 
00:15:06	00:15:11	1	so anyway so tell me why you want to quit out of it [laughter] 
00:15:11	00:15:27	2	[noise] well it's not not that i want to quit arabic and i'm just tired of doing what i'm doing i don't feel like it's it's all that interesting and i don't know i want to be doing something productive and i don't feel like this is you know why 
00:15:27	00:15:31	1	but why don't you you don't like it is you mean because 
00:15:31	00:15:36	2	well you know i mean i'm at that point where i have to be self directed 
00:15:36	00:15:37	1	oh and 
00:15:37	00:15:48	2	i do so much better when somebody says here go read these things and assimilate them and respond to them and you know that kind of thing 
00:15:48	00:15:50	1	and so yeah i know 
00:16:15	00:16:21	2	language e yeah so nothing nothing cultural really 
00:16:21	00:16:22	1	no and that's well 
00:16:34	00:16:35	1	yeah 
00:16:44	00:16:46	1	[noise] um 
00:16:46	00:16:52	2	what are the best ways to get them to be saying in the lab but i want them to say in the right register and that sort of thing 
00:16:52	00:16:53	1	yeah 
00:16:53	00:16:58	2	i think i i'm i'm really wanting to to just teach and 
00:16:58	00:17:01	1	it just seems so far removed from that 
00:17:01	00:17:13	2	you know you could you could if you were in britain you could teach well while you're doing that you know there are so many people in universities here only <unk> only have masters degrees 
00:17:13	00:17:17	1	well you know i think that there's a big problem in the way that we 
00:17:19	00:17:22	1	you have to get a p._h._d. to teach 
00:17:22	00:17:32	2	university and and i think that a p._h._d. isn't read doesn't really mean that you're a good teacher and in fact of the name of training to be a good teacher but it says that you can do research 
00:17:32	00:17:33	1	yeah 
00:17:33	00:17:36	2	really interested in doing research i'm interested in teaching but in order to 
00:17:36	00:17:37	1	age 
00:17:46	00:17:48	1	oh that'd be fun 
00:17:48	00:17:52	2	looking forward to it really really looking forward to it um 
00:17:52	00:17:54	1	i wish i were taking it 
00:17:54	00:18:00	2	[laughter] you'd be my started pupil no i'd love it 
00:18:00	00:18:02	1	it would be really fun but hopefully it's going to it's going to go 
00:18:02	00:18:14	2	actually last semester i taught introduction arabic linguistics and i had twelve students six of them were grad students <unk> undergrad and it was so hard charlene because i had all these different levels in the class and 
00:18:14	00:18:19	1	people wanted different things from it and it was really amazing 
00:18:19	00:18:20	2	teaching three hours 
00:18:20	00:18:22	1	time once a week 
00:18:22	00:18:24	2	holy cow yeah 
00:18:24	00:18:28	1	so it was it wasn't like enjoyable teaching it was really stressful teaching 
00:18:40	00:18:45	2	yeah well i would be really interested in ah in that course 
00:18:45	00:18:48	1	it was well i can send you the syllabus 
00:18:48	00:18:51	2	if you like yes please do you know 
00:18:51	00:18:59	1	oh who's coming to to michigan in the fall too you know <unk> well i i know his name i i i never met 
00:18:59	00:19:14	2	um he was at um the ohio state university mhm and he is you know what the word i dealings an arabic you mile ideal well that yeah um 
00:19:14	00:19:20	1	it's a good word you should know that some say for example i have a brother 
00:19:27	00:19:28	1	mhm 
00:19:28	00:19:32	2	uh-huh right then the relationship between me and that guy 
00:19:32	00:19:34	1	is ideas 
00:19:34	00:19:46	2	and the significance of it is that if you get it links three unrelated families together oh is that makes sense yeah so professor carris my adviser uh-huh 
00:19:46	00:19:47	1	see i did 
00:19:47	00:19:49	2	uh <unk> <unk> 
00:19:49	00:19:50	1	oh okay 
00:19:50	00:20:05	2	so since professional <unk> retired um and we want to keep up the linguistics stuff at u. of m. <unk> kind of comedy is gonna teach one class each of the two semesters and wear currently in the process of looking for a new arabic 
00:20:05	00:20:06	1	mhm 
00:20:06	00:20:07	2	hello 
00:20:07	00:20:13	1	who are they gonna have they decided on anybody to invite to interview yet

00:20:18	00:20:19	1	uh-huh and it was 
00:20:19	00:20:25	2	really interesting surely not <unk> i i still it was amazing to see this process 
00:20:25	00:20:29	1	um we invited three people and none of them actually one of them that department 
00:20:29	00:20:40	2	really liked but the students were really um very much against her her name was um [noise] bernstein bernstein oh you know what i probably shouldn't be saying well we're being recorded 
00:20:40	00:20:45	1	probably not you can you can email me the name later 
00:20:45	00:20:46	2	[laughter] right 
00:20:46	00:20:53	1	well i think i think that that name is not well and then in any case um so what happened was 
00:20:53	00:20:57	2	there was there was this this the committee 
00:20:57	00:20:59	1	i think i've been in i've talked 
00:20:59	00:21:01	2	yeah 
00:21:01	00:21:04	1	case what ends up happening is that would wear extending the search 
00:21:04	00:21:11	2	uh-huh um and so hopefully i'll still be on it and and essentially what i'm doing a <unk> watching the process you know yeah 
00:21:34	00:21:35	1	wow 
00:21:35	00:21:42	2	i don't know i can't figure it out well so they're looking for somebody to do <unk> 
00:21:42	00:21:54	1	well that's partially it the department is anxious to have somebody who can do all kinds of things and so they really want cultural stuff and they they use so 
00:21:54	00:21:57	2	<unk> what does that mean cultural 
00:21:57	00:22:01	1	well see that's <unk> that's the problem i think that they don't really know what they mean by that 
00:22:01	00:22:05	2	what they want someone who can teach something about arab culture 
00:22:05	00:22:18	1	i mean do they want somebody who can who can when they're teaching an arabic class tell you you know don't show the bottom of your shoes or something or [laughter] hey what did they mean by cultural 
00:22:18	00:22:26	2	i think i i think that that's that's a big problem that they haven't really dealt with and and it's causing great difficulties in this surge 
00:22:26	00:22:27	1	yeah 
00:22:27	00:22:31	2	but um but it's an interesting process to watch 
00:22:31	00:22:33	1	i bet i bet it is 
00:22:52	00:22:54	1	mhm 
00:22:54	00:23:03	2	what i mean our our people in the states who do and boy let me make us in decent sentence [noise] the people in the states who do attic congress 
00:23:03	00:23:05	1	uh-huh 
00:23:05	00:23:10	2	do they work in 
00:23:10	00:23:13	1	arabic discourse analysis at all 
00:23:26	00:23:28	1	um focus on on disk 
00:23:28	00:23:29	2	mhm 
00:23:29	00:23:31	1	and my mood is really into that apparently 
00:23:31	00:23:53	2	yeah well i <unk> he's got an article that that is quite interesting mm me but um [noise] huh because because the guy i'm working with us i mean that he just lives and breathes that really you know i mean that's that's it you know everything else is crap to him 
00:23:53	00:23:55	1	you know 
00:23:59	00:24:07	1	you can't you can't you can't do anything without oriented your brain this way [laughter] 
00:24:07	00:24:08	2	oh and do you like 
00:24:19	00:24:28	2	so many <unk> the results of it impressed me you know as far as translation is concerned 
00:24:28	00:24:29	1	uh i don't i don't know 
00:24:29	00:24:30	2	about 
00:24:32	00:24:39	2	if you're just dealing with out back if you're not if you're not a translator and you are and you are 
00:24:39	00:24:45	1	you can go is not translation huh i'm not sure how interesting 
00:24:45	00:24:50	2	they just wouldn't be the guy that you're working with is interested in it from a translation perspective 
00:24:50	00:24:54	1	yes uh-huh mm yeah 
00:24:54	00:25:03	2	that that seems to make a lot more sense to me actually i find that a lot more appealing than people who do theoretical sorts of discourse analysis 
00:25:03	00:25:05	1	which i find just 
00:25:05	00:25:17	2	too much she you know i can't like at least the phonetics you know i can i can stick some sound through a machine and i can get <unk> readings uh frequency values an apple attitudes and 
00:25:18	00:25:21	2	and so it's something much more 
00:25:21	00:25:22	1	tangible you know 
00:25:22	00:25:25	2	mhm and phonology and even syntax 
00:25:25	00:25:31	1	it's it's much more structured but with people who do discourse stuff i find um 
00:25:31	00:25:37	2	i just can't i don't know it's too messy for me there's nothing to sink my teeth and who you know 
00:25:37	00:25:37	1	mhm 
00:25:41	00:25:54	1	about all of the theory that we've done so far is that most of it deals still on the level of the sentence 
00:25:54	00:25:58	2	mhm mhm and um 
00:26:03	00:26:11	2	you know you get an electric shock if you get stuck on the <unk> the level of the sentence yeah we we have to deal 
00:26:11	00:26:11	1	mhm 
00:26:11	00:26:20	2	always with the tax and beyond the tax in order to produce a decent translation 
00:26:20	00:26:22	1	interesting 
00:26:22	00:26:25	2	and so 
00:26:25	00:26:26	1	mhm 
00:26:26	00:26:41	2	<unk> the discourse analysis theory that i read about in books is you know i mean i look at it and i think who cares what this this yeah you right now right and 
00:26:41	00:26:45	1	and what what there is what little there is 
00:27:05	00:27:07	1	say that was such a relish 
00:27:07	00:27:09	2	well i mean it's 
00:27:09	00:27:12	1	drives me nuts i wish i wish it were all 
00:27:12	00:27:29	2	doubt you know and somebody could tell me what it is i want to know but there isn't anybody to give answers to the questions i have and i so i don't really think of myself as a scholar particularly you know i mean i would rather just be 
00:27:29	00:27:29	1	out there 
00:27:29	00:27:42	2	<unk> later and working as a translator and and when i had a question i would love to be able to ask it and have somebody say oh hi yes blah blah blah blah blah 
00:27:42	00:27:48	1	and instead i find that the questions i'd been wrestling with ever since i started 
00:27:48	00:27:50	2	studying ah pick 
00:27:50	00:27:54	1	finally becoming um [noise] 
00:27:54	00:28:01	2	acknowledge as worthwhile question <unk> and but they're still no answer 
00:28:01	00:28:05	1	oh does it make you want to to look for the answer to them 
00:28:05	00:28:12	2	yes it does but it's very frustrating because i want the answers now [laughter] 
00:28:12	00:28:19	1	well you know actually i think that that's part of what frustrates with what i'm so frustrated with is that it's such a slow process you know where it 
00:28:25	00:28:29	1	but you don't wanna eat <unk> 
00:28:43	00:28:47	1	so are you thinking about doing a p._h._d. 
00:28:47	00:29:00	2	well i am but um you know i if i stick with blonde i want to stick with translation uh-huh and so the best place for me to stick to do that here 
00:29:00	00:29:02	1	[noise] and <unk> is there a p._h._d. program in that 
00:29:02	00:29:06	2	yes uh-huh yeah oh yeah 
00:29:06	00:29:07	1	get funding to do it 
00:29:17	00:29:23	1	don't you know is there anybody there that can sort of advise you on 
00:29:34	00:29:35	1	mhm 
00:29:35	00:29:51	2	the united states is the information society joseph they had a christmas party here for the foreign students and they put up signs everywhere yeah christmas party everybody invited such and such a day 
00:29:53	00:29:56	2	fisher income and they did not put 
00:29:56	00:29:59	1	right on the notice
