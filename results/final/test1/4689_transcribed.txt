00:01:00	00:01:09	2	but every night i read to them they like that and that takes about half an hour and that's probably what i would consider the best time that i have with them 
00:01:09	00:01:13	1	and from what you um what i read and hair that's probably the best 
00:01:13	00:01:15	1	[noise] one of the best things you can do 
00:01:15	00:01:20	2	well they like it you know that's the way we settled them down and get them into bed and uh 
00:01:20	00:01:22	1	and they probably look forward to that every night 
00:01:23	00:01:27	2	i know my children were the same way i mine are quite a bit older 
00:01:27	00:01:28	1	a lot of them [laughter]

00:01:34	00:01:36	1	and the little 
00:01:36	00:01:42	2	which my two youngest they really like to spend that time just before i had seen red woman

00:01:44	00:01:46	1	personal time with 
00:01:46	00:01:49	2	yeah nobody else interfering 
00:01:49	00:01:54	2	yeah when you had a large family got kind of hard for the individual time with each child 
00:01:56	00:01:57	1	it's um 
00:01:57	00:01:58	1	mhm 
00:01:58	00:01:59	1	it's something 
00:01:59	00:02:01	2	when i was young 
00:02:08	00:02:09	1	and um 
00:02:09	00:02:11	2	mhm mhm 
00:02:18	00:02:20	1	yeah right right 
00:02:20	00:02:38	2	she likes it and and she knows that it's important uh in fact my four year old is is now reading along with us so and and that's because you know we've been able to spend the time and and she has found that it's enjoyable so now we kind of trade off i read to her and she reads to me 
00:02:38	00:02:39	1	mhm 
00:02:39	00:02:43	1	what'd you same story long enough they even can memorize it 
00:02:43	00:02:49	2	well actually that she she can pick up a book now that's brand new and and ah and pick out the word read along 
00:02:49	00:02:50	1	that's that's 
00:02:50	00:02:53	2	she's ah pretty remarkable that way 
00:02:53	00:02:57	1	for a four year old a lot of children 
00:02:57	00:03:00	2	but uh our our two year old 
00:03:05	00:03:08	2	'cause that's the books that she likes she likes the list of things 
00:03:08	00:03:09	1	mhm 
00:03:09	00:03:10	1	but 
00:03:10	00:03:11	2	yeah 
00:03:11	00:03:13	1	other than that 
00:03:17	00:03:19	1	oh you know dinnertime 
00:03:19	00:03:23	2	and uh i'll sometimes come back to work and then go back to their bed time 
00:03:23	00:03:25	1	and then usually i 
00:03:27	00:03:28	1	um 
00:03:29	00:03:30	1	[noise] so 
00:03:31	00:03:32	2	i i think they're nuts 
00:03:32	00:03:33	1	too badly 
00:03:33	00:03:34	1	mhm 
00:03:34	00:03:36	2	well i always felt like it 
00:03:36	00:03:38	1	mhm mhm 
00:03:38	00:03:39	1	mhm 
00:03:39	00:03:39	2	mhm 
00:03:40	00:03:41	1	yeah 
00:03:41	00:03:44	2	parents can go in winning whim university 
00:03:45	00:03:46	1	can and 
00:03:46	00:03:49	2	have some good quality time with them and it's still 
00:03:49	00:03:52	1	it's still okay it's the children that come home 
00:03:52	00:03:53	2	to houses that worry me 
00:03:54	00:04:00	2	yeah 'cause then you know they're not getting any instruction except from the t._v. [laughter] that's right which is not the place to get 
00:04:00	00:04:01	1	and you wonder 
00:04:04	00:04:07	2	school and if i wasn't here 
00:04:07	00:04:08	1	i would miss out on 
00:04:08	00:04:10	2	so many important 
00:04:10	00:04:12	1	things that i hear when they when they 
00:04:12	00:04:13	2	mhm 
00:04:20	00:04:22	2	several households where the children come home and 
00:04:22	00:04:23	1	there's no one there 
00:04:24	00:04:26	2	and they just all kinds of pack out together 
00:04:26	00:04:28	1	and around the neighborhood 
00:04:29	00:04:30	1	and tell the parents 
00:04:34	00:04:38	1	really really glad that that's not what happens at my house because uh 
00:04:38	00:04:43	1	i kinda think that's where the the problems are coming from 
00:04:43	00:04:50	2	to them especially in in like the cities where there are lots and lots of kids and i'm on some pressure to go out and work 
00:04:51	00:04:52	1	it does 
00:04:52	00:04:53	2	mhm 
00:04:57	00:04:58	1	what they use their going 
00:04:58	00:04:59	2	mhm
