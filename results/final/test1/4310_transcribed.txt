00:02:49	00:03:09	2	he works for someone i know in town here and he um if you're going to be like legal hassle i don't think so um there was a car parked on the curve and he had swung around out around to pass to get car and obviously i mean he was on her side of the road okay he obviously was going faster than you should have been ready to stop i just seen er yeah but um 
00:03:09	00:03:16	1	[noise] you know i guess i don't where they call them accidents i don't know i <unk> they both had insurance and you know at least 
00:03:19	00:03:24	1	but so that was my relaxing i thought oh god i wish i were back in philadelphia with the heat 
00:03:24	00:03:40	2	and the noise and the trolley car at all the rest of it would be your trolley car at night it's funny until you get used to it you know we weren't kind of like it yeah well we're not suppose i suppose we shouldn't talk about people we know but they've been married were fantastic yeah oh you can say that that i can say 
00:03:40	00:03:42	1	they were the most gracious 
00:03:42	00:03:45	2	uh i can't imagine how anybody could be more 
00:03:45	00:03:47	1	it's a bit of old gracious and welcome 
00:03:47	00:03:49	2	and they were they acted like it was absolutely nothing to er 
00:03:49	00:03:50	1	with your new 
00:03:50	00:03:54	2	baby in states where they're basing that way you know they just absolutely 
00:03:54	00:03:56	1	totally gracious about it 
00:03:56	00:04:03	2	[noise] so that was wonderful and i didn't realize how relaxing it was until i got home and it's to the contrary so she's really 
00:04:03	00:04:04	1	going to be all right though 
00:04:04	00:04:09	2	she's very very sore 'cause like all her muscles <unk> but she was in a relationship it or 
00:04:09	00:04:11	1	back to her um health club 
00:04:11	00:04:25	2	ah i know at the moment she's not sort of going anywhere but she had a doctor's appointment on wednesday to go get checked out again they x. rayed her and everything is not broke and she was wearing too seatbelts you know the lap and the shoulder belt italy and yeah she's okay it's really amazing 
00:04:38	00:04:40	1	they've already been down there 
00:04:40	00:04:44	2	they came down on saturday oh my god and um <unk> already seen the baby 
00:04:44	00:04:47	1	yeah they came saturday actually they 
00:04:47	00:04:48	2	let me grass for wonder this 
00:04:48	00:04:55	1	um well it's funny i didn't know if they weren't going to come so fast dad said i said well when did you think you might want to come this is when i called them from philly 
00:04:55	00:05:01	2	yeah that's it will allow us about five hours uh-huh which is exactly how long it takes to dry [laughter] 
00:05:01	00:05:02	1	and um 
00:05:02	00:05:12	2	[laughter] mom said well you know we could go in wait we could go what we could go to your house in wait until we got 
00:05:21	00:05:23	1	actually they made some fun 
00:05:33	00:05:39	1	they might have waited if i had let them but i don't think dad wanted to mom lives they get overwhelmed about having to go 
00:05:39	00:05:42	2	too many places are saying um 
00:05:42	00:05:46	1	so they came and that was nice they seem very very happy oh that's oh 
00:05:58	00:06:00	1	uh-huh you know 
00:06:00	00:06:04	2	yeah you'd think they'd come to really help and they're willing to be helpful to hold the baby 
00:06:04	00:06:06	1	yeah um 
00:06:06	00:06:17	2	but i was surprised at how much you know could i have a glass of juice and let's have breakfast and you know yeah <unk> and which it's double the dishes and stuff i was a little surprised but i think it's that their formal robert 
00:06:17	00:06:22	1	that it is it's that they're scared to make themselves at home it's like the opposite of david in mary 
00:06:31	00:06:32	1	mhm 
00:06:32	00:06:37	2	yeah you know and that he's right they are sort of formal and you don't just go into somebody else's house and we'll be meals 
00:06:37	00:06:41	1	on on their good behavior and they have this whole idea of not 
00:06:41	00:06:47	2	taking over mom has a <unk> well they do i would have been happier she'd have taken over the <unk> 
00:06:47	00:06:50	1	if you said to her i we should just take over too 
00:06:50	00:06:52	2	that's true that's true 
00:06:52	00:06:54	1	so 'cause i've had moments 
00:06:54	00:07:07	2	and i suddenly realized she was dying to scrub my stove and i just said all right oh [laughter] see i've never never acted that impulse when she's visited me i wish i would [laughter] those needs scrubbing in a big way but i don't think 
00:07:07	00:07:18	1	the dares in your place frankly i don't know why well your place is very very special it's so much yours it's also very very dirty so maybe the other thing she may feel that if she started she wouldn't know where to stop 
00:07:18	00:07:20	2	right 
00:07:20	00:07:21	1	i'm just guessing 
00:07:21	00:07:25	2	anyway oh well so they didn't <unk> but they stayed in a hotel 
00:07:25	00:07:27	1	uh-huh and and the way that was 
00:07:27	00:07:42	2	as well uh-huh but they really liked me uh-huh very very sweet we should have some pictures soon building thing nobody could have been adjustment i go in february and i come back and my parents or grandparents it's sort of uh trying to absorb that 
00:07:42	00:07:48	1	yeah it's funny well you'll see in the pictures they look very well suited i'm sure they will that sort of what scares me about 
00:07:48	00:07:51	2	i think they've been actually waiting when that when the pressure on any of us 
00:07:51	00:07:56	1	oh i know they have yeah mom has told me oh she's told me 
00:07:56	00:08:07	2	oh they haven't said act around the time you got married she knew she was ready oh yeah well i know she's been she had a surprising inventory in her head of what was available in gee we'll occurs 
00:08:07	00:08:11	1	she and i both can't stay out of here ever since joseph was born uh-huh 
00:08:11	00:08:16	2	whenever i come up there i took some pictures with you in mind of jokes of holding me

00:08:19	00:08:26	2	i can't wait to see the golden boys get silly when you try and take their picture i know they make the news and stuff 
00:08:26	00:08:31	1	beautiful photogenic until the age of about three and it was all over at that point he started <unk> 
00:08:31	00:08:33	2	yeah well i don't know 
00:08:43	00:08:45	1	self conscious sure but um

00:11:06	00:11:07	1	oh maybe 
00:11:12	00:11:14	1	they it seems strange

00:11:23	00:11:26	1	something i think he was sending to which was this 
00:11:26	00:11:30	2	ticket from he's got the fish and we had gone to 
00:11:30	00:11:35	1	that's right where we are too uh-huh that was in there too right and breathing is to me 
00:11:35	00:11:46	2	right and i like that you said you only mentioned you know it was something about the what about the baby you know once every forty minutes by keeping very busy oh that we can [laughter] yeah it was great but it was supposed to <unk> 
00:11:46	00:11:52	1	[laughter] so tell me a little bit about the day she was born when did you first 
00:11:52	00:12:07	2	her um what happened is we went to the hospital she was induced mhm so we get a phone call and it was she was supposed to um the birth mom was supposed to go in at um it's a nice thinking that this will be distributed publicly right at um six thirty in the morning but she called in 
00:12:07	00:12:13	1	didn't have any beds oh no so she called us and told us that but then they did get a bed and she went in to date 
00:12:13	00:12:14	2	mhm 
00:12:14	00:12:20	1	or seven thirty or i guess you went in at seven thirty and they started or it eight or so so we hopped in the car and drove down to 
00:12:20	00:12:21	2	mhm for the day 
00:12:21	00:12:22	1	uh-huh 
00:12:22	00:12:25	2	and um we hung out all day we had it 
00:12:25	00:12:29	1	we had some difficult times of the lawyer down there he was supposed to show 
00:12:41	00:12:53	2	but then five twenty five may was born right and the person with his mother was with her through the whole thing and she was fantastic she was just great she was so nice to us and so solid there for her daughter and just a wonderful 
00:12:53	00:12:54	1	woman 
00:13:00	00:13:02	1	progress reports of housing 
00:13:02	00:13:09	2	going and actually it was very funny because the first time she came out i mean here we're out there sort of ringing our hands and 
00:13:09	00:13:10	1	uh-huh 
00:13:10	00:13:18	2	out and wondering how everybody's going and everything and she came out and could i go downstairs because um her daughter wanted playing cards uh-huh so i guess she was 
00:13:18	00:13:20	1	uh-huh [laughter] 
00:13:20	00:13:35	2	[laughter] so we went downstairs and get playing cards with her and uh-huh and then later on she came out and she wanted some chewing gum [laughter] um i guess your mouse gets dry and yet i want something so you know it was it was kinda funny these reassuring in a way i would think 
00:13:35	00:13:39	1	but he's very um you know there's such sort of specific 
00:13:39	00:13:42	2	yeah and um 
00:13:42	00:13:47	1	but they kind of held her back i think the baby was born in born sooner but the doctor didn't get there till around three 
00:13:47	00:13:51	2	so i thought once it was induced there was like no stopping it 
00:13:51	00:13:55	1	no they can hold you back a little bit you know once it depends how much stuff 
00:13:55	00:13:56	2	they give you 
00:14:00	00:14:05	2	uh-huh um and the doctor showed up around three and may was born at five twenty five 
00:14:05	00:14:06	1	mhm 
00:14:06	00:14:15	2	owns eight ounces mhm and screaming mhm really screaming and i was a little scared i thought oh my god what have we brought you could hear her out through the door 
00:14:15	00:14:17	1	paul uh-huh 
00:14:17	00:14:18	2	a lot of babies being born you didn't hear 
00:14:18	00:14:23	1	all uh-huh and um what happened i guess um 
00:14:23	00:14:27	2	that's right your mom came running out to tell us the baby was born and then she said that 
00:14:27	00:14:29	1	[laughter] 
00:14:29	00:14:37	2	and um [noise] said it was a beautiful birth i mean to push isn't she was out which is really great so she's very an squashed in on battered looking 
00:14:37	00:14:39	1	right but usually they look at it back 
00:14:39	00:14:45	2	but she's got a nice shaped head and you know she doesn't look like she was um if she's not a <unk> 
00:14:45	00:14:47	1	but did you get to see you're in a few hours 
00:14:47	00:15:01	2	well what happened right away they there was a very nice um delivery nurse who we had spoken to earlier in the day named tina and what they do is they take the baby from the delivery room to the nursery <unk> normally they go directly in teen a very very sweet 
00:15:01	00:15:04	1	[noise] <unk> pass the door to the out 
00:15:04	00:15:15	2	out are part of the nursery where we were waiting and let us holder mhm she was just minutes old then wow so we told her for just a couple of minutes and uh-huh it was really funny because you can hear her coming up the <unk> 
00:15:15	00:15:16	1	<unk> <unk> 
00:15:16	00:15:20	2	you had it or to me screaming loudly and i said to tina and also 
00:15:43	00:15:46	2	very wonderful for auburn for me to just to see i know 
00:15:46	00:15:49	1	would work too yeah i don't know what it is he has some you have in every body 
00:15:49	00:16:00	2	warmth or something but i think it's partly it but there are certain kinds of men who <unk> i think it's men who have like these big i have this theory that it's men who are very broad right under the elbow 
00:16:07	00:16:10	2	who have like these big broad forearms 
00:16:10	00:16:11	1	[laughter] 
00:16:11	00:16:21	2	i think the lady that it gives security i took three remember auto who moved my filing cabinet that time of philadelphia he's another one uh-huh he's big he's sort of solid 
00:16:21	00:16:28	1	very solid and they but robert's not look like that nobody but robert is big below yelled those i'll bet if you 
00:16:28	00:16:41	2	i have to check out the loan [laughter] at any rate um so that was nice and then we watch through the nursery while they do if you survive the first four hours of life in the nursery you'll survive anything after 
00:16:41	00:16:42	1	most 
00:16:42	00:16:49	2	sort of appalling introduction to life uh-huh but i was kinda scared at that point 'cause we're looking and and they're all these nice sweet little <unk> baby 
00:16:49	00:16:50	1	lying there living huh 
00:16:50	00:17:00	2	and there's may and she's big compared to the rest and she was bright red is screaming and she screamed and she screamed and she screamed and all the rest of them as soon as they 
00:17:00	00:17:01	1	they sort of get exhausted 
00:17:01	00:17:03	2	two two screens and <unk> 
00:17:03	00:17:12	1	and she was healthy i guess uh-huh and scream didn't screen and screamed and screamed and screamed and i thought oh my god what have we brought here 
00:17:12	00:17:14	2	[laughter] i know you've heard off the car 
00:17:14	00:17:17	1	really they tell us anything in fact at the hospital they weren't 
00:17:17	00:17:26	2	<unk> there were <unk> the individual people we had contact with were were decent to us in friendly but um the hospital policy was rather an friendly to us 
00:17:26	00:17:29	1	like we had been told we they have a room called the bonding room 
00:17:29	00:17:38	2	uh-huh and whole purpose of the room it to let people being it with a baby who are going to be with the baby right and they wouldn't let us in there so it was really quite often 
00:17:38	00:17:39	1	well they wouldn't let us they didn't they 
00:17:39	00:17:42	2	they gave us they didn't tell us beans yeah i mean they really didn't 
00:17:53	00:17:56	1	guess they have their rules are just very rigid 
00:17:56	00:17:57	2	mhm and 
00:17:57	00:17:59	1	problem is a lawyer was supposed to 
00:17:59	00:18:09	2	arranged for um right an additional bracelet mhm another words what happens if they put one on the wrist of the baby one on the ankle one on the birth mother and then she has a what 
00:18:09	00:18:13	1	call the fourth bracelet which she can give to whoever will be her coach through that 
00:18:13	00:18:15	2	birth and stuff and of course had given it to her mother 
00:18:15	00:18:17	1	which makes perfect sense mhm 
00:18:17	00:18:20	2	well the only way they couldn't get their minds 
00:18:20	00:18:22	1	the notion of a fifth bracelet for right 
00:18:22	00:18:28	2	so the only way that they would have let us in there was to take her mother's away right which we wouldn't be asking which drains you wouldn't do 
00:18:44	00:18:47	1	legal things but yeah um you know in terms of the things 
00:18:47	00:18:55	2	he's a s._o._b. forgive me tape whoever you are but uh soccer and um i mean i'm sorry but he was 
00:18:58	00:19:03	1	[laughter] anyway it's english so yeah it's american english um [noise] you know 
00:19:03	00:19:15	2	he said things to me like you'll have or for the rest of your life you know yeah don't worry about it which is really an arrogant attitude to take you know and [laughter] yeah he was really he was a real arrogant
