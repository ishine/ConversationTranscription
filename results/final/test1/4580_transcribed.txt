00:02:03	00:02:20	2	no more than anybody else you know yeah we had dinner at each other's houses for years <unk> you know every night and you know we'd have a beer before dinner and then uh bottom line uh-huh that was it wasn't like he had any more than anybody else 
00:02:20	00:02:23	1	yeah well obviously he did when nobody was around 
00:02:23	00:02:25	2	well yeah yeah 
00:02:25	00:02:27	1	because that's 
00:02:27	00:02:28	2	[noise] 
00:02:38	00:02:50	2	right i mean you know he'd have a beer maybe that could be years before dinner you know what a bottle maybe it's two modeled blind but nothing yeah you know it wasn't like he sat and drank right whole bottle right 
00:02:50	00:02:54	1	well <unk> know that he was

00:03:08	00:03:10	1	they have to be willing to do it i mean 
00:03:10	00:03:17	2	no um [noise] there's nothing that it's like someone smoking 
00:03:17	00:03:19	1	or any other addiction 
00:03:25	00:03:53	2	i mean it wasn't like we ever showed up at their house or they should have at our house and he was he wasn't right he acted normally always act that normal when he <unk> no it was like he was falling over right you know like my friend jimmy it was <unk> yeah he couldn't handle it was like a you know and it was obvious right from the beginning and he you know he like tennessee or is it a shot [noise] 
00:03:53	00:03:57	1	well there are some alcoholics or able to conceal it better than others who 
00:03:57	00:04:00	2	you know takes more to affect them 
00:04:00	00:04:03	1	so that it's obvious to others 
00:04:03	00:04:22	2	mm well explains a lot of the <unk> that you know like came would say that he he took a lot of base mhm and i don't know you know it's like i can't understand why she never told me all this time 
00:04:22	00:04:28	1	that's uh that's something is very hard to share with any money and it's kind of thing really 
00:04:28	00:04:50	2	we're such close friends but i mean you know up until two months ago we're still going over each other we just didn't do it much this summer mhm but you know we'd go there for me to open a bottle of wine mhm you know why continue if they're going alcoholics anonymous for five years yeah why do that with close friends 
00:04:50	00:04:52	1	right and don't surf i sure 
00:04:52	00:05:02	2	don't <unk> or say you know i'm not we would have sort of gotten the cool mhm after a while when they didn't want to drink any one in our house or 
00:05:02	00:05:03	1	mhm 
00:05:13	00:05:26	1	you know you know to enjoy humphries became an alcoholic and that lesson that comes our house as they walked in she walked in first and <unk> stop me at the door i said uh don't serve any <unk> and liquor 
00:05:26	00:05:30	2	you don't even know yeah you know yeah i mean where 
00:05:30	00:05:37	1	friendly with jimmy and we don't drink around him right you know we don't have anything he doesn't have anything mhm 
00:05:37	00:05:38	2	mhm 
00:05:38	00:05:41	1	wild tempt them you know we're not gonna sit here and have a beer in front of 'em they can't 
00:05:41	00:05:44	2	right right and why wouldn't they 
00:05:44	00:05:47	1	tell us to try to help them with this 
00:05:47	00:06:07	2	you know yeah who knows i don't know that they're i guess they probably felt it was a terrible shame a disgrace maybe it was just but that's foolish because you certainly should share these things with your friends so that they can help you with it rather than 
00:06:07	00:06:14	1	continue to use it an abuse it you know i'm sorry to hear that 
00:06:14	00:06:17	2	i help certainly hope he'll make it 
00:06:17	00:06:22	1	but she said you know like he used to take these all the time mhm he's been doing this 
00:06:22	00:06:25	2	forever yeah and um 
00:06:25	00:06:31	1	she said oh he seems to catch everything the kids get mhm i mean whether she didn't realize that he was 
00:06:31	00:06:32	2	mhm 
00:06:32	00:06:35	1	yeah you know right 
00:06:35	00:06:40	2	right you just deny it to yourself too yeah i mean i was up there last week with her [noise] 
00:06:40	00:06:42	1	sure mhm 
00:06:42	00:06:48	2	and she said you know what i've been counting up the number of sick days again he's taken since the beginning of the year he's taken twelve <unk> 
00:06:48	00:06:48	1	mhm 
00:06:48	00:06:53	2	and he always took days when she was working in the kids were at daycare 
00:06:53	00:06:55	1	mhm 
00:06:55	00:06:59	2	and i you know i'm thinking to myself gee he must really need 
00:06:59	00:07:00	1	a break 
00:07:00	00:07:02	2	yeah you know maybe he just 
00:07:02	00:07:10	1	how strong soften can't tolerate mhm you know having to go to work and always have people around having to be home and always have <unk> you know maybe 
00:07:10	00:07:12	2	need the days mhm 
00:07:12	00:07:23	1	to themselves maybe this is just too much you know three kids is too much for him or something i'm thinking it's family stress i didn't think it was mhm because he was <unk> 
00:07:23	00:07:46	2	uh right whatever yeah that's it's not that kind of thing that pops into <unk> into your mind is as being a fairly common although i'm sure it's much more common to what we all know mhm but it isn't the first thing that you think about when you hear about someone taking six days you think they're set mm 
00:07:46	00:07:51	1	oh like here's this complain any 'til nine o'clock at night and i can i say 
00:07:51	00:08:14	2	you know mhm what's going on that he can't match his walk alone mhm you know if he's there from not help anyone work from nine in the morning until mine at night five days a week yeah i get home at ten o'clock where like you know right obviously can't marriages were closer mhm you know we just couldn't understand it yeah but he was probably going 
00:08:16	00:08:18	2	so maybe she didn't know 
00:08:18	00:08:21	1	mhm no right 
00:08:21	00:08:25	2	she knew enough to know it was an alcoholic and to have him get help 
00:08:25	00:08:26	1	mhm 
00:08:26	00:08:32	2	and to go out and she said you know lately it's gotten so bad that he was seeing one on one or 
00:08:32	00:08:36	1	mhm mhm 
00:08:36	00:08:46	2	oh i guess they said minutes forty eight hours a credible damn shame hoping he makes sure sure 
00:08:46	00:08:48	1	see around your age 
00:08:48	00:09:24	2	'cause he over thirty nine mm [noise] yeah it's really rough yeah sorry to hear like mickey mantle one's great mm yeah yeah no it's no good at any age or what you know some people catches up with it earlier i suppose anyway how was your <unk> okay yeah yesterday afternoon that's one of the kids were sleeping when we went by twelve oh [laughter] oh [laughter] we ended up actually a really good place um
