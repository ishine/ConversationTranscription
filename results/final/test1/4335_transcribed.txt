00:05:11	00:05:14	2	lunch and that um atrium type deal they have there and 
00:05:28	00:05:29	1	huh 
00:05:29	00:05:35	2	interesting stuff oh really hot and just a little bit yeah she told you that are not about how they had an opera in their house and stuff 
00:05:35	00:05:39	1	yeah she did tell me they had an offer because i called her to talk to her about that 
00:05:39	00:05:48	2	yeah the plane ticket yeah and um [noise] i said well what are they asking for the house and she didn't know she was new to to offer was thirty thousand dollars below it 
00:05:48	00:05:58	1	told me they were asking to sixty oh really yeah and he's or two fifty nine i i can't remember what he said he said they had it like at two sixty 
00:05:58	00:06:04	2	and then agents that they should put it like two fifty nine nine or something so that 
00:06:04	00:06:07	1	because some people you know and i thought 
00:06:07	00:06:13	2	they should probably put it back to be below two fifty would be a normal cut off place for a lot more people oh yeah 
00:06:13	00:06:16	1	and well but the thing about that some people 
00:06:16	00:06:33	2	look a little higher than that and an offer to fifty right you know um god that is so noisy i hate it when the girls do that when i'm on the phone and they have ice maker oh for me it just sounds like i can't hear thing when that's on um what did they pay for the house 
00:06:37	00:06:40	2	and then they put it in the pool yeah 
00:06:52	00:06:57	1	when you look at what happened yeah his house and they can take that loss on their taxes 
00:06:57	00:07:00	2	yeah you know i mean you can recoup out a little bit 
00:07:00	00:07:05	1	<unk> i don't know what the pool costs that it probably be about two thirty yet would be lost 
00:07:05	00:07:09	2	yeah they would take a log on it but you could like i said you can write that off too 
00:07:09	00:07:12	1	[noise] on your taxes and um because 
00:07:12	00:07:18	2	so when it's when you'd think we'd be wanting to get rid of that 'cause she's probably out of hand <unk> least i'd gets to live 
00:07:18	00:07:21	1	so i know well i know when um 
00:07:21	00:07:33	2	mitch sold his stocks to get the money and build their house he had to sell it at a loss and we've taken that loss on the tax return i think next year last year we get to take it and he said that it really hurt us when we go 
00:07:33	00:07:34	1	any more yeah 
00:07:37	00:07:38	1	or is it raining out 
00:07:38	00:07:53	2	yeah yeah you can stretch it out and that will be gone but you know that's kind of a nice less especially if he's going to be a single person yeah and he said that he said they didn't want 'em in filed for divorce and then that wasn't an issue the main thing was selling the house first and 
00:08:02	00:08:06	1	and a lotta bands you know and <unk> and she's so funny 
00:08:06	00:08:09	2	you write something about she thought she was in was that 
00:08:09	00:08:13	1	man and the relationship and then she said i don't know much about this can both and meet men 
00:08:13	00:08:21	2	[laughter] which is kind of funny see well susan definitely lost 
00:08:21	00:08:23	1	man yeah yeah so it but then 
00:08:32	00:08:51	2	that is just so bizarre yeah it really like i said i think the red flags were there all along and we chose to ignore them yeah because we wanted happiness for taught oh yeah oh yeah that was my very first thought that oh don't be so mean don't even say that yeah yeah i looked out that window and they were in the back yard and it took me a minute to this 
00:08:51	00:08:55	1	side which one was hot yeah mhm mhm yeah 
00:08:55	00:09:06	2	well and i'll never forget that night when they were right before the wedding when she said when she mentioned that girl friends and how you know she thought you know this girlfriend at work so they can be friends anymore and she told her that was so 
00:09:06	00:09:08	1	i thought why she told me about a girl friend 
00:09:08	00:09:12	2	yeah yeah i remember then <unk> you know i mean yeah 
00:09:12	00:09:16	1	little bells went off in my head but i just thought no no no no you know 
00:09:16	00:09:28	2	there's a lady in our office who was married and got divorced and her last kids just graduating from high school and she was talking about that she was going to sell her house and get a small place and she wanted to be out in the country and blah blah blah yeah 
00:09:28	00:09:31	1	and um i had seen her 
00:09:31	00:09:42	2	so go at a restaurant with a lady and you know and they asked him guilty when you saw them you know things yeah and it was this saturday night you know but it was kinda like she and it was a small restaurant that i um 
00:09:42	00:09:47	1	other people picked it but it was like way out of the way and not a place i've ever been before ever heard of and right 
00:09:47	00:09:56	2	and there she was and so she kinda it was it was just a little different than it and are you know and i thought that is kind of strange and then i thought they they kind of looked like they were 
00:10:09	00:10:11	1	oh [laughter] 
00:10:11	00:10:21	2	and i told her about see her in the restaurant and how they act to kind of weird stuff and she said why we've kinda wondered about her she is a real man hater she just oh rowing figured that was because she went through a bad divorce yeah really did 
00:10:21	00:10:26	1	he ran around i had another woman in yeah kind of a bad deal for her so 
00:10:26	00:10:33	2	but anyways you know it just all makes sense yeah like you said the little signals we're kind of there but you just to go that's you know yeah 
00:10:33	00:10:34	1	don't jump to conclusions 
00:10:34	00:10:52	2	you know he's <unk> he's out with another woman you know that doesn't mean she's a lesbian or anything and then i really thought even if they live together i suppose they don't necessarily have to have a sexual relationship you know that i've thought of doing that before and i i still think if something happened to <unk> you know later on and they had a woman friend that i enjoyed and stuff 
00:10:52	00:10:53	1	i wouldn't you know it 
00:10:53	00:11:01	2	yeah you opposed to very allies together or something to share with an habit a companion and stuff and it wouldn't mean we were sleeping together but 
00:11:01	00:11:04	1	um [noise] each to their own <unk> 
00:11:04	00:11:08	2	and it's just too bad taught had to be caught and <unk> and i say get 
00:11:18	00:11:19	1	find somebody else 
00:11:19	00:11:28	2	which you know i think that would be better you know oh yeah and and then quit going over to see her parents and stuff i think that's just kind of prolonging it 
00:11:28	00:11:30	1	so but uh 
00:11:30	00:11:42	2	that you do it too you know right you have to edit go gradually i yeah when when that when that's not right for him anymore right yeah for my own brother but 
00:11:55	00:11:57	1	[laughter]

00:13:55	00:14:06	2	mhm he said a v._a. lie who's planning to leave and open a private practice said he did worst for nothing but the only thing the court is concerned with is how the properties divided and since i will be very simple and no children involved

00:15:49	00:15:57	2	yeah it's kind of the same attitude you know well i didn't like that volunteering so i'll never do it again yeah yeah and we're thinking that you know out that was 
00:15:57	00:16:01	1	maybe not what i wanted but there could be something else there you know she her mind is just so close to every 
00:16:10	00:16:11	1	i mean i wasn't 
00:16:11	00:16:15	2	really looking forward to that either but she wanted to do it and it would be okay 
00:16:15	00:16:18	1	and better i mean for like two days before hand 'cause i'm just reading this

00:19:59	00:20:11	2	the thing about this neighborhood it is like a little small town yeah and uh and i'll always know these people as long as i live here and i'll always have contact with him but she says like isolated from the world oh yeah she's just really 
00:20:11	00:20:12	1	yeah and i just 
00:20:21	00:20:30	2	yeah his health is worse i think i think it is you know that arthritic hunting and everything i love to be a hundred to you if you're just sit there and get <unk> 
00:20:30	00:20:34	1	i don't know see i just i'm worried about her because she just doesn't have any 
00:20:36	00:20:38	1	i guess to keep your 
00:20:38	00:20:48	2	interest i don't think i think she'll just be you know like her hurdle to stop kind of what should be a nice way to go but it'll just be more from you know that 
00:20:48	00:20:52	1	losing the will to live kind of you know not really wanting to die but just not really have anything to live for 
00:20:52	00:20:58	2	well you know she always says that thing about feeling needed and i almost feel guilty that i didn't need her this summer too 
00:20:58	00:21:01	1	you know we don't you know they're you know 
00:21:01	00:21:06	2	but i still would you know she wants to like i figure next summer i won't have any classes 
00:21:22	00:21:24	1	i liked 
00:21:24	00:21:24	2	from new york 
00:21:24	00:21:27	1	yeah and i don't know she probably wouldn't really like to work in 
00:21:27	00:21:42	2	did some of that too i was so you know the days that i was off i would go run and then i wanted to spend and sometimes she would kind of come outside and smoke a cigarette and <unk> yeah she could have just come out and you know cause i planted flowers and did some of that stuff when she was here 
00:21:42	00:21:44	1	yeah you know 
00:21:44	00:21:45	2	but she didn't really 
00:21:45	00:21:47	1	i mean i enjoy that 
00:21:47	00:22:03	2	after he comes home we eat dinner and clean up and then we usually go out in the yard 'cause it's cool then yeah and we usually walk around and and you know what's the place that needs to be waited so we'll stop and pull the weeds and talk you know and then we'll walk you you know we we've peruse the entire perimeter easy [laughter] and then we'll check the tomato 
00:22:03	00:22:09	1	i was in like a couple of nights ago we put miracle grow on the flowers and it's just a nice you know what i'm saying yeah it's cool 
00:22:09	00:22:19	2	it's pretty outside and the stuff needs to be done your age and then and then we usually end up getting a popsicle or something and we sit on the front porch swing for a while and it's just so pleasant and nice outside to me it's just a real plus 
00:22:19	00:22:27	1	that way yeah to spend the evening and you get and you get a little bit of everything done around the yard so it doesn't become completely overgrown with weights and stuff 
00:22:27	00:22:34	2	and you know i mean i would be perfectly willing just to do stuff like that with my mother just to do things around and talk and 
00:22:34	00:22:41	1	you know enjoy each other's company while we're doing that but it's like you said you give her project and then she's like well i can't do that 
00:22:41	00:22:53	2	[laughter] it sounds weird [laughter] it was just doing my windows i kinda started before i called you and and um she did like those four big ones you know in the union area there and that was 
00:22:53	00:22:54	1	just lazy i just 
00:22:54	00:23:05	2	didn't want to do any more and it's like okay but i mean i already did those <unk> five minutes and you know literally to do i mean that was it you know that we saw that she had the energy 
00:23:05	00:23:15	1	you got to <unk> around here now that i'm done with school i've got this i thought about your products are i think at this place is such a pet i mean that basement i'm afraid to even look at it 
00:23:15	00:23:27	2	yeah that's pretty well straightened up and i say there's more of ted's crap and i didn't think he had much stuff and i see the thing that so annoying it's like he had all this crap on the shelf and his master bedroom in the apartment 
00:23:27	00:23:28	1	yeah they have like the oldest 
00:23:28	00:23:36	2	tiny portable black and white t._v. and stuff when would you ever use that oh well so you mentioned the same way he got stuff from centuries 
00:23:36	00:23:46	1	and it's kinda like if it's something expensive or if it was expensive uh-huh it he doesn't want to throw it away right and then <unk> <unk> it's it's like a letter golf bag but it's gotta be twenty or thirty years old and 
00:23:46	00:23:50	2	uh you know what i mean it <unk> it is leather uh-huh i'm sure it was 
00:23:50	00:23:53	1	expensive and so it was out in the garage and so 
00:23:53	00:23:55	2	he'd set it up there and 
00:24:06	00:24:07	1	<unk> no 
00:24:07	00:24:19	2	i know that that's why you set it up there isn't gonna put my class i said you are and it's real heavy and stuff yeah never walk anymore is right in the car and he said that's a really expensive golf bag and i said but it's old and it's all be 
00:24:19	00:24:21	1	no i'm going to use it jumped right away i said okay 
00:24:21	00:24:28	2	well of course it sat there oh yeah the whole time so i finally just moved it down into the basement you know but <unk> why would you keep that i mean because you 
00:24:28	00:24:31	1	can't stand <unk> paid i don't know whether 
00:24:31	00:24:37	2	probably a couple of hundred dollars round way back when or something you know and it's just like it looks like shit i would be embarrassed 
00:24:37	00:24:41	1	use that money would ever noticed that it's real weather or they don't 
00:24:41	00:24:47	2	a lot of money it just looks like an <unk> put that 
00:24:47	00:24:56	1	down in the basement i moved it up yeah and then that box that t._v. and all that shit and he's never ever open that are looking at that stuff and you know and 
00:24:56	00:25:10	2	stuff down there that when they when his aunt died and they cleaned it all out and he just moved at all but he has never gone through it that's what half of that stuff is and and see i can understand it said like they're just says a lot for the <unk> right i can understand there may be 
00:25:10	00:25:12	1	things of hers in there 
00:25:12	00:25:22	2	<unk> yeah but my lord i mean she's been dead for almost ten years yeah you know let's go through it and figure well the neighborhood is having a garage sale september <unk> 
00:25:22	00:25:23	1	be maybe 
00:25:23	00:25:40	2	motivate me through all this stuff and then i thought and maybe it would make some money for christmas too because i'm thrilled that they're eliminating that in service but it was like a check for three hundred and fifty dollars that if it was a separate check yeah it's not a contract that's why they could eliminate it and um 
00:25:41	00:25:43	2	and i always you know that helps 
00:25:43	00:25:44	1	christmas 
00:25:44	00:25:56	2	yeah and things are going to be tight anyway so i thought well maybe if i got 'cause i could sell shelley's old furniture you know there's some big things in there right so we could get rid of some bucks for ten bucks and maybe that would help supplement christmas 
00:25:56	00:25:58	1	a little bit well yeah 
00:25:58	00:26:05	2	but anyway that's going to be a whole nother thing the shared cod with you know me having a sin 
00:26:05	00:26:06	1	four hundred twenty five dollars a month 
00:26:08	00:26:11	1	um anyway well those things in a while 
00:26:11	00:26:20	2	well i i should get my race and then i figure all set up a class a day or so that that brings in some money is not the most something in the world to do but 
00:26:20	00:26:21	1	yeah but it's doable 
00:26:21	00:26:30	2	yes it does bring the money will be prepared for them to cut us off soon <unk> oh okay <unk> bussed in and say we have to hang up on on on cable 
00:26:30	00:26:32	1	it always call you back and forth in the middle of anything 
00:26:32	00:26:37	2	yes well i don't think we are but that is sleeping downstairs

00:28:35	00:28:37	1	um she would 
00:28:37	00:28:45	2	uh want me to extend so there wouldn't be so much pressure and go seven years instead of six if it weren't for the money [laughter] it doesn't matter about the money yeah yeah
