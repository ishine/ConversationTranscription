00:02:10	00:02:14	2	yeah so i don't know maybe she'll catch on so 
00:02:14	00:02:21	1	burn a lot of calories an hour the lifting weights uh-huh but uh yeah i mean you're not gonna i don't think you're going to lose that much 
00:02:21	00:02:27	2	and also lifting weights at bally's means you're standing on line as for as much time as you're actually and lifting 
00:02:27	00:02:30	1	really yeah that's true yeah 
00:02:30	00:02:34	2	so it's is it really overcrowded well
