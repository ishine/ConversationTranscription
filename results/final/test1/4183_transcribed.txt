00:18:06	00:18:15	2	seeing that would be nice myself a note here right susan [laughter] i need to get back at it just so hard to keep in touch with everybody 
00:18:15	00:18:20	1	[noise] you have so much to do since you don't have to clean the house and you don't have to win 
00:18:20	00:18:31	2	[laughter] well none of the main thing is people don't write me back i stopped writing [laughter] i get kind of funny about that but then i'll get motivated say well hell i'm on our rights

00:19:02	00:19:03	1	[laughter] 
00:19:03	00:19:06	2	when you consider having cleaned it toilet and about eight months 
00:19:06	00:19:10	1	that's pretty good [laughter] 
00:19:10	00:19:23	2	yeah it's one of the added i mean there are definitely pluses and minuses to living here if anybody would you know just go well god she's got a maid they don't realize what we have to put up with every day i mean like
