00:19:35	00:19:36	1	mhm 
00:19:36	00:19:40	2	uh-huh and they generally beginning to raise it the same time they do the <unk> mhm 
00:19:40	00:19:41	1	so which makes sense to me 
00:19:41	00:19:43	2	mhm 
00:19:43	00:19:43	1	mhm 
00:19:43	00:19:56	2	so anyways what they what they said was that the bonuses would actually probably equal out to close to the amount that i would have gotten if they'd figure it out back to pay for the three months that i didn't get my race for 
00:19:56	00:20:06	1	<unk> mhm so if i figure right it's about six hundred bucks so mhm six or seven something like that so i'm i'm guessing they raised 
00:20:06	00:20:14	2	three hundred dollars or the bonus uh-huh that's excellent yeah that'll be nice yeah nice little nice little 
00:20:14	00:20:17	1	great good i got a raise too 
00:20:17	00:20:19	2	yes 
00:20:19	00:20:22	1	good we came back from vacation and i had to let her i got a really 
00:20:22	00:20:31	2	that's great how how much was years were spent five percent great syntax sick yeah it's great that's good 
00:20:31	00:20:32	1	yeah 
00:20:32	00:20:35	2	oh be helpful huh yeah we'll be [laughter] 
00:20:35	00:20:39	1	oh <unk> yeah yep [noise] 
00:20:39	00:20:41	2	so anything else 
00:20:41	00:20:47	1	um well let's see 
00:20:47	00:20:48	2	really 
00:20:48	00:20:51	1	i hear you're helping join a lot with decorations for her wedding 
00:20:51	00:20:57	2	um not yet not yet i don't know exactly what i'm doing well oh 
00:20:57	00:20:59	1	that something what you being in charge of 
00:21:06	00:21:07	1	mhm

00:21:23	00:21:24	2	yeah 
00:21:27	00:21:29	2	right

00:21:42	00:21:43	1	great 
00:21:43	00:21:45	2	so yeah around the dentist i guess when i

00:22:11	00:22:17	2	right so anyway and it'll be nice and then she's 
00:22:17	00:22:17	1	mhm 
00:22:17	00:22:26	2	she was telling me that um michael's going to be ring beer [noise] oh yeah yeah and it rained was was wondering what he got to 
00:22:26	00:22:27	1	wow 
00:22:27	00:22:32	2	and he was saying something about if you could carry flowers or something like that 
00:22:32	00:22:34	1	so i said well 
00:22:34	00:22:40	2	did you have rain and bethany go up the aisle it's real flowers yeah what'd she say 
00:22:40	00:22:45	1	she said she would um talk about it more she thought that was kind of a neat idea 
00:22:45	00:22:46	2	yeah 
00:22:46	00:22:47	1	she was wondering if they would do it 
00:22:52	00:22:57	2	i think she would that would be <unk> especially if she was with ryan <unk> 
00:22:57	00:22:58	1	yeah right 
00:22:58	00:23:00	2	and uh ryan's old enough to 
00:23:00	00:23:05	1	i think he's where we'd have to do that by that he will i mean he's he'll be three and a half 
00:23:05	00:23:16	2	[noise] and she's one of the <unk> you know by then she just by then she's she'll be almost too yeah i mean she she she follows directions now 
00:23:16	00:23:17	1	mhm 
00:23:17	00:23:20	2	you know she pick something off before you tell her to go put it in the garbage 
00:23:21	00:23:31	2	you know and any time we take her diaper off or whatever and and you know playing them before she picks it up and goes to put it in the garbage mhm you know so she can follow the directions mhm 
00:23:31	00:23:38	1	yeah i mean she could do it with all the people scare her out of it i don't think so because she's not 
00:23:38	00:23:47	2	at all not shy people well gosh wouldn't that be the cutest thing you've ever seen yeah that'd be so cute <unk> that'd be so nice 
00:23:47	00:23:55	1	you'd have to see you know <unk> the other thing i was thinking is different isn't offer mhm it wouldn't be totally inappropriate for him to be kind of up in the front 
00:23:55	00:23:59	2	you know great kinda crouching down if daddy's there 
00:23:59	00:24:03	1	she go yeah problem right she'd go 
00:24:03	00:24:16	2	you know especially you know if i if i sent her off and daddy was down there she'd yeah go and and alright would have to do was would we take her hand and you know he gets her flowers and she'd probably follow suit if she didn't know what to do 
00:24:16	00:24:18	1	right 
00:24:31	00:24:36	1	you might as well do the flowers yeah yeah so [laughter] we'll see what they 
00:24:36	00:24:41	2	right that's cool yeah that'd be kinda fun yeah she's such a cute 
00:24:41	00:24:47	1	[noise] yeah yeah i think we're doing that i'm doing the january passing up programs and

00:24:51	00:24:58	1	yeah so that keeps personal attendance yeah yeah whenever that means exactly 
00:25:09	00:25:17	1	[noise] i guess so yeah i think so [laughter] that's what my personal attendant did and help me with my makeup and meet you my here it was perfect 
00:25:17	00:25:23	2	uh-huh yeah yeah so you're lucky it'll be good at that yeah i wouldn't be good at that 
00:25:23	00:25:26	1	i'm not that type 
00:25:26	00:25:28	2	i <unk> you know 
00:25:28	00:25:29	1	i'd do it but 
00:25:29	00:25:41	2	sure about not like you have to have a title to do those things but i think <unk> you know what i think actually is that she there was too many sisters they couldn't have any of them in the stand up for that 
00:25:41	00:25:42	1	uh-huh 
00:25:42	00:25:45	2	and so that but they don't want anybody to feel not 
00:25:49	00:25:53	2	i kind of did with my friends 
00:25:53	00:25:54	1	mhm 
00:25:54	00:26:12	2	um like cherry brown i had her as my personal attendant [laughter] she came late um well not late to the wedding but she didn't get there 'til like the middle of the morning mhm and also she really wasn't there to help me get dressed or anything right you know but it didn't matter she was i think 
00:26:12	00:26:16	1	yes too yeah but i'm sure you know mom and becky 
00:26:16	00:26:19	2	and to want to they were over there right yeah oh

00:26:41	00:26:46	1	yeah tell me what you were thinking what was i thinking yeah 
00:27:04	00:27:06	1	uh-huh do you know what i mean uh-huh 
00:27:06	00:27:16	2	because when we were swimming well first of all they were off the wedding i mean our agenda as we're not matched up because they were at the wedding and we went to eat and then they came back and they were hungry 'cause they didn't get much there really wasn't anything to eat it 
00:27:16	00:27:18	1	wedding so they went on something 
00:27:31	00:27:36	1	hi anne but [laughter] yeah anyways it's interesting 
00:27:36	00:27:58	2	yeah [laughter] well they probably they probably they probably they probably really had a good time this because they don't have that much well they don't have that much chance in a way yeah to be together i don't know anyway but yeah yeah it's just kind of strange mhm [laughter] it's it's unusual for me to see joanna 
00:27:58	00:28:01	1	being like that too 
00:28:01	00:28:05	2	yeah you know yeah anyway 
00:28:05	00:28:08	1	yeah that's interesting yeah 
00:28:08	00:28:14	2	but it just kind of didn't offend me as just like okay guys you know 
00:28:14	00:28:20	1	it's sort of like they're on her little you know this is their little outing thing and we were just kind of there 
00:28:25	00:28:29	2	[laughter] yeah yeah 
00:28:29	00:28:33	1	i think she was a little bit disgusted that we watched a movie on saturday 
00:28:33	00:28:35	2	oh yes 
00:28:35	00:28:35	1	yeah 
00:28:35	00:28:37	2	oh well 
00:28:37	00:28:38	1	she wanted to do something 
00:28:38	00:28:45	2	no uh-huh and which is all fine and dandy but it's like it's raining outside or all tired 
00:28:49	00:28:57	1	you know [noise] so anyways and finally bought some cards and played cards and watch the movie but she was so funny 'cause she didn't wanna watch movie 'cause you get so engrossed 
00:28:57	00:28:58	2	the movie she says 
00:28:58	00:29:01	1	when you know when she's what when there's a movie on 
00:29:01	00:29:11	2	not much of a social bug baron talk much and she wanted to spend some time talking <unk> you know we're visiting or whatever it's like well you know just visit that 
00:29:11	00:29:13	1	you know don't watch the movie 
00:29:13	00:29:18	2	it was just kind of funny she hit her own little agenda i think she wanted to do 
00:29:19	00:29:25	2	very focused on you know this is what i want to do and i think i'm going to be kind of upset if we don't do what i want to do 
00:29:25	00:29:29	1	[noise] she's kinda that way sometimes yes she is 
00:29:29	00:29:38	2	[laughter] i don't know why i don't know either unless unless that's what she thought she really wanted to do i don't know it could have 
00:29:38	00:29:42	1	you know but hey let him speak up yeah 
00:29:42	00:29:45	2	see anything one way or the other you know yeah
