00:08:10	00:08:13	1	yeah well i i i did facts 
00:08:13	00:08:21	2	a letter it was a little bit after that date like maybe a week later yeah i fax him a letter and i never heard from them and i 
00:08:21	00:08:24	1	kind of said is you know come and we'll talk 
00:08:24	00:08:34	2	uh-huh yeah so basically the one okay well insurance for peace attracted their offer 'cause they decided i wasn't enthusiastic 
00:08:34	00:08:36	1	yeah we just um interns 
00:08:36	00:08:38	2	peace mhm 
00:08:38	00:08:40	1	offered me a place and then they took it back 
00:08:40	00:08:43	2	but then you also so you <unk> 
00:08:43	00:08:49	1	wasn't but i still would have rather rejected them they don't have them check me yeah and then um 
00:08:49	00:08:51	2	[noise] and then the next place 
00:08:51	00:08:53	1	which i was so helpful 
00:08:53	00:08:55	2	that was was um 
00:08:55	00:08:58	1	well i don't any sun yeah hi 
00:08:58	00:09:07	2	when you're young woman's leadership program and the woman made it sound so promising and i waited two months to hear back and then i haven't heard from her and it was after the dates 
00:09:07	00:09:09	1	called mhm 
00:09:09	00:09:16	2	oh i was gonna affect you this evening um you know we're not really sure what's happening the position maybe being redefined 
00:09:16	00:09:17	1	yeah and then 
00:09:17	00:09:25	2	week later she called me and left a message saying you know they had all these things in the back burner and i should really look someplace else because they don't know 
00:09:25	00:09:27	1	what's going on and 
00:09:27	00:09:33	2	and so i had really stop looking for things 'cause she made it sound so promising and like it was going to be almost full time 
00:09:36	00:09:45	2	you know so instead of now it's like you know maybe a ten hour week position and required is fluent hebrew and it's just totally different than what we had talked about 
00:09:45	00:09:46	1	that's a shame 
00:09:46	00:09:52	2	and so then meanwhile <unk> i had offered me a a very short term 
00:09:54	00:10:00	2	yeah like helping with grant writing and miscellaneous things and living on a nearby keyboards maybe is it money 
00:10:07	00:10:10	1	but anyway so then 
00:10:10	00:10:12	2	but that was three months 
00:10:12	00:10:13	1	if they offered me that 
00:10:13	00:10:20	2	who knows if they found someone so i <unk> them about a week and a half ago and i had on her back from them and so i 
00:10:20	00:10:25	1	i called the new york office and she said she'd get back to me probably you know yesterday or today as soon as 
00:10:25	00:10:38	2	he could talk with them mhm because maybe they found someone i don't know yeah so that's i'm i'm really hoping that that would work out you know it's something yeah but if not i mean i'm just coming any way but i have no idea like we're all go 
00:10:38	00:10:40	1	what are you planning coming 
00:10:40	00:10:45	2	some time either like mid to late september or early october 
00:10:45	00:10:47	1	mhm mhm um 
00:10:47	00:10:53	2	[noise] 'cause i'm thinking that i'd like to stop in europe on the way and visit some friends i have a friend in 
00:10:53	00:10:56	1	spain and a friend in france and germany 
00:10:56	00:11:06	2	oh that can be fun so i'd like to see them on the way and especially if i have nothing lined up there's no reason i can't <unk> weeks and see part of europe and 
00:11:06	00:11:08	1	free now use it when you can [laughter] 
00:11:08	00:11:13	2	unemployed [laughter] [laughter] yeah well that sounds fun though 
00:11:13	00:11:17	1	so i mean all becoming some time you know in the fall but i don't know he's actually went in that 
00:11:17	00:11:21	2	oh i talked to um just <unk>

00:13:53	00:13:59	2	to stay here a little longer i thought i would go down early to help mom get ready for the wedding yeah it'd be a lot more fun 
00:13:59	00:14:01	1	like to hang out here a little i mean 
00:14:08	00:14:10	1	when did you finish working um

00:14:26	00:14:27	1	but i mean 
00:14:27	00:14:30	2	and i think she's going to have the new year round trip thing anyway 
00:14:30	00:14:33	1	she's going to have to get back which i don't know how 
00:14:33	00:14:37	2	cheaper to get a round trip something than than hitch a ride and then try to get a one way ticket

00:14:39	00:14:44	2	i mean i wouldn't mind having a <unk> in the car but i just have so much stuff 
00:14:47	00:15:03	2	oh i don't even think i would be able to get all my stuff back even even um with just me i think i'm gonna have to send some stuff some boxes that johnny for him to take down whenever he goes to south carolina next you know when there's more

00:18:27	00:18:40	2	it's maybe eighteen inches across likes her conference and uh a plate with three dimensional figures on it and it's just beautifully colored and made and i want to get it for mom for a president but i can't afford it by my 
00:18:45	00:18:51	2	and then i'm trying to get to meet you to go in on it with me but he he i think he's sort of planning another present 
00:18:51	00:18:54	1	but maybe like he'll put in a little bit 
00:18:54	00:18:57	2	i could go in i was thinking of going in like about a hundred or something 
00:18:57	00:19:01	1	okay maybe maybe we could like do that together somehow 
00:19:01	00:19:05	2	but i wouldn't want to know pretty soon because i've been i've been looking for stuff 
00:19:05	00:19:08	1	yeah okay well um 
00:19:08	00:19:14	2	practical i mean is it is it five hundred dollars nice it's beautiful i mean i might be able to bark and 
00:19:14	00:19:17	1	down a little bit but it was supposed to be five hundred and fifty 
00:19:17	00:19:18	2	it'll be laid off 
00:19:24	00:19:26	1	and i really wanted to give them something 
00:19:26	00:19:28	2	and i took 
00:19:28	00:19:29	1	picture so i can 
00:19:29	00:19:40	2	i've spent some to dimitri to see if he was interested but i can also send one to mom to succeed does she like it i mean if they if they really like it then we should do it but if they aren't into it then it wouldn't be worth 
00:19:44	00:19:49	1	well we could um we can email i could have dimitri email you 
00:19:49	00:19:54	2	okay then you know try to or you've also got my socks and the factory don't you mhm 
00:19:54	00:19:58	1	i think so anyway

00:20:02	00:20:03	1	yeah yeah yeah 
00:20:03	00:20:06	2	yeah i can <unk> 
00:20:06	00:20:08	1	tried it i mean as soon as <unk> um in fact 
00:20:08	00:20:10	2	probably in in some of them actually 
00:20:10	00:20:11	1	going to be in tel aviv i've got to go 
00:20:11	00:20:20	2	see uh for a test their doctor something but then uh i was thinking i was going to some shopping some final you know president shopping <unk> 
00:20:20	00:20:22	1	that was one thing that was gonna be trying to look for 
00:20:22	00:20:35	2	okay well um in addition i i actually got to also they have the you know the music festival thing here so i got <unk> uh a tee shirt and uh <unk> uh with the <unk> the teachers just gotten up strapped chamber of music 
00:20:35	00:20:43	1	the whole thing on it uh-huh that's nice to him [laughter] that's good [noise] um ah are you okay laurie um 
00:20:43	00:21:01	2	i've been having headaches dizziness and i paying for like a month and a half oh no and they don't know what it's from and i went to i mean i went to the eye doctor and to the gynecologist and i've had an e._e._g. and i'm having a cat 
00:21:01	00:21:05	1	of the brain done next week if i'm 
00:21:05	00:21:18	2	it's probably gonna be as i say just in my head like <unk> maybe i don't know uh-huh but when it hits me it's i mean i've quite a few times had just to have to go home and just go to bed i couldn't 
00:21:20	00:21:23	1	spinning and focus is it like a migraine or anything 
00:21:23	00:21:31	2	it could be but it's not <unk> i don't really know if that's what the the doctor thought maybe and if it's migrants is that it could be <unk> a logical 
00:21:31	00:21:36	1	because it seems as if the <unk> like it came the first time came two months ago came with them period 
00:21:36	00:21:42	2	exactly mhm and then last for about two and a half three weeks and then went away for about a week week and a half 
00:21:42	00:21:49	1	i won't say it was every day of the two and a half weeks but you know on and off quite a bit over that period and then it came back again exactly when i got my period again 
00:21:49	00:21:51	2	mhm 
00:21:51	00:21:55	1	and what really scared me that is it really is the next time is exactly what they learn to the 
00:21:55	00:21:59	2	oh i see i knew that like a home that 
00:21:59	00:22:00	1	yeah 
00:22:00	00:22:08	2	so i actually went off the pill for this like for the two months i don't know if that's you know we'll make a difference or not 
00:22:08	00:22:15	1	and uh they gave me some sort of a free menopausal migraine something medication 
00:22:15	00:22:16	2	i don't see 
00:22:16	00:22:19	1	really helping much it may be a bit 
00:22:19	00:22:28	2	but uh anyway uh we're testing checking everything out already yeah it's a real pain is i mean it is scary [laughter] 
00:22:28	00:22:29	1	yeah i i won't say 
00:22:29	00:22:35	2	really worried about it being anything horrible mhm but just i <unk> 
00:22:35	00:22:38	1	i've got this business i just don't i'm not in control myself 
00:22:38	00:22:44	2	yeah and the thing is it now it's getting worse because like i've i've missed a couple of days of work because they've been feeling crummy 
00:22:44	00:22:45	1	yeah and then i've got a <unk> 
00:22:45	00:22:49	2	work piling up and um racing against the clock 
00:22:49	00:22:53	1	to get things done before i leave right and then i get probably more nervous and that makes it even 
00:22:53	00:22:57	2	<unk> oh no no [laughter] 
00:22:57	00:22:59	1	this is now 
00:22:59	00:23:07	2	yeah but ah hopefully we'll be okay i haven't <unk> i mean i haven't seen anything to mom about my mother <unk> i'd say there's no reason 
00:23:07	00:23:09	1	can i tell my mom 
00:23:09	00:23:13	2	didn't mention it i mean you don't <unk> i don't care you can or you can't do this
