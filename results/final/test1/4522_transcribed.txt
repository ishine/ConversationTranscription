00:13:45	00:13:46	2	mhm 
00:13:46	00:13:49	2	breaking the skin there's no evidence that anything bit me 
00:13:51	00:13:53	2	oh when you read that 
00:13:53	00:13:58	1	he said that there is no breaking the scanned there's no evidence it anything bit me 
00:13:58	00:13:59	2	no yeah 
00:13:59	00:14:05	1	but he said it's <unk> it's an infection and the skin that's how it was so swollen and 
00:14:05	00:14:07	2	right and it's really hot too the touch too 
00:14:07	00:14:08	1	mhm 
00:14:08	00:14:13	2	and he said he has no idea why i got it it's kind of going into the strange things 
00:14:13	00:14:15	1	yeah 
00:14:15	00:14:20	2	so he gave me an antibiotic 
00:14:21	00:14:25	2	which i've taken for two days now and so far just seem to have made any difference 
00:14:27	00:14:28	1	i was kinda hoping that yeah 
00:14:28	00:14:30	2	it would go away 
00:14:31	00:14:33	1	i just told me take aspirin but 
00:14:33	00:14:35	2	when it hurts <unk> you know

00:14:37	00:14:38	2	well 
00:14:38	00:14:42	2	it's the kind of thing that it's i don't think aspirin really gonna help 
00:14:42	00:14:45	1	i don't know 
00:14:45	00:14:52	2	it's just real sort of a touchy aspirin doesn't seem to do much for like <unk> and things like that

00:15:01	00:15:02	1	well 
00:15:02	00:15:05	2	i guess partly because of you know what happened to 
00:15:05	00:15:08	2	dennis before when he started to swell up 
00:15:08	00:15:12	1	yeah and that's pretty close to your head
