00:00:25	00:00:32	1	was it um i mean did you have to do where you sick the rest of the day or did you feel bad 
00:00:32	00:00:41	2	i was pretty goofy for about twenty four hours at uh-huh yeah it was it was i mean it wasn't like anything like that is fun but it was really kind of interesting i didn't believe how efficient they are 
00:00:41	00:00:43	1	really where which uh place that you have 
00:00:43	00:00:52	2	done it a methodist hospital huh and um i had duck three and he's from uh india dr <unk> and 
00:00:52	00:00:54	1	no not no ray 
00:00:54	00:00:56	2	yeah it is 
00:00:56	00:01:04	1	ray his first initial as as some thomas looking at the heat because tom took me the next day to get my bandages change and stuff at the clinic uh-huh and 
00:01:04	00:01:13	2	and he goes ooh it's stevie ray [laughter] but i don't think so i think it's more what <unk> 
00:01:13	00:01:15	1	see more mhm 
00:01:15	00:01:20	2	<unk> too much money do you talk like a <unk> uh-huh 
00:01:38	00:01:42	2	mm mm mm that's funny 
00:01:42	00:01:46	1	and so what what are you gonna do for today 
00:01:46	00:01:51	2	well i think we're going to stay in because it's going to be like over a hundred degree your kid uh 
00:01:51	00:01:53	1	has a he returned them no 
00:02:01	00:02:15	2	really i read that in like in chicago they said they're preparing for another heat wave mhm but then i watch sunday morning or part is sunday morning and it didn't it showed it only in the eighties some like somebody's not telling the truth here it's hot over here though too 
00:02:15	00:02:16	1	oh it it's real 
00:02:16	00:02:25	2	i think when you let's see you'll become an <unk> last year i remember that it was rainy in august but this year so bizarre that you might hit it when it's really nice 
00:02:25	00:02:32	1	mm that'd be cool i mean it's just been unreal bad here really dry humid mhm the other day we went to see water 
00:02:32	00:02:36	2	uh-huh it's kind of yeah it's kinda good is it worth it i mean 
00:02:36	00:02:39	1	there was a lot of hype or whatever that it was not going to be 
00:02:39	00:02:48	2	well because they spend so much money i like it i think for the amount of money that was spent it's it's not them you know it's not not blockbuster maker 
00:02:48	00:02:52	1	but it was good really i mean it's just you sit there and it's very tense 'cause it's 
00:02:52	00:03:05	2	action on it it's all action mhm and um it was fun watching the credits and the credits rolled for at least a half hour i waited for half time went outside he goes i'm not into this he goes you can watch i said that's why i watched it 
00:03:05	00:03:07	1	for a half an hour 
00:03:07	00:03:21	2	'cause i don't know it's just it's just funny because i could not believe how many different things were involved in this movie and i figured there would be so i wanted to watch it and it was it was still rolling after half hour you know it was a half hour where the credits 
00:03:35	00:03:37	2	moving [laughter] those those are 
00:03:37	00:03:38	1	that's my attention span 
00:03:38	00:03:40	2	like i'm <unk> 
00:03:40	00:03:50	1	it is here i can't watch anything over two hours is okay when it get yeah two and a half hours is like no way even if it's the best movie i have to watch and hearts and that's when i have 
00:03:50	00:04:00	2	on video it was it was a bit long because of you know you're dealing with the same there there it's a cartoon mentality type of film but the actions interesting the special 
00:04:00	00:04:01	1	good 
00:04:01	00:04:06	2	yeah it's okay the kid there was a kid in there that's really fun you'd like a kid 'cause she's just

00:25:37	00:25:40	2	but i thought well you know it's just <unk> i took it in 
00:25:40	00:25:48	1	the wheels on line and these guys go can you even look at this and they put one of the rams machine it was i'll bet 
00:25:48	00:25:58	2	<unk> big time i mean my nephew was hard on the car i think you can get stuck in the mode a few times and things like that uh-huh so it was kinda funny 
00:25:58	00:26:04	1	hey i gotta tell ya did i talk to since i went out on that woman that has forty personalities 
00:26:04	00:26:06	2	you told me a little bit about the <unk> 
00:26:06	00:26:08	1	raped the other night or 
00:26:08	00:26:21	2	somebody got raped in the night [laughter] yeah rape or and then when they were doing and it she says she called the hospital or whatever you said that was <unk> she got raped 
00:26:21	00:26:22	1	one she's nuts 
00:26:22	00:26:33	2	she's absolutely nuts uh-huh and she <unk> she asked uh she told a nurse i want charlotte to come out and i'm like there's no show one of the personalities no 
00:26:34	00:26:39	2	that's a given mel on one sure charlotte come out oh no 
00:26:39	00:26:42	1	anyway she was 
00:26:42	00:26:52	2	she was referring to me because anytime i hear chelsea or something there is no charlotte but there is a select and that's probably who she means and she's at in that and i'm sure it's the same 
00:26:52	00:26:55	1	<unk> they called you charlotte she called yeah she told me 
00:26:55	00:27:04	2	i want charlotte to meet me at the hospital right and it's like we don't have a charlotte but i'm sure that's me so i figured it must have been hurt anyway mhm she's like real 
00:27:04	00:27:09	1	melanie she's really what really nuts uh-huh oh yeah she goes 
00:27:09	00:27:20	2	two three year old boys and i think part of it is it's sad because whether she's acting or not she still crazy and when she went so anyway i was with her 
00:27:20	00:27:22	1	right right 
00:27:22	00:27:35	2	and then like two or three nights later she called the hospital get i didn't go out because i wasn't on call sure but another <unk> a woman who works with me she went out and when they were doing the rape exam uh-huh they pulled out 
00:27:35	00:27:36	1	eight cockroach 
00:27:36	00:27:46	2	out of her for china oh my god anywhere like i just lost it because all i can imagine it's like you know in his science <unk> oh my god 
00:27:46	00:27:47	1	you know 
00:27:47	00:28:00	2	jarred [laughter] oh my god how does it get there i think that she probably put it there or something she's pretty nuts i i i seriously doubt 
00:28:00	00:28:03	1	you don't actually got raped no i i just don't 
00:28:03	00:28:14	2	well you <unk> how <unk> how could you tell with with somebody who who is like that exact really difficult episode it certainly i mean what's that called enough with the kids that we used to work with exactly you know and 
00:28:14	00:28:16	1	and he does a lot of us 
00:28:16	00:28:24	2	self mutilation earlier and stuff like that so that makes me think of fatal attractions last night yeah she has like the cross 
00:28:24	00:28:28	1	you want to see my she goes into those three year old boy she she goes oh 
00:28:28	00:28:48	2	and it's really sad i mean whether she's nuts or whatever uh acting or if whether she has forty personalities or not she still crazy so [noise] but um she had like um cross mark upside down crosses on her stomach and um <unk> she she would draw and um 
00:28:48	00:28:49	1	right um 
00:28:52	00:28:54	1	right i otherwise how would you do right 
00:28:54	00:29:10	2	but i mean that that cockroach thing it sounds to me like either she one of her personality either participate in that kind of abuse that ritual right sure if that really will activity or it's real weird though i mean it's just like because i've talked with 
00:29:10	00:29:12	1	so many times 
00:29:22	00:29:27	2	i'm like when i was talking to her at the house so i go why i've never met you before i met ash 
00:29:27	00:29:28	1	which is personally

00:29:35	00:29:37	1	nineteen so weird though 
00:29:37	00:29:50	2	got a real simple yeah oh really is how weird it is pretty <unk> yeah so yeah anyway but um yeah i was going to ask you 
00:29:50	00:29:51	1	totally opposite
