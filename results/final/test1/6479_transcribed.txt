00:20:46	00:20:50	2	so anyway but that's all that i've i've paid attention to so 
00:20:50	00:20:51	1	uh-huh 
00:20:51	00:21:01	2	so no i i'm i'm taking french the fear and i haven't seen my french teacher back in town yet so [laughter] so i mean maybe they aren't over 
00:21:01	00:21:05	1	no <unk> well i hope they are over because she was really 
00:21:05	00:21:10	2	it's usually bombing about that too <unk> took some road trip out of the city 'cause she just couldn't 
00:21:10	00:21:11	1	any more 
00:21:11	00:21:16	2	really yeah well how does she like the course is she doing a p._h._d. 
00:21:16	00:21:25	1	she's doing a one year and she's not getting a degree from it as far as i can tell but she was originally got a new economics courses and work part time at the 
00:21:25	00:21:33	2	uh not the world bank but it's some sort of similar organization affiliated with me a european economic community or something something i don't know 
00:21:33	00:21:36	1	right um but that fell through 
00:21:36	00:21:39	2	for the first semester the work opportunity and the 
00:21:39	00:21:46	1	the economics courses that turned up that she'd done basically all that work uh at school already in college and 
00:21:46	00:21:48	2	mhm so 
00:21:48	00:21:50	1	she wasn't thrilled 
00:21:50	00:21:58	2	that she decided to stop taking those courses and just sort of odd it a bunch of uh you know our history and things it seemed more interesting to her 
00:21:58	00:21:59	1	yeah i mean 
00:21:59	00:22:06	2	i think it's a totally sweet deal like they pay for her everything and all she's in the news you not do anything she just had a sort of be there 
00:22:06	00:22:10	1	yeah that's so cool yeah totally um 
00:22:10	00:22:20	2	um and and now she's gotten the job for this semester at wherever it is that you're supposed to work she's happy about that 'cause she's felt i think she's about what she said too much free time and really not enough 
00:22:20	00:22:24	1	[noise] sense of what to do with it and unfortunately 
00:22:24	00:22:45	2	cold or mile is sort of known for not being the most friendly place study apparently the students really <unk> um like exceptionally so and so she felt that and i haven't really made friends she can hang out with which is really too bad 'cause if you're at a foreign country and you don't feel like there's anybody that you can hang out with that can be really isolating um 
00:22:45	00:22:47	1	but 
00:22:47	00:22:50	2	but i think i think it'll be better for her because 
00:22:52	00:23:02	2	[noise] you see and she decided to join up she finally found a club she likes to just go join them didn't work out you know it'd be a completely fat free person [laughter] but 
00:23:02	00:23:04	1	[laughter] 
00:23:09	00:23:20	2	you know she's been helpful to me because like when i first started losing weight i really wanted and you know with like figuring out what to eat and what not to eat and what not exercise and everything and i wrote to her i was like well actually my virtual trainer 
00:23:20	00:23:22	1	tell me actually eat this and 
00:23:22	00:23:28	2	how often do this and she was really good on that obviously 'cause she thinks about all the time 
00:23:28	00:23:29	1	what do you eat now 
00:23:29	00:23:36	2	[noise] oh i don't eat anything i just drink water all the time no well right now the the dining halls clothes 
00:23:36	00:23:38	1	so basically i just need a lot of salads 
00:23:38	00:23:44	2	[noise] um i eat a lot of fat free stuff i've been watching fat content a lot um mhm i eat less 
00:23:44	00:23:45	1	everything 
00:23:45	00:23:50	2	um and when i mean the snack instead of running to the vending machine like i always did in north house 
00:23:50	00:23:52	1	i yeah i always 
00:24:02	00:24:05	1	when when term time rolls around you know i have like uh 
00:24:05	00:24:10	2	you know my usual breakfast like cereal and choose i've cut down on the trees i drink too i drink a lot more water 
00:24:24	00:24:28	1	so <unk> you know and then <unk> 
00:24:28	00:24:32	2	but yeah it's and it really give it the food is really is not that good and my dining hall 
00:24:32	00:24:34	1	so <unk> so it's easier 
00:24:34	00:24:42	2	given that to just sort of put myself into a routine where i eat the same thing the same sort of standard blah thing every day and then i'll i'll [noise] every couple of weeks 
00:24:42	00:24:48	1	or like on the weekend i'll have like french toast you know for <unk> for one day and i'm like what i look forward to 
00:24:48	00:24:59	2	so it's not like a completely you know unlimited but of course i had you know chocolate over christmas and i had you know you know i ate the turkey with the gravy and all that 
00:24:59	00:25:02	1	but generally i'm just really cut down 
00:25:02	00:25:08	2	and you know i've i've been going to aerobics all semester um they have aerobics 
00:25:08	00:25:09	1	and i've been going to a movie 
00:25:22	00:25:30	2	well just get in shape [noise] um and it's really worked out well they really had it myself my friend michelle is like really skinny 
00:25:30	00:25:32	1	uh-huh 
00:25:32	00:25:40	2	as well because i i've never i i don't consider myself to be like attractive but i don't want to be <unk> you know 
00:25:40	00:25:42	1	oh i 
00:25:46	00:25:48	1	oh no kidding 
00:25:51	00:25:59	1	yeah it's really good and [noise] i mean i you know i don't know if i wrote this at all but i was considering for a while i was considering transferring back to harvard 
00:25:59	00:26:06	2	because you know yeah you know who was writing to me and ah uh-huh and saying you know 
00:26:27	00:26:38	2	<unk> yeah and i'm going to do it um mhm present with him on a panel which is so great and not boston and you know he's like happy when would you be through it and everything and 
00:26:38	00:26:47	1	and and i was really tempted because like i haven't met anyone here yet who could be that kind of an adviser you know right no i mean 'cause he's so 
00:26:47	00:26:53	2	for me and really like has made it very clear that he's willing to you know really good about from me which is really not 
00:26:53	00:26:56	1	yeah and i always like oh no i 
00:27:12	00:27:21	2	had the chance to get to work with people that i originally came here to work with and i and i will this next semester but i need to make the decision to apply you know 
00:27:21	00:27:23	1	last month um 
00:27:23	00:27:32	2	i wasn't gonna apply if i wasn't going to go because i want to have the option if things don't work out this year to apply next year you know what i'm saying 
00:27:32	00:27:34	1	yeah 
00:27:50	00:27:54	2	i'm surprised that you were that you can sit i mean well i was 
00:27:54	00:27:56	1	oh i guess i was surprised that 
00:27:56	00:28:04	2	turned them down in the first place but i mean once you i mean because i remember where you came back from berkeley yeah 'cause you were just like totally sold on it 
00:28:05	00:28:08	2	yeah yeah and then 
00:28:08	00:28:11	1	and it sounds like you're really happy there 
00:28:11	00:28:31	2	no yeah well i mean academically it hasn't been as much fun as it has been socially i've i had new news or classes this fall um mhm and you know there are several people in my cohort he did the exact same schedule and to feel the same way they're just like lame professors lame classes the people in the <unk> great i really liked them 
00:28:31	00:28:32	1	mhm 
00:28:32	00:28:36	2	you know the work just hasn't been as as fun as i thought it would be 
00:28:36	00:28:38	1	i don't think 
00:28:38	00:28:50	2	i don't think it's just like grad school versus college i think it's actually like to sort of poorly taught poorly organized classes but they're not with people that i plan to do my work with so okay i really can't judge the <unk> 
00:28:50	00:28:52	1	based on that and also the libraries sucks 
00:28:52	00:28:58	2	<unk> like i really i'm <unk> i'm in l._a. it really sucks um 
00:28:58	00:28:59	1	and they just renovated 
00:28:59	00:29:07	2	the damn thing too and they're like really proud of it but it's it's so it's not a place where you can get any work done um 
00:29:07	00:29:15	1	i mean what about the books and journals that they have i mean do that because then the perspective i mean the thing that they sent me the really proud of the library and then 
00:29:15	00:29:29	2	the the library i mean the chances of finding the book on the shelf or very small there's been so much theft that i think numbers the numbers are not right because i think they still count books that are gone oh they will not read order books that are stolen 
00:29:29	00:29:31	1	but he only not only request and they don't 
00:29:31	00:29:37	2	budget for it um right budget or like their response to everything they um 
00:29:37	00:29:38	1	uh-huh 
00:29:38	00:29:50	2	we've got about five more minutes i think they um they uh distracting here they um loan out a lot of things to the other u._c. 
00:29:50	00:29:52	1	because they share 
00:29:52	00:29:59	2	[noise] they have their own online catalogue but then they have one that's a big on line catalogue it's shared by all the u._c.s [noise] and the result
