00:00:03	00:00:11	2	i'm fine um how things been okay we just finished making tiny tiny supper oh wow 
00:00:11	00:00:13	1	oh it's actually a recipe for 
00:00:13	00:00:25	2	chicken which one's copied out of a cook book a year's a million years ago you little <unk> used to have a little paperback chinese cooking for too huh boy i don't even remember that a million years ago 
00:00:25	00:00:27	1	but the rest of them that's neat 
00:00:27	00:00:32	2	that's good i made egg rolls actually it's funny i had this thing 
00:00:32	00:00:40	1	covering for the egg rolls that million mid used by you mhm but it turned when i did mine were okay but they're not the same 'cause mine too that were rice flour and i don't think hers 
00:00:40	00:00:47	2	flower you know i think as weird as it sounds i think hers might be <unk> flower oh maybe 
00:00:47	00:00:48	1	you know i'm not sure i mean they 
00:00:48	00:00:52	2	look the same before they're cooked yeah no it's not we flower 
00:00:52	00:00:55	1	uh-huh 'cause they have that sort of translucent look i don't know 
00:00:55	00:01:10	2	because i mean they looked identical they're awesome and then you can see the markings <unk> right right but when i fry and there were very easy to use that when they finally did they were kind of a different <unk> even though it tasted fine yeah you know i think the ones that <unk> 
00:01:10	00:01:18	1	because i mean i don't know what sort of nationality you get there but the ones that she uses i don't think are actually chinese i think they're either vietnamese or thai

00:01:28	00:01:29	1	[laughter] there 
00:01:29	00:01:41	2	and then i mean i'm using something a little bit nervous though mhm so i do the same we maimed and it worked for just that it's a little it's a different country it's not a regular egg rolls [laughter] but it was 
00:01:43	00:01:50	2	um what kind of like when you did it amuses <unk> that'll bubbling a lot of the oil got inside oh boy

00:05:07	00:05:09	1	it's not like that but let's just uh 
00:05:09	00:05:19	2	probably about twenty jobs there mhm that are really menial sort of mhm monotonous labor <unk> but there's really willing to do it for any length of time yeah yeah 
00:05:19	00:05:22	1	oh gee 
00:05:22	00:05:27	2	um and we we we built a really nice look at this year i've been with uh you didn't show on

00:05:39	00:05:41	1	[noise] the <unk> in the <unk> 
00:05:55	00:06:00	2	<unk> yeah yeah and i i thought that too about 
00:06:00	00:06:11	1	it's not that i'm religious but i mean sometimes we'll get invited over to the um to the house of the um hasidic rabbi and like after the meal the beer caught him on his own it's like it came back to me the first time from like 
00:06:11	00:06:16	2	thirty years ago where i was thinking you know from <unk> yeah from you know after like 
00:06:16	00:06:20	1	<unk> meals or something so it was kind of interesting 
00:06:20	00:06:31	2	how are they doing is um well actually from dodge it sounds a bit better than <unk> four days at david insidious house yeah um and he said you can talk to me when she knew they were 
00:06:34	00:06:38	2	and um apparently you know does he said it was nice but it was enough 
00:06:38	00:06:39	1	yeah 
00:06:39	00:06:55	2	and um he's getting some parents some very good physical therapy occupational therapy mhm but something i mean she he was getting to a coupon holding but what is going to now i think it's like five days a week for like four 
00:06:55	00:06:57	1	mm wow 
00:07:11	00:07:16	2	apparently it's a very good program that they're paying for them but apparently it's a very good 
00:07:16	00:07:17	1	yeah yeah oh that is 
00:07:17	00:07:31	2	that far from where they live and to like for now maybe usually goes by taxi were frantic him but he couldn't go there by bus but she's she doesn't want him to go yet yeah yeah but things in a little while you know if if things continue previous 
00:07:31	00:07:34	1	probably will be able to that's good that's good well that's kind of 
00:07:34	00:07:49	2	perjury yeah and i mean he is you're walking around [laughter] <unk> not using the walker mhm does he sort of claims that he she thinks he could be doing more for himself and he is <unk> well you know that sounds like darcy and it's hard to know whether it's 
00:07:49	00:07:50	1	to it or not um 
00:07:50	00:08:06	2	well i don't know i remember like with with <unk> with being sick and surely both being sick <unk> was fighting so much and i mean he just everything he <unk> he tried so hard mhm insurance was doing nothing oh wow she 
00:08:06	00:08:12	1	i remember being in the hospital when the tourists finally yo litter <unk> started yelling at her and say look at if you don't 
00:08:19	00:08:21	1	yeah you know i think um 
00:08:21	00:08:30	2	sort of you know something like a business but you know just sort of uh had a kind of be really shocked out of it mhm mhm and then suddenly members started improving it leaps and bounds 
00:08:30	00:08:36	1	yeah yeah i mean i wonder at what point you just feel sort of too tired to fight anymore 
00:08:36	00:08:44	2	[noise] i mean that's sort of what <unk> sounded like she was afraid at the beginning right after the stroke it that's what he was going to be like but it sounds like you have gotten over that 
00:08:56	00:08:57	1	<unk> 
00:08:57	00:09:08	2	even though david nice to each other that certainly doesn't seem like that he'll drive again yeah who knows yeah i just think that would be awfully risky for everybody if he were to drive 
00:09:08	00:09:16	1	i mean hasn't <unk> several strokes no uh no strong this is the first or the 
00:09:34	00:09:41	2	and i <unk> think a <unk> i i think i would trust his judgment <unk> feeling that he's capable 
00:09:45	00:09:47	2	yeah 
00:09:47	00:09:48	1	i don't know i mean you know maybe it would be 
00:09:48	00:09:53	2	and i just know that are grandfather you know <unk> um grammar harris died 
00:09:53	00:09:55	1	you know of a heart attack at the steering wheel 
00:09:55	00:09:57	2	looking back in time to someone's forty also 
00:09:57	00:10:01	1	yeah yeah i mean yeah that is true but you know when you have your older near the history of 
00:10:01	00:10:13	2	yeah did i mean israel the majority of the car accident i think or you know drunk and drive or yeah or dangerous passing and that sort of stuff yeah uh-huh g. um how are you are headaches 
00:10:13	00:10:18	1	um that sounds <unk> are gone the only reason um 
00:10:20	00:10:22	1	sometimes <unk> mm 
00:10:22	00:10:33	2	<unk> when i'm sort of moving the head back and forth mhm looking at something from side to side mhm i've got the appointments uh right that's the day that i feel kind of funny you know <unk> joy 
00:10:33	00:10:36	1	need it but yeah you do i mean 
00:10:36	00:10:39	2	if they don't even think of some you know i should you know finish this 
00:10:39	00:10:43	1	right right i haven't checked just like inner ears 
00:10:43	00:10:46	2	no actually have and i've got to the doctor about that again 
00:10:46	00:10:51	1	i mean is one of the more obvious sort of sources of of dizziness type of thing yeah 
00:11:15	00:11:17	1	the thing that happened after a viral thing 
00:11:23	00:11:25	1	awful i mean it's just ah 
00:11:25	00:11:33	2	but i mean that was completely ear it was like the aftermath of an <unk> you know somehow you know bacteria ended up in the inner ear instead of eating an ear infection i got the <unk> 
00:11:33	00:11:37	1	from it um but i mean that is where you're you know 
00:11:37	00:11:41	2	center in and stuff and you know might be worth checking but 
00:11:41	00:11:44	1	um has i've never had more you know false 
00:11:44	00:11:53	2	so i mean is he just going to wait and see what the <unk> or <unk> i mean we haven't really sat down really disgusted that you know serious i'm just waiting and seeing 
00:11:53	00:11:55	1	yeah yeah 
00:11:55	00:12:05	2	how's things so i guess the hard thing is that how will you know when you know how things are going yeah that makes any sense yeah well i mean i think i i still was going to be getting worse 
00:12:05	00:12:08	1	more so even a little while because uh 
00:12:16	00:12:29	2	yeah well he start studies <unk> <unk> he's done <unk> and <unk> um <unk> maybe <unk> meet him [laughter] he has a serious girlfriend house okay [laughter] 
00:12:29	00:12:29	1	[laughter] 
00:12:29	00:12:35	2	um but ah i'm thinking of definitely can be worse when he's not around 
00:12:35	00:12:37	1	yeah yeah right 
00:12:37	00:12:43	2	oh tell me what what are they um leave the miriam has what um 
00:12:43	00:12:45	1	well she had 
00:12:45	00:12:55	2	her final thing and they sounded encouraging there were two things through shut deal mhm um but i'm not sure you know what they were called one maybe <unk> raised 
00:12:55	00:12:56	1	or something but i've heard of <unk> yeah 
00:12:56	00:13:03	2	that was one of them i don't know the other one um one may have been not not sort of jewish 
00:13:03	00:13:06	1	uh and arab but just arab 
00:13:06	00:13:12	2	because i remember them saying something a letter to her or what but it was in the galley i mean saying what a good thing 
00:13:12	00:13:14	1	it could be for a jewish 
00:13:14	00:13:23	2	and to be you know in a circumstance like this survey would realize that jews actually you know have an interest and and i think that was something involving 
00:13:23	00:13:25	1	kids but i'm not sure <unk> 
00:13:25	00:13:38	2	mhm um and then the other one i think and i don't know if the other one was raised or not i think that was the one that had to do with um [noise] a daycare center which has for both um it's not actually very 
00:13:38	00:13:40	1	i could be very hard but 
00:13:40	00:13:46	2	care center for jewish and arab kids and it was outside of either hi far tel aviv i don't remember which one 
00:13:56	00:14:01	1	and but the second goal of this thing is to increase sort of coexistence 
00:14:01	00:14:09	2	you know among these groups and marry him as more interested in the second goal and i mean the first call i mean it's something i think she could be interested in but i think emotion that can be 
00:14:14	00:14:19	2	um you know they may be abused and maybe you know who knows what's yeah um but i think 
00:14:19	00:14:21	1	possibilities too and i think 
00:14:21	00:14:33	2	um you know what they said basically to her and they sounded very positive and i looked at some of the letters or emails that she'd gotten from them they sounded really positive and like they were sure they would find something for her it's just they don't make any permanent assignments until the 
00:14:33	00:14:35	1	person 
00:14:35	00:14:37	2	it's with the people from that group 
00:14:37	00:14:41	1	<unk> i mean we're still when she comes arrives what does she have to do what 
00:14:41	00:14:47	2	well she's gonna at some point i mean she'll have to be in contact more of these people and shut deal and i guess set up some meetings with these groups that they think 
00:14:47	00:14:49	1	his <unk> you know 
00:14:49	00:14:52	2	no i don't know where they are headquartered [noise] um it might be dangerous 
00:14:52	00:14:53	1	but i'm not sure 
00:14:53	00:14:56	2	mhm um but you know they're like sort of uh 
00:14:56	00:14:59	1	nader brawl organization or something 
00:14:59	00:15:06	2	uh pose as soon as she gets in the first thing it's a meat and try to make phone calls i've gotten to a room from the keyboards for two or three 
00:15:06	00:15:08	1	mhm mhm 
00:15:08	00:15:11	2	i could probably extended look at she could also we stay on our couch 
00:15:11	00:15:13	1	it's not that 
00:15:13	00:15:19	2	it's not as convenient but you know yeah well i mean i think she'd like to arrange things you know pretty much as soon as you can i mean i think that 
00:15:19	00:15:22	1	just to unwind exactly but 
00:15:23	00:15:27	1	working on it and and some of them talked to some of these opportunities i'm they faxed or a bunch of 
00:15:27	00:15:29	2	how far are emailed her a bunch of stuff 
00:15:29	00:15:32	1	that some of these things provide housing in an absorb 
00:15:32	00:15:43	2	<unk> some provide housing in a village which i told her to be real careful about the traditional arab village i don't think she wants to stay there i mean live there i think it would make it very <unk> 
00:15:43	00:15:44	1	for her to have a social life 
00:15:44	00:15:51	2	yeah that's true too i mean like after eight o'clock she couldn't be out and she couldn't be seen with a man who was not you know are blood relatives 
00:15:51	00:15:54	1	recently got a check not all those are like well that's true 
00:15:54	00:16:02	2	that's true i mean i'm <unk> i know the one that do you remember low why yeah i mean his village apparently was quite traditional mhm um but maybe 
00:16:04	00:16:22	2	he would not visit her the last time because i remember that if he's married now maybe he can i don't know yeah or maybe with his wife he goes out the one thing for sure is like is she is what i'm sort of guessing is that <unk> um <unk> is very close to where david lives it's like a half an hour 
00:16:22	00:16:24	1	we didn't know that yeah 
00:16:24	00:16:27	2	maybe forty minutes uh-huh i would guess and i'm david 
00:16:27	00:16:29	1	a lot of friends there 
00:16:29	00:16:38	2	<unk> and some people who works with testing is that if <unk> you know if it doesn't work otherwise with david 
00:16:38	00:16:50	1	mhm they could probably go together and visit you know to you know when <unk> when she was coming not come in the female on her own mhm mhm <unk> list her cousin or a male cousin i'm i'm guessing that's 
00:16:50	00:16:56	2	oh i think that would probably be fine yeah yeah i mean it's just like on chaperones the problem 
00:16:56	00:16:58	1	it's something like that i'm guessing 
00:16:58	00:17:00	2	play like i make things easier huh 
00:17:08	00:17:17	2	yeah yeah i mean i think she would really like to see him and you know he was very sweet and you sort of one of these things that she sort of felt like she came up against the cultural wall i mean she sort of understand 
00:17:18	00:17:26	2	i guess intellectually understood but emotionally didn't understand [laughter] yeah um which i think you know she'll probably have a lot of those kinds of experiences 
00:17:26	00:17:28	1	um i have um 
00:17:28	00:17:33	2	but did you send boxes um yes just three 
00:17:33	00:17:36	1	um by <unk> you know surf she spent what 
00:17:36	00:17:41	2	to her care of me er yeah yes one is books and the others are you close 
00:17:41	00:17:49	1	mhm mhm so i mean i don't know whatever i don't know whatever forms you know she had to fill out for it but she did the right things and there's there's nothing new in their <unk> 
00:17:49	00:17:53	2	be and it's too <unk> no wonder what that means it's becoming pardon 
00:17:53	00:17:56	1	did she get any special visas or just whatever no 
00:17:56	00:18:18	2	think they said i mean she talked to them and whatever i mean she did whatever they told her first oh i know i think she talked to the counseling first they said yes she needed one then they said no she actually could get one in israel uh-huh uh-huh um so she just listen to what i mean she had gotten to know the <unk> in um [noise] um i know in in ah michigan <unk> and and talked with them talk with him something just 
00:18:18	00:18:26	1	did whatever he ended up thing mhm so um and she called me poor marry him called me yesterday morning i mean she had a great time she hadn't called 
00:18:26	00:18:33	2	<unk> well yes now she is but i've been watching the weather friends it looks like she had very nice warm weather and friends the whole time 
00:18:33	00:18:41	1	yeah i think so i mean she just spoke very very briefly but she said she had a really nice time but she decided um her friend didn't have time to meet her in the mountains 
00:18:41	00:18:52	2	spanish is going to go right to madrid it was going to be an all night um train ride and then she found out playing costs the same thing so she decided to go by plane but she called me very distraught from the airport because i told her is gonna be two hundred dollars 
00:18:52	00:18:56	1	extra for her luggage because with in europe i mean everybody 
00:18:56	00:18:58	2	told her like if you she flew directly to israel 
00:18:58	00:19:00	1	from the states 
00:19:00	00:19:06	2	she was allowed seventy kilos because you like in europe she was only allowed forty <unk> then they told her within europe was only twenty 
00:19:06	00:19:07	1	<unk> 
00:19:07	00:19:12	2	so she was like er twenty keel she was like twenty <unk> over and and i just didn't know what the 
00:19:12	00:19:14	1	do i mean 
00:19:14	00:19:20	2	she hadn't originally planned to fly you know just i guess it has to do with like this common market stuff now or whatever but 
00:19:25	00:19:37	2	see and then i told her to beg and cry and find some nice young man and smile at him and cried the say she doesn't have the money i mean ultimately you know ten years from now we'll make a difference but that's a huge amount of money 
00:19:37	00:19:43	1	well that's that actually happened to me many years ago when i flew back home british airways oh wow 
00:19:43	00:19:56	2	air france who told her was going to be all this extra thing um and you know nobody i i haven't heard from her since then but nobody was even out her gay and you know this one guy said well he said i can not five <unk> off the weight and i told her let's put on your 
00:19:56	00:20:02	1	and take your toiletries out you know anything that's heavy put them in your backpack but still she was just so 
00:20:02	00:20:12	2	i mean she just had no idea and she couldn't mail anything at that point because i guess because of terrorism fears they um have um you can only males 
00:20:12	00:20:16	1	from the post office at the airport wait so she's got what she's what forty q 
00:20:16	00:20:20	2	mhm uh-huh yeah but she was really 
00:20:20	00:20:22	1	but <unk> he killed and i'm forty pounds no forty 
00:20:22	00:20:25	2	<unk> mhm no it was i mean it's too big 
00:20:25	00:20:27	1	full bag and us off 
00:20:27	00:20:42	2	suitcase which are pretty big but she couldn't you know fairly much manage it but and then i think it's probably a little less by now because she was giving a couple of things to her friend in paris but you know makes you bought something you know the problem when she was already at the airport otherwise you would have males things or maybe she would have gone back to the trains 
00:20:48	00:21:06	2	the person actually the person she's visiting in um <unk> who she visited in paris is a friend of hers from ann arbor i mean who she knew in in our but but she's actually a german young woman who's starting graduate school in paris [laughter] um and i remember meeting her what's her name was so few she's very nice and the other person um 
00:21:06	00:21:09	1	in spain for a guy she was visiting who 
00:21:09	00:21:18	2	um it's it's not i mean he has a girlfriend he's gonna she's going to stay with his family but he's um [noise] he spent two years in this country um and went to her high school then 
00:21:18	00:21:21	1	as far as the doctor and she kept up 
00:21:21	00:21:35	2	no telephone and writing communication now for nine years oh let me systems high school yeah yeah oh that's neat they've never seen each other since then oh that's neat yeah yeah so she was excited about that has that i remember meeting his mother wants who seem very nice 
00:21:35	00:21:35	1	mhm 
00:21:35	00:21:38	2	oh that's nice yeah yeah i mean she did have 
00:21:38	00:21:43	1	so upset about the the baggage stuff but she did say she had a great time in paris so i had about that 
00:21:43	00:21:45	2	and 
00:21:45	00:21:47	1	um and i just had uh 
00:21:47	00:21:53	2	um i mean i'm fine but somebody hit my car to feel badly and it had to be total way 
00:21:53	00:21:55	1	john they take it 
00:21:55	00:22:04	2	the other person but they said sort of it was close you know trying to tell who was leibel and i think he's gonna contestants so that's going to be a pain [laughter] what happened 
00:22:04	00:22:08	1	well i was at uh it was an area where they're like these two lanes 
00:22:08	00:22:24	2	<unk> and i was trying to turn left and i had stopped i was sort of entering a street and then almost immediately thereafter turning left and um i had stopped there was nobody coming i had pulled into the the term lying had my turn signal on was going very very slowly and he 
00:22:24	00:22:27	1	pass me he came from behind me and passed me on the list 
00:22:27	00:22:31	2	and drove into me as i was turning but he said 
00:22:31	00:22:32	1	and you know either 
00:22:38	00:22:59	2	i i just don't know i mean it just it's just very hard to tell from it was dark and it's just very hard to i had to move my car out of the street because i was so afraid somebody else would come along and hit you know what hit me 'cause it's kind of an intersection where you you sort of come around the bend before you get to this <unk> um i think he was somewhat over in the left hand in the wrong lane by the time he hit me but 
00:22:59	00:23:03	1	that i just cut in front of him which i did not do 
00:23:03	00:23:27	2	may not have been a hundred percent in the turn line because i had come you know from the right and then you know had merged in from the right and there was almost immediately turning left but i know that i was not i mean i was at least you know i think i was at least half and probably more in the passing lane because before i pulled my car at the street cars were going by me on the right hand side so i know i was not in the right wing 
00:23:27	00:23:28	1	yeah 
00:23:28	00:23:35	2	but it's kind of a mess [laughter] and a lot of damage in the car yeah yeah i think so i mean i don't 
00:23:35	00:23:38	1	and to you know into your side where you are in the car 
00:23:38	00:23:53	2	oh yeah yeah but uh fortunately it was a little farther ahead than the where the drivers seat is it was like the front wheel and the front um like the bumper and stuff was torn often you know wires were hanging out but 
00:23:53	00:23:55	1	it may be more cosmetics 
00:23:55	00:24:08	2	[noise] i mean you know i'm it's obviously a lot of body work but it's possible it didn't affect the engine and i don't think it bent anything but i can't tell because my daughter was able to open and closed fine i think if it had sort of bent the car structurally i probably would have had trouble 
00:24:08	00:24:10	1	closing the door 
00:24:10	00:24:20	2	but you know my cars so new that one of the things that happens in this country is you can end up fighting with an insurance company even if they accept liability and pay they may want you to go to some new name junkie 
00:24:20	00:24:21	1	to fix it 
00:24:21	00:24:27	2	you know wouldn't do a good job and it really old car that'd be one thing but a car that plan to keep you know like nine more years 
00:24:27	00:24:29	1	to do the job on 
00:24:29	00:24:37	2	so that's a pain [laughter] i didn't tell marry him that have happened the night before and i just thought yeah i don't need to tell her that [laughter] and i really am fine 
00:24:37	00:24:41	1	notice hurt but it was kinda yucky 
00:24:41	00:24:44	2	yeah yeah but otherwise i'm doing so [laughter] 
00:24:44	00:24:44	1	uh-huh 
00:24:44	00:24:56	2	oh <unk> how are the kids on the general <unk> what'd you think is a good miriam this whole business of how we're going to be meeting exactly yeah it's still i mean i don't i can't similar do however flight number 
00:24:56	00:24:57	1	yeah 
00:25:10	00:25:13	1	um <unk> 
00:25:13	00:25:16	2	yeah oh two or twenty fourth flight 
00:25:16	00:25:22	1	three seven nine six seven <unk> supposed to be coming in the i think it's 
00:25:22	00:25:32	2	right oh let's see arrived tel aviv [noise] sixteen oh five is that <unk> [laughter] i don't i don't think in those terms 
00:25:32	00:25:36	1	yeah okay because um the whole thing is 
00:25:36	00:25:43	2	so a lot of depends on whether her plane is coming in on time or not 'cause i'm <unk> i'm flying to tel aviv right and i will 
00:25:43	00:25:44	1	reaching 
00:25:44	00:25:50	2	<unk> not that been growing airport the other <unk> i'm coming in at four 
00:25:50	00:25:55	1	thirty now there's a there's an <unk> airport buses there's one at four 
00:25:55	00:26:05	2	forty five at five thirty i don't think i'll make the four forty five mhm now five thirty already i mean means i'm at the airport a quarter six which means she maybe 
00:26:07	00:26:10	2	for forty five thirty 
00:26:10	00:26:13	1	i can tell she was having to go through customs like i know she 
00:26:13	00:26:26	2	do it and make the <unk> and we're only make the five thirty right right so the question is what i do i go to <unk> you know it seems to make more sense than for her to just come out on that bus and i will weight but i'm not you know i told 
00:26:26	00:26:29	1	try to call i wasn't there 
00:26:29	00:26:34	2	so the factory or <unk> you know i don't know you know <unk> it's a problem how we're going to be able to 
00:26:34	00:26:36	1	yeah i mean she definitely supposed to 
00:26:36	00:26:39	2	oh wow i didn't think titled or mm 
00:26:39	00:26:42	1	okay 'cause i think i've spoken to after 
00:26:42	00:26:50	2	she had spoken to you and i thought it's just like if it was like some change or you should do is going to be late or something so i'm not sure if she's planning to call 
00:26:57	00:27:11	2	yeah yeah right but do you want me to i mean i could pay you back for it although um i don't think she could call you well easily but i have the number where she's staying in spain and their parents his parents know english 
00:27:11	00:27:14	1	oh so you don't maybe i could do it and just tell her was exactly one 
00:27:14	00:27:16	2	yeah yeah 
00:27:16	00:27:23	1	because i told her that i will if <unk> you know for not there i was sort of thing that then i'll you know wait for <unk> for when did you get you know give them 
00:27:23	00:27:32	2	number then okay their last name is postal p. o. t. o. p. p. o. v. o. okay um his first name is <unk> 
00:27:41	00:27:45	1	their phone number is well zero one one um 
00:27:52	00:27:55	1	one eight nine eight <unk> yeah and that's in madrid 
00:27:55	00:27:58	2	there's no <unk> [laughter] you know 
00:27:58	00:28:02	1	right i mean i don't know yeah i mean he is a doctor um 
00:28:02	00:28:07	2	you know it's possible he does but <unk> doesn't know that if he does 
00:28:14	00:28:18	1	but that one is sort of international type calling card thing um 
00:28:18	00:28:29	2	oh she did um but it's like unbelievably expensive really yeah it's like two dollars a minute um 
00:28:29	00:28:31	1	that's what i do normally 
00:28:31	00:28:32	2	really wow 
00:28:32	00:28:36	1	well i <unk> i think i pay five dollars for three minutes or something 
00:28:36	00:28:48	2	oh well that yeah well that's that's <unk> i mean i pay here anywhere between one and two dollars and it depending on the time of day but when it's a good time which i almost never call on it's only a dollar a minute 
00:28:48	00:28:51	1	uh-huh um <unk> 
00:28:51	00:29:05	2	i mean that might be good to try and just directly you know tell her that yeah 'cause he's a little bit anxious to about you know what happens if you know we both thought of what happens if you eat on a bus going the opposite direction [laughter] which is not be good if you 
00:29:07	00:29:09	2	i mean it seems like almost because like 
00:29:12	00:29:20	2	the four forty five but then there's no problem 'cause i'll be there would be for her mhm i'd be like five mhm and there's no way she'll make before 
00:29:20	00:29:24	1	five butts right now i mean she's also 
00:29:24	00:29:35	2	she could not make the five so that's a sort of things i can <unk> um <unk> see i don't even notice anybody could pager 'cause like when i came back it took me almost three hours to get out of the 
00:29:35	00:29:38	1	<unk> oh god it was 
00:29:38	00:29:39	2	landed together

00:29:58	00:30:00	1	probably even though so kind of work
