00:01:08	00:01:11	2	and uh yeah we did that all day and 
00:01:11	00:01:14	1	i'm waiting to hear from um 
00:01:14	00:01:27	2	sacramento state in san jose state about their programs are so basically i think it was i wrote you were trying to decide between like san diego area sacramento and silicone valley like you know live near santa cruz mountains 
00:01:27	00:01:30	1	been <unk> somewhere felt in somewhere like that yeah 
00:01:30	00:01:36	2	oh neat three different choices well that's what i'd like i'm glad glad to see it back in california that would be nice 
00:01:36	00:01:45	1	me too so it's really hard to decide though i mean like he says that he could probably get a job anywhere and i hope he's right and so i don't know 
00:01:45	00:01:49	2	where i would prefer to live i guess part of it's based on school stuff but 
00:01:49	00:01:50	1	mhm 
00:01:50	00:01:54	2	you know i might not find out about a school until he's already got a job 
00:01:54	00:01:56	1	oh yeah 
00:01:56	00:02:05	2	uh you know trying to think about where would i really don't want to live like we were thinking of living in the foothills of the sierras in commuting to sacramento 
00:02:05	00:02:09	1	i kind of er we'd have to live in the hills of santa cruz and can you to san jose 
00:02:09	00:02:16	2	similar yeah well anyway you look at it it's gonna be if you want hills and uh college you're going to have to travel yeah every day 
00:02:16	00:02:18	1	yeah 
00:02:18	00:02:24	2	so that's that's what's been really occupying my mind lately and 
00:02:24	00:02:30	1	well i think that's where you got the mobility is going to cost you too you know everyone else wants to do that too 
00:02:30	00:02:31	2	live out in the bunnies and commute 
00:02:31	00:02:32	1	mhm

00:02:34	00:02:36	1	uh-huh 
00:02:36	00:02:39	2	going to go that trouble so well 
00:02:39	00:02:49	1	it said that he could probably get a job or his hours are flexible so that he could um the during non commute hours yeah and if i was in school maybe it would be kind of off

00:07:34	00:07:36	1	a little better but 
00:07:36	00:07:38	2	whole thing with a referendum and 
00:07:38	00:07:43	1	[noise] so there's a small town kind of feeling here people are sort of more conservative 
00:07:43	00:07:52	2	i uh i gather that they're not that crazy the can fish 'cause you're not that crazy about english speaking people 
00:07:52	00:07:57	1	[noise] is that true or there's a lot of discrimination if you don't speak french and are you not french canadian 
00:07:57	00:08:12	2	[laughter] ah what's the other way around you know for for years that <unk> that mean english have more power here there are a minority but they have more money and stuff and for years it was an against the law to speak french at work even though there was a <unk> majority 
00:08:12	00:08:13	1	really 
00:08:13	00:08:17	2	define through an english in the fifties sixties and early seventies 
00:08:17	00:08:18	1	oh some of the 
00:08:18	00:08:33	2	and and and french rich <unk> the french canadians who called the white makers i mean they're treated like shit really yeah and that's that's where all this history of all the stealing is bill how is this is this kind of like northern ireland then like yeah like that 
00:08:33	00:08:34	1	oh wow 
00:08:34	00:08:41	2	you know an east grew up in that and and he refused to speak english because of that until he moved to los angeles 
00:08:41	00:08:42	1	oh and 
00:08:42	00:08:46	2	so there's been an uh referendum in the past and then um 
00:08:46	00:08:48	1	the french canadians you know there were too scared 
00:08:48	00:09:02	2	they voted no and they thought there would be always constitutional changes that then they got screwed by the government they they totally backed down on all the changes they were going to make and made things even harder for <unk> french canadians so that's why they 
00:09:02	00:09:04	1	even with these referendum 
00:09:04	00:09:17	2	[noise] you know but still people are too scared but like overall like english infringe they get along i mean they're polite to each other mhm like canadians are [noise] but there's <unk> like on the talk shows there's all this anger 
00:09:17	00:09:21	1	on both sides well kind of like the blacks and whites there 
00:09:21	00:09:23	2	no no but yeah but uh 
00:09:23	00:09:28	1	you know in face to face it uh you know for white as a rule but 
00:09:28	00:09:33	2	mhm but you know there's not as much violence here as in the u._s. yeah 
00:09:33	00:09:35	1	so yeah there's all this stuff 
00:09:51	00:09:52	1	any way it'd be glad to get back 
00:09:52	00:10:00	2	[noise] yeah like whenever i went to the u._s. i feel the sense of relief [laughter] you know like i want to hear u._s. news and 
00:10:00	00:10:03	1	i mean we talked about that you with mexico i think it said the same thing 
00:10:03	00:10:06	2	just crossing the border you take huh i'm home [laughter] 
00:10:06	00:10:09	1	it was like economically things are so much better and 
00:10:09	00:10:17	2	the u. s. like we went to vermont and we went to burlington which is such a lovely town it was so happy to be there and he's great restaurants and all these neat 
00:10:17	00:10:18	1	tops 
00:10:18	00:10:22	2	it's really great place you're i'm sure you'll see it <unk> yeah yeah 
00:10:31	00:10:34	2	yeah you do that so 
00:10:34	00:10:35	1	maybe i could do that 
00:10:35	00:10:36	2	[laughter] 
00:10:36	00:10:38	1	oh yeah 
00:10:38	00:10:46	2	so it was really you know it was different because near the border into canada everything starts getting really small and houses are small businesses are all tiny and 
00:10:46	00:10:49	1	oh yeah so 
00:10:49	00:10:52	2	we came down through the same town called <unk> broke 
00:10:52	00:10:53	1	mhm 
00:10:53	00:11:00	2	<unk> sure sure yeah i know if it came through there is some my knee or something as i recall uh-huh 
00:11:00	00:11:02	1	yeah i haven't been there 
00:11:02	00:11:11	2	yeah it's pretty much beautiful yeah so so anyway how are you oh good is kind of up and down and 
00:11:19	00:11:24	2	i'm trying to be nicer to her and it seems to be working 'cause you know i find that it's really <unk> 
00:11:24	00:11:28	1	<unk> when i moved in here in the middle of september it was 
00:11:45	00:11:49	1	here so [noise] uh i 
00:11:49	00:11:51	2	trying to um 
00:11:51	00:11:53	1	act a little better and uh 
00:11:53	00:12:03	2	i have an acting a little better [laughter] it's amazing how resentful i um my for when she wants to do something i was like wow you know and i usually do it but 
00:12:03	00:12:04	1	uh she does 
00:12:04	00:12:08	2	really ask for much she really doesn't and i could certainly be a lot nicer and it's still not 
00:12:08	00:12:11	1	break my back over anything 
00:12:11	00:12:21	2	so um that's been improving my my attitudes than improving their and then the <unk> you know with jerry's um [noise]

00:13:41	00:13:42	1	i haven't really 
00:13:42	00:13:44	2	been in a market for it 
00:13:44	00:13:46	1	till now 
00:13:46	00:13:55	2	um and i i wouldn't know how to go about getting it either it's just that hey i think i'm ready for it or just oh [laughter] interesting [laughter] 
00:13:55	00:13:58	1	sort of hit me too when i i told you about 
00:13:58	00:14:05	2	realizing that tutor tutoring is not very stable and i don't enjoy it that much any more it's okay but that's why i think i i'm going to go back to 
00:14:05	00:14:08	1	school you're ready for stability too 
00:14:08	00:14:18	2	yeah i mean i want to have a profession that i can use you know and get a job and have a practice and that i would enjoy more 
00:14:18	00:14:22	1	and uh you know i think about marrying even 
00:14:22	00:14:25	2	if i wanted to i could just be a housewife 
00:14:25	00:14:28	1	he's going to make a lot of money and everything but that doesn't make me feel too 
00:14:28	00:14:30	2	mhm 
00:14:30	00:14:34	1	so um you know i want to go back to school and now that i guess 
00:14:34	00:14:44	2	yeah it's nice though to have a man who would allow you that option [laughter] there are men out there who will not be happy in till you're learning you know you're 
00:14:44	00:14:49	1	it's as if they don't if you know if you know i'm trying to say yeah 
00:14:59	00:15:09	1	[noise] but um one thing i was gonna ask you about was like you were getting all excited about doing financial planning and lose that have you thought about going to school and doing that 
00:15:09	00:15:13	2	well i haven't gotten too far on that i um 
00:15:13	00:15:16	1	took a little three session course at the local 
00:15:16	00:15:28	2	you know adult school on financial planning and uh uh financial planner did the class and i says how did you get to be that and he says we took a class is basically says you there's a little 
00:15:28	00:15:31	1	outfit in denver where you can take a correspondence course and be one 
00:15:31	00:15:32	2	but he got 
00:15:32	00:15:35	1	an undergraduate degree in finance 
00:15:35	00:15:39	2	i thought oh that sounds interesting i don't know if i wanted to go that far 
00:15:39	00:15:41	1	[noise] but 
00:15:41	00:15:53	2	i'm just pointing in the direction of learning more about money and i've got a network statement now and it's [noise] i'm <unk> i just is i'm just surprised to learn my network is increasing every month you know 'cause when i count the stuff up that 
00:15:53	00:15:54	1	[noise] 
00:15:54	00:15:56	2	like there's eight hundred and ten dollars every month 
00:15:56	00:15:57	1	mhm 
00:15:57	00:16:10	2	increased equity and the the building wow yeah and a few years ago it was only two hundred a month and and there's that and then um you know saving money through my retirement thing i don't have any income at the dispose 
00:16:24	00:16:30	2	so um [noise] i'm just trying to learn about money and and it's 
00:16:30	00:16:31	1	it's not that hard 
00:16:31	00:16:34	2	[noise] i still don't know about price expense racial 
00:16:34	00:16:37	1	some of the stuff just doesn't compute like 
00:16:37	00:16:40	2	by bonds when interest rates are 
00:16:40	00:16:41	1	coming down 
00:16:41	00:16:44	2	but not always and you know 
00:16:44	00:16:45	1	why is that 
00:16:45	00:16:59	2	and the you know i've had a display numerous times that i still don't quite get it but i will and then you know it's just a slight seems to be all about mastery right now just uh [noise] when computers and riding a bicycle and reading about money and stuff 
00:16:59	00:17:02	1	[noise] huh so 
00:17:02	00:17:07	2	um i i feel pretty good this thing with jerry <unk> it's made me upset us i guess mostly i just being myself 
00:17:07	00:17:10	1	well here's another relationship 
00:17:10	00:17:17	2	but you know [laughter] i never did take him seriously as a marriage partner after the first month or two and 
00:17:17	00:17:20	1	but i was comfortable and i enjoyed being 
00:17:20	00:17:30	2	um for the most part although the circumstances of change now he just he's standing on the shrinking iceberg talking about as big plans you know he's probably going to end up living with 
00:17:30	00:17:33	1	mother like me but 
00:17:35	00:17:44	1	so does he like you say it's over but does he know that oh have you talked about it or is he like sort of assuming that you're just gonna always be there we can 
00:17:44	00:17:52	2	oh out you know was indefinitely as far as i'm concerned but i have no plans to be with them for the future i don't have any plans or not 
00:17:52	00:17:53	1	be with him either 
00:17:53	00:17:57	2	but i don't know if he's gonna get bummed out by this 
00:17:57	00:17:58	1	four he's 
00:17:58	00:18:04	2	so the other day in that one is and and kind of a crappy moody says he wants all or nothing in a relationship 
00:18:06	00:18:27	2	iffy presses it then i guess i'll have to say it will be nothing and i've never been terribly involved in his financial problems but i find i do things that i'm gonna try stopping like i i'm afraid of being alone and so i asked him if he wanted to go to this age 
00:18:27	00:18:28	1	quit and i i 
00:18:28	00:18:37	2	told my biased ticket you know and i really hate it ought to buy his own damn ticket and there's no reason why i should buy it but i just wanted to make sure he'd go 
00:18:37	00:18:38	1	mhm 
00:18:44	00:18:48	1	well that's the thing the thing about being alone i mean it is hard 
00:18:48	00:18:50	2	it is hard it's been alone 
00:18:50	00:18:52	1	yeah
