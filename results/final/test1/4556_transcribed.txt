00:20:19	00:20:34	2	have been communicating by letter and take sounds like she's in pretty bad shape that she does a lot of sleeping which is good for him and she um you know doing the same things over and over i saw them this winter we were there a couple of times 
00:20:34	00:20:35	1	yeah 
00:20:59	00:21:01	1	continues i don't know 
00:21:01	00:21:06	2	i feel sorry i'm i'm not going to visit i was going to see them in october except in the same weekend 
00:21:06	00:21:15	1	we're going to get down there this when we have made me aware plans yet and i'm kind of thinking of maybe taking an apartment in spain for either for six weeks [laughter] 
00:21:15	00:21:22	2	done that yet and people have done that so i keep thinking florida is going to be there all the time so he was good 
00:21:22	00:21:24	1	maine oh my 
00:21:24	00:21:35	2	okay so i've got to start looking into it a lot of people i know have done it i uh we were i didn't we didn't really spend any time on the coast down there but i love to spain 
00:21:35	00:21:45	1	you didn't really think that i would go to where they take the apartments is like costa del sol and i thought just from there we take different trips 
00:21:45	00:21:51	2	[noise] we did too much traveling around when we were in costa rica's so we decided next time we go to one place 
00:21:51	00:21:54	1	yeah oh i really wanted some day i want to get 
00:21:54	00:22:12	2	the details of what you do as i said before it was mostly a wild life you know in nature trip and a lot of bird watching riding around in boats and saw volcanoes and just a couple of days at the beaches but it was fun it was too much traveling for us we went to that 
00:22:12	00:22:14	1	six different 
00:22:14	00:22:23	2	seventeen days it was just too much but it was my phone because i wanted to see the country and that we did yeah that's a lot of coffee plantations 
00:22:36	00:22:38	1	we didn't um 
00:22:38	00:22:39	2	that's kinda 
00:22:39	00:22:42	1	<unk> that was business but we didn't really have to 
00:22:42	00:22:48	2	um no we have rented a house and now we've rented it again for a year from 
00:22:48	00:22:55	1	from september actually we had rented a house in <unk> uh-huh and we were going to go with toby and jerry and then jerry 
00:22:55	00:23:07	2	was offered to go on staff um for murder she wrote and it's it's just too and they said but you <unk> you can't leave town until you know i don't know when 
00:23:07	00:23:10	1	enough i guess and um 
00:23:10	00:23:12	2	'cause they had to get the season ready or whatever it is and 
00:23:12	00:23:15	1	so he you know it was too good a thing to do 
00:23:15	00:23:25	2	before he he could technically sort of retire uh-huh um and this year that years worth of income would certainly be a terrific so we're we cancel it and it's 
00:23:25	00:23:28	1	friend of ours actually took the <unk> taking the house 
00:23:28	00:23:37	2	and said it was fabulous so if ever you want to form hill oh is that all the time of year to go that's when we've been there yeah 
00:23:37	00:23:39	1	and then it's just you know it's it's an old 
00:23:39	00:23:47	2	farmhouse it's been remodel about eight people can fit in it but it's really like two apartments mhm and it's on acres and acres and acres in 
00:23:47	00:23:51	1	here's the farm and but it's not far from 
00:23:51	00:23:57	2	it's near the line of tough skinny and it's um not far from russia and at least be and 
00:23:57	00:23:59	1	yeah it seems like it's so 
00:23:59	00:24:05	2	<unk> yeah and in january we had these two plans for this year but both of them 
00:24:05	00:24:07	1	and we were going to go to the <unk> 
00:24:07	00:24:14	2	in december and then so that's something like what we did this costa rica trip with that kind of a thing 
00:24:14	00:24:18	1	oh yeah we're on a boat aren't you and you're just yeah and all of the 
00:24:18	00:24:26	2	yeah yeah and you go visiting you sail at night it's a small <unk> yeah i mean it only has like seven cabins yeah 
00:24:30	00:24:39	2	i've looked at some of those trips it sounded interesting after having done costa rica i don't think i want to do that one [laughter] it sounds very similar to what we were doing 
00:24:39	00:24:42	1	yeah i it may be more wrestle because you basically 
00:24:42	00:24:52	2	<unk> which is nice if i were to ask you a costa rica again i would do it on a boat they had another trip that sounded interesting but i wanted to see more 
00:24:52	00:24:56	1	that's how everyone learns yeah i have to tell you 
00:24:56	00:25:02	2	with a project she had to do in costa rica when stuff some benefit [laughter] 
00:25:04	00:25:06	2	my dad an article i saw in the 
00:25:09	00:25:10	1	jews 
00:25:10	00:25:24	2	that the original people a huge amount of the original people in jamaica i had been jewish and that um because they were at some kind of a barbecue or something the people who wrote this and they said okay these 
00:25:24	00:25:26	1	things were slaughtered in the <unk> [laughter] 
00:25:26	00:25:28	2	and and they said 
00:25:28	00:25:30	1	oh sure and it turned out [noise] 
00:25:30	00:25:34	2	oh i'm sorry i didn't xerox interested anymore i'm an accountant 
00:25:44	00:25:50	1	for the big five hundredth anniversary of the dog where his family also

00:26:14	00:26:15	1	um but he 
00:26:15	00:26:20	2	uh that's where his family was and i i assume that they left 
00:26:22	00:26:35	2	that's that one's has happened to a lot of the south american jews some very large groups in columbia in mexico and you know a lot of them came from eastern europe but [laughter] 
00:26:35	00:26:38	1	i like it i think when you go there when we 
00:26:49	00:26:51	2	manual antonio yeah 
00:26:51	00:26:55	1	and then the next time we really slow if we just loved that beach
