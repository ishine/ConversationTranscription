00:03:14	00:03:17	1	oh and i don't remember him telling me that he saw you 
00:03:17	00:03:22	2	he probably space that he was i think he was in the middle of some kind of work project or something 
00:03:22	00:03:24	1	picking up people from peace corps probably 
00:03:24	00:03:26	2	yeah yeah 
00:03:26	00:03:27	1	but huh 
00:03:27	00:03:35	2	it was right out i mean that's a long time ago that was right after the um the change of the government and we were down because of that 
00:03:38	00:03:49	2	so it's three boys bar yeah wow my hands and yeah i remember you said last time that the doctor said that you had to have a baby because of your ovaries or whatever just to keep everything in order 
00:03:49	00:03:50	1	right <unk> 
00:03:50	00:03:52	2	yeah they should do it you know 
00:03:52	00:03:53	1	oh that's what it was 
00:03:53	00:04:12	2	me he said that we don't want you to have a baby if it's gonna create problems but if you want to have when this is a time and it actually did turn everything around for me i don't know if it works that way for everybody but those hormones kind of took care of the problems i was having i was starting to have a problem again before like it's only maybe 
00:04:12	00:04:12	1	mhm 
00:04:21	00:04:23	1	and really oh yeah 
00:04:23	00:04:33	2	and then breastfeeding those hormones also help so i feel just fine i hope i hope i never have to deal with enemy true again but who knows [laughter] after three major threat 
00:04:33	00:04:35	1	[laughter] so you're first boy is 
00:04:35	00:04:41	2	oh no no no no no and he's not on and a half that's how long ago that was 
00:04:41	00:04:49	1	and uh we haven't seen each others yeah in a long time because on your other two boys um 
00:04:49	00:04:58	2	thomas is three uh-huh <unk> and then i have a baby who's just going to turn ten months 
00:05:03	00:05:05	1	oh oh how nice 
00:05:20	00:05:23	1	[laughter] i was really so 
00:05:23	00:05:35	2	i was so angry at us good that i just knew there was no way i could ever even think of going to bed with us you know [laughter] whatever [laughter] 
00:05:35	00:05:39	1	i love my little baby yeah yeah 
00:05:52	00:05:56	2	pops in every once in a while but it's tough it really is 
00:05:56	00:06:00	1	wow i didn't lose you too she does 
00:06:00	00:06:17	2	has since well i think they've been here five years now five years this summer 'cause we were figuring that they could apply for citizenship both are certainly here um he has more money and she just turned eighteen now he doesn't live here 
00:06:17	00:06:18	1	um 
00:06:18	00:06:20	2	he had caught up 
00:06:20	00:06:24	1	well it's a it's a long long story but um 
00:06:24	00:06:33	2	at one point when i got real irritated with <unk> everybody in the family insisted that i was an idiot and i should make him take 
00:06:33	00:06:36	1	children which you know i really believe 
00:06:36	00:06:48	2	and i <unk> i mean it does make a lot of intellectual sense i guess but you really i didn't want to do that to the kids that i did and so i sent them to stay with him and then 
00:06:48	00:06:50	1	i felt bad 
00:06:50	00:06:57	2	immediately and then he wouldn't let them come back and so it turned into a situation where 
00:06:57	00:07:05	1	really the one that wanted to come back and ask you a junior kind of um decided that living with his father was what he wanted 
00:07:05	00:07:06	2	and 
00:07:06	00:07:12	1	his mom used to bake him to let her come back and he'd say yes and they hang up the phone either i'd never let you brought that 
00:07:12	00:07:21	2	no it was real time but it wasn't really that he wanted her around but it was just i don't know people do stupid things so 
00:07:21	00:07:23	1	so they're living with him 
00:07:23	00:07:27	2	no um now how long it probably two years ago then 
00:07:27	00:07:32	1	we see now i worked it out where i got power of attorney from her mom 'cause their mom always 
00:07:32	00:07:43	2	custody and she called me one day when there was nobody in the house but her and i drove from god and kinda stole her back to current events right [laughter] 
00:07:43	00:07:45	1	oh my god 
00:07:45	00:07:49	2	that i'd ever do that well it was very exciting actually because 
00:07:49	00:07:50	1	[laughter] 
00:07:50	00:08:14	2	i mean i had to drive like two and a half hours so we you know you didn't know at any moment somebody might be coming home i said get yourself ready i called her when i got to the corner you know it was it was really something and we just pack the car pool i mean there wasn't one into space left and then we just flew out of there we went to the nearest mcdonalds to kind of repack where we can breathe homeless guy in germany and then you know he never said anything about it 
00:08:14	00:08:17	1	you know he 
00:08:17	00:08:20	2	no that he knew she was better off here 
00:08:20	00:08:21	1	she had told me that 
00:08:31	00:08:33	2	you know <unk> 
00:08:33	00:08:37	1	what's he doing and she's studying or did she already graduated high school 
00:08:37	00:08:44	2	she's going to be in her last year of high school uh-huh and she's been with your mom for two months so she'll be coming back tomorrow 
00:08:44	00:08:46	1	um uh-huh so 
00:08:46	00:08:56	2	it's that's that's what we have here and then ask you a junior has in the last year he was he graduated one year ago from high school and he started going to school in missouri 
00:08:56	00:08:59	1	and then 
00:08:59	00:09:10	2	just out of the blue he told me that he and his buddy one to move back to <unk> go to school here which is really surprising and then he was kind of same that living with his father wasn't what he you know kind of had 
00:09:10	00:09:12	1	he's opinion on it has it changed 
00:09:12	00:09:20	2	but they wanna tune in an apartment they didn't want to burden me anymore we're his words but you know i know they weren't they weren't freedom which is 
00:09:20	00:09:24	1	great they're twenty you know so yeah moved in about 
00:09:39	00:09:39	1	mhm 
00:09:39	00:09:46	2	[noise] that that that's kind of in a nuts [laughter] wow things would have been going on 
00:09:46	00:09:51	1	oh that's interesting are you working or are you teaching as well i don't yeah 
00:09:51	00:10:04	2	i let's see when i came back i i taught adult basic education because it was really hard to get a job in home back which probably still that way and i went for my masters in counseling 
00:10:04	00:10:08	1	yeah uh-huh um 
00:10:08	00:10:14	2	actually i was asked to come back and be a counselor at the american school and that was the year i was pregnant with no 
00:10:14	00:10:15	1	and i was really 
00:10:15	00:10:25	2	torn i didn't know what to do but my doctor didn't want me to go back to hunters because i'd been so sick before he felt that i really needed we didn't know how the pregnancy 
00:10:25	00:10:26	1	cool 
00:10:26	00:10:32	2	but i i feel like i really i mean i wasn't really paying that much attention to what he said that that do 
00:10:35	00:10:47	2	and uh let's see what would i i guess i was working part time that you're doing part-time counseling jobs and then that next year i had to well i had one offer that i had to take the other one was 
00:10:47	00:10:48	1	we're waiting for 
00:11:00	00:11:01	1	need to know 
00:11:01	00:11:03	2	because i'm pregnant and i cannot 
00:11:05	00:11:12	2	so i <unk> wish human community college which was what i wanted at the time but ah as it turned out it 
00:11:12	00:11:14	1	we was the best 
00:11:22	00:11:39	2	couple of years after i started there than the high school that's where we hit goes offered me a job again 'cause i knew people there but that was another hearing kind of thinks is exactly what i would have wanted two years earlier but just the timing was kinda bad i felt like i'd be really 
00:11:39	00:11:42	1	um <unk> 
00:11:50	00:11:58	2	i probably would've gotten a little burned out by the gang situation the high school so this is probably better mhm 
00:11:58	00:12:05	1	oh but it's nice administration in ministry of job and the community college that sounds like a good show i'm no 
00:12:05	00:12:07	2	it is you know you can lose your job 
00:12:07	00:12:09	1	but when you're in it 
00:12:09	00:12:15	2	i mean you can the other the faculty encounters are in the union dislike disliking hunter [laughter] 
00:12:15	00:12:17	1	wow really 
00:12:17	00:12:33	2	oh yes and they get you know you just have a lot more power but i knew that when i left that will i i i knew if i was going to do it i was going to do any to change it in fact we have um they've been developing a project with belief 
00:12:33	00:12:36	1	nice to <unk> not quite there 
00:12:36	00:12:41	2	maybe someday i'll get down to believe but for me it almost might be worse to go because i know 
00:12:41	00:12:46	1	but if i'm there i'm going to want to get on an airplane go over to <unk> i'm not going to care about what's going on and building 
00:12:46	00:12:50	2	yeah just an excuse to get that 
00:12:50	00:12:56	1	no that <unk> because she can't keep your mind that close [laughter] 
00:12:56	00:13:00	2	i'll bet you'd be able to put it all in proportion in perspective 
00:13:00	00:13:00	1	mhm 
00:13:07	00:13:12	1	yeah now jackie told me that you're the principal is it alcohol

00:13:26	00:13:28	1	now and so i think i've 
00:13:28	00:13:33	2	proved a little bit over the past five years but i don't i don't know if i'm cut out to be a principal 
00:13:33	00:13:34	1	doing it and i think um 
00:13:34	00:13:36	2	fairly good job but 
00:13:36	00:13:39	1	i don't know i i i don't like it 
00:13:39	00:13:51	2	a lot it's not something i would like to do for another five years [laughter] uh-huh but i'll have to see what i can go into next because i don't know if i want to i'm getting kind of tired of teaching actually so 
00:13:51	00:13:57	1	we'll see you have any option not too many yeah not too many get out of teaching altogether 
00:13:57	00:14:06	2	maybe go work for a i._d. or someplace yeah someplace else i don't know got a masters degree in education [noise] uh-huh but

00:20:28	00:20:31	2	oh whatever yeah [laughter] 
00:20:31	00:20:32	1	that makes it in <unk> 
00:20:32	00:20:54	2	there's <unk> they have it there it's like that it's got to get the hunter isn't there much less developed but um i guess it's just maybe the the physical <unk> being physically closer who knows if some monopolies preventing it [laughter] you know but yeah there was somebody who's in control and believes and they do cause it to cost money to the other entities 
00:20:54	00:21:03	1	uh-huh mhm i hope he has no but they're working on that now so that shouldn't that should be ready to go in the not too distant future 
00:21:03	00:21:13	2	if you get an email address just fax me what you have enough to little notices every once in a while [laughter] 'cause then it's it's so much easier than writing 
00:21:13	00:21:16	1	mhm mhm 
00:21:16	00:21:20	2	gets people fast 
00:21:20	00:21:22	1	so nice hearing from 
00:21:22	00:21:26	2	[noise] now tell me is your family well you said you were in new jersey 
00:21:26	00:21:36	1	yeah my mother was sick my mother had a had a tumor in one of the lobes of her lung and she had that whole lobe removed and 
00:21:36	00:21:38	2	and she <unk> 
00:21:38	00:21:41	1	they didn't need any chemotherapy or any other kind of 
00:21:41	00:21:50	2	you know ah radiation or anything um the doctor said he got the whole thing so we'll see we'll see if she 
00:21:50	00:21:50	1	hope so 
00:21:50	00:21:52	2	she doesn't get it again 
00:21:52	00:21:53	1	mhm 
00:21:53	00:22:06	2	but and my brother's living with my mother and my sister is living out in california she's got two kids did i don't know if you probably didn't know a few years ago i had a a nephew with a brain tumor 
00:22:06	00:22:07	1	mhm 
00:22:07	00:22:14	2	and he died he died when he was five years old he got it when he was like well they detected it when he was like two and a half years 
00:22:14	00:22:15	1	mhm 
00:22:15	00:22:21	2	yeah my my youngest brother is oldest boy he's got he's got two more boys 
00:22:21	00:22:22	1	mhm 
00:22:22	00:22:25	2	yeah that was pretty devastating 
00:22:25	00:22:25	1	mhm 
00:22:25	00:22:35	2	i've had i had a cousin who had brain cancer he lived to be sixteen and that was many many years ago but you know that you carry that lacey for a long time because 
00:22:35	00:22:36	1	yeah 
00:22:36	00:22:38	2	talk about it like 
00:22:38	00:22:39	1	yeah we're used to be you know 
00:22:39	00:22:50	2	that's how my sister in law is yeah she's talking about this about about the little boy all the time and it's only been a year since he died maybe that's part of it yeah 
00:22:50	00:22:57	1	but um she's doing all kinds of volunteer work with different cats organizations and getting involved in 
00:22:57	00:23:00	2	and you know with all of those people still 
00:23:07	00:23:10	1	for to go home well actually i could have 
00:23:10	00:23:21	2	going home but then you know it was would have been a heck of a long ride for somebody to come get me and take me out to where they live in pennsylvania and so i didn't go 
00:23:21	00:23:23	1	right mhm 
00:23:23	00:23:23	2	mhm 
00:23:38	00:23:41	1	it it really isn't a different situation you know 
00:23:41	00:23:49	2	yeah i think you told us that the last time he came down your father had just recently died right like a year before you came down one trip or something 
00:23:49	00:23:51	1	he had died like 
00:23:51	00:23:59	2	couple of months after one of them are before one of my trips cause i remember alice in writing i can't believe he went to her <unk> at christmas and i'm so 
00:23:59	00:24:01	1	[laughter] i guess 
00:24:01	00:24:05	2	cold the emotion why is that didn't even think what you know 
00:24:07	00:24:15	2	but my friend went over and stayed with my mother but she has other children here you know i just didn't think that would make that much difference 
00:24:15	00:24:18	1	yeah you've always been traveling around anyway 
00:24:18	00:24:29	2	yeah that's how i mean i felt like we've been here i just can't bear to stay around it was better for me i'll tell you that i didn't think i wanted to go through christmas here see her suffering so 
00:24:41	00:24:43	1	at any time 
00:24:43	00:24:56	2	could really go awry she's i think he you know she was diabetic and she really has had problems with that this last year but on the outside most people wouldn't know because she's still 
00:24:56	00:24:57	1	[laughter] 
00:24:57	00:25:04	2	maintains a big yard and everything and and looks good but she herself in fact we don't know 
00:25:04	00:25:07	1	she tells us that really um 
00:25:07	00:25:20	2	i think things are kind of just wearing out probably they can't really keep her completely control but i guess the doctors that worried i suppose if you're just was seventy years old this is the way it goes but to her 
00:25:20	00:25:21	1	see that and she reads and 
00:25:21	00:25:26	2	and it's like i don't want to be old i don't wanna you know 
00:25:26	00:25:29	1	so that keeps her young yeah well maybe they 
00:25:29	00:25:39	2	see worried a lot about it 'cause it's kinda like watching your body and i guess i would say i don't know but she inject yourself with insulin and everything 
00:25:39	00:25:49	1	yeah she's that had always and i think she does it about four times a day now but she takes a little little dosages they were trying to find the right 
00:25:49	00:25:50	2	right um 
00:25:50	00:25:51	1	level 
00:25:51	00:26:04	2	and the right kind because of that a lot of stuff does she ended up changing dodgers and went to a really well known specialist that my brother also see 'cause he's off a diabetic and he i asked her we're kind of 
00:26:04	00:26:07	1	we did with her to go to i knew 
00:26:07	00:26:11	2	series of education workshops and she kind of felt like sydney 
00:26:11	00:26:12	1	too but he 
00:26:12	00:26:16	2	they guaranteed heard that a lot of things have changed over the fifteen years or so 
00:26:16	00:26:18	1	and she'd become diabetic 
00:26:18	00:26:22	2	faithfully went like six days i think all day long and 
00:26:22	00:26:25	1	she was real happy that she did i think based 
00:26:25	00:26:31	2	<unk> it just made her feel a little bit more comfortable that what was going on wasn't anything she can worry about 
00:26:31	00:26:32	1	she just had to 
00:26:34	00:26:40	1	some of the dietary stuff had changed they were allowing them to eat things that they wouldn't in the past and 
00:26:40	00:26:47	2	that was nice but still no substitute for the we're the injectable insulin no pills 
00:26:47	00:26:49	1	no she's she's 
00:26:49	00:26:58	2	she's <unk> i don't know if that's the only reason but she's never been able to do pills they had talked to her about having um 
00:26:58	00:27:00	1	some sort of an implant 
00:27:00	00:27:09	2	mhm it in but see this was a few years ago that they talked about that and she just she told me that she goes with that for a younger person 
00:27:09	00:27:15	1	was longer to live and she really didn't want us with it and i can respect that 'cause i know that things so 
00:27:15	00:27:19	2	go perfectly with those kind of thing but mhm 
00:27:19	00:27:22	1	her doctor i guess was thinking that because it 
00:27:22	00:27:35	2	supposedly performs on call or something like that that it might work better for since she's so brutal but <unk> interestingly i've found out that one of the guys i work with is diabetic and he's probably about 
00:27:35	00:27:40	1	oh maybe thirty eight i don't know maybe as early forties 
00:27:40	00:27:51	2	but he's not elderly by any means and he had one of those and he said he made him take it out because it just it wasn't wasn't secure 
00:27:51	00:27:52	1	for him i think 
00:27:52	00:27:56	2	sometimes it would react when it shouldn't 
00:27:56	00:27:57	1	uh-huh 
00:27:57	00:28:10	2	all those a lot easier to use injectable insulin and that's where he's at so i was glad to hear that she didn't do it after he told me that so that was a nightmare for him and he's a teacher i can imagine you know <unk> more than you probably wouldn't happen 
00:28:10	00:28:15	1	in in having your insulin pump topping when you don't eat it too 
00:28:15	00:28:19	2	yeah so vice versa you know 
00:28:19	00:28:21	1	oh he's worked [laughter] 
00:28:25	00:28:34	1	well my kids are not yet so of course my brother became diabetic when he was about twenty five my mother was 
00:28:43	00:28:49	1	to see how things go we my <unk> one of my children 
00:28:49	00:29:06	2	this little guys fall asleep on me love sugar they all do really the baby didn't really care 'cause he hasn't been around a bit thomas i think if he could dream pipe eat cookies and candy <unk> better about living here because i know if we lived in <unk> 
00:29:06	00:29:07	1	so if you ever do 
00:29:17	00:29:32	2	i remember that when i was just home in my brother's house they well there's so many different kinds of juice that you can buy in a supermarket and and and at a good price you know here you can't you have to either make it which takes time or or the pop and that's easier 
00:29:32	00:29:34	1	yeah yeah 
00:29:34	00:29:35	2	mhm 
00:29:35	00:29:36	1	mhm 
00:29:36	00:29:40	2	mhm oh so nice hearing from you 
00:29:40	00:29:48	1	well it's i i'm glad that i made the cause i thought well i i don't know sandy [laughter] do you think this is really goofy but 
00:29:48	00:29:56	2	it's nice no i'm glad you did because i've i've been to i've been making all this past week and thinking and i wanna ask once and i thought no he'd never bring it 
00:29:56	00:29:59	1	you know he he always comes late to class sometimes he doesn't
