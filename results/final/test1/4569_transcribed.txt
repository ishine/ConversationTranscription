00:20:14	00:20:15	1	and now 
00:20:15	00:20:30	2	she had a chance to really see the uh not only the supervisors but a number of the classroom teachers so that they are the ones who have to like the book and then it'll be ordered so it's been quite a process she had to go through the ministry of <unk> 
00:20:30	00:20:31	1	<unk> 
00:20:31	00:20:34	2	and you know it's in our lives in english right

00:20:57	00:21:04	2	mhm and eating well she eats because i'm here to cook and i put it in front of her so she can eat and run back 
00:21:04	00:21:06	1	join a book mhm 
00:21:06	00:21:21	2	so now she's working on a book to the second book which is a easier book it's ah what it is is based on stories that she gathers 
00:21:21	00:21:23	1	ah from the whole world

00:21:59	00:22:10	2	full literature so she gathers these stories many of them are written thirty forty years ago but if they had been written letters say within the last twenty years they have to pay 
00:22:10	00:22:12	1	to get permission to right 
00:22:12	00:22:24	2	you know to use it right what it is is is an anthology mhm so uh uh <unk> she tries to gather from various countries that are representative of the countries these kids 
00:22:24	00:22:28	1	from mhm so it is it's a very hard task
