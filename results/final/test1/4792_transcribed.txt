00:15:44	00:15:49	2	they've they want to go into media you know across the board which is that a lot of work 
00:15:49	00:15:55	1	you know what would you say media you mean like doing a some sort of interactive c._d. or something 
00:15:55	00:16:04	2	uh no one's all types of things you know that that would be one part of it you know some kind of like that but that also be a movie making movies showing 
00:16:11	00:16:23	2	all the big companies not want to get into uh you know media ventures [laughter] because you know whether the money's in the software you know so uh you know the setting up companies on the outside

00:17:13	00:17:14	1	yeah 
00:17:14	00:17:16	2	modern story with that 
00:17:16	00:17:18	1	with with too 
00:17:18	00:17:38	2	this chinese guy was in love with american um chinese guy was love with american boy but he was forced into marrying chinese girl for the benefit of his parents his little controversial for taiwan but it went down here and uh well in that field they did have one american but it's it's amazing when when the american public well not tolerate uh 
00:17:38	00:17:43	2	french or spanish that they will they will go to see a chinese film 
00:17:43	00:17:45	1	he's with 
00:17:45	00:17:57	2	with everybody non caucasian but anyway the result of this is the koreans are uh the korean movie makers are flipping out and oh if we could only get uh the american market and start getting some of those things those ourselves 
00:17:57	00:18:00	1	and uh 
00:18:00	00:18:04	2	oh those long as they don't phones a trap of the formula film 
00:18:04	00:18:08	1	it's the same it's the same result if they had with with um 
00:18:08	00:18:19	2	uh with with <unk> about a winning the nobel prize for literature is just uh if we just translate something from korea and in the english than we can get the price to no end the problem is what he wants to go to
