00:07:49	00:07:51	1	oh what did i talk to since i was in the 
00:08:04	00:08:07	2	i guess i have <unk> 
00:08:16	00:08:19	2	[laughter] yeah isn't the best thing although they say it isn't 
00:08:19	00:08:20	1	mhm 
00:08:20	00:08:25	2	stress cause it's a genetic disorder or whatever but 
00:08:25	00:08:28	1	um 
00:08:28	00:08:29	2	mhm 
00:08:29	00:08:32	1	it doesn't help it either yeah 
00:08:32	00:08:35	2	well they tell you to watch your diet are you on any no 
00:08:35	00:08:38	1	said to do nothing i mean they basically said if 
00:08:38	00:08:44	2	if i know something bothers me than avoid it but there's really nothing they can do as far as 
00:08:44	00:08:46	1	preventative medicine for it 
00:08:46	00:08:50	2	uh and the medicines they used to treat it 
00:08:50	00:09:00	1	are not something they want you to stay on permanently because there's a lot of bad side effects <unk> i guess cancer mainly i don't know he didn't go into all that but 
00:09:00	00:09:03	2	um [noise] 
00:09:03	00:09:05	1	anyway so when i 
00:09:19	00:09:44	2	well 'cause both my mom and my sister have class and they've told my sister [noise] off and on that they had come up with a quite a few new medicine that could really use her 'cause she has you know it for quite a bit and they said there were quite a few things out there that um could <unk> you know easter discomfort you know <unk> it doesn't get rid of it obviously but at least will make her feel a little 
00:09:44	00:09:47	1	better mhm but but 
00:09:47	00:10:02	2	i was thinking i was going to go to the health food store and see what they say as far as and things will take there's so many different kinds of polite is he said he didn't really call it quite as 'cause he says everybody's you know <unk> 
00:10:02	00:10:03	1	a broad range of thing 
00:10:03	00:10:18	2	<unk> <unk> irritable bell disease right and there's inflammatory right which inflammatory as what i have enough to genetic disorder were irritable is just it's more stress related 
00:10:18	00:10:20	1	hi 
00:10:20	00:10:23	2	and not quite as serious because 
00:10:23	00:10:26	1	there's two different kinds of <unk> i guess he said 
00:10:26	00:10:37	2	<unk> is it <unk> and one is um crone <unk> right and he told me within five years i'd probably have 
00:10:37	00:10:43	1	disease well that's what which is better than the other because the other turns into cancer 
00:10:43	00:11:04	2	they they told them that he has <unk> all doctors have uh you know for other things and they said and they talk about his other problems and they'd say well you know that sounds like you've got <unk> without further testing i can't give you a definite diagnosis but that's what it sounds like to me while he won't ever go that's <unk> um he won't ever go 
00:11:04	00:11:06	1	to have their tests done 
00:11:06	00:11:10	2	yeah you know i had to <unk> put that go 
00:11:34	00:11:34	1	mhm 
00:11:34	00:11:37	2	not very good at all well 
00:11:37	00:11:41	1	cousins husband was in the hospital over christmas and he just 
00:11:41	00:11:42	2	just a couple of days before chris 
00:11:42	00:11:44	1	um with 
00:11:44	00:11:46	2	and he was just terribly terribly ill 
00:11:46	00:11:51	1	and i'm in in a doctor's appointment for him well before school was out it was like in uh 
00:11:51	00:11:54	2	and on cancelled it because he thought 
00:11:54	00:11:56	1	'cause it was like uh two 
00:11:56	00:12:03	2	talk or something then they were was worried that he was going to get out and time you know when we had to pick up case and they said you know 
00:12:03	00:12:05	1	week left to school or whatever it was 
00:12:05	00:12:07	2	all this weight and do it after school's out 
00:12:07	00:12:13	1	which would have been fine but never made another appointment <unk> so i mean unless i make an appointment for 
00:12:13	00:12:27	2	um you know and he's still seeing so many doctors back if he's back to physical therapy and his seeing the doctor for his shoulder and stuff so yeah i guess he is kind of doctor now but he needs to take care of themselves 
00:12:27	00:12:29	1	yeah 
00:12:29	00:12:30	2	[noise] 
00:12:30	00:12:36	1	that's what the doctor you know he started scaring me seeing all this but then he also said that you know 
00:12:36	00:12:39	2	is it 
00:12:39	00:12:47	1	sometimes with age it gets better you know he's just going to play it by ear and see what happens you know it could get better and i don't have 
00:12:47	00:12:57	2	<unk> could get worse like it goes into remission oh really like cancers do that the <unk> or <unk> both can do that but um 
00:12:57	00:12:58	1	mhm 
00:13:10	00:13:10	1	mhm 
00:13:10	00:13:13	2	kind of wait and see how 
00:13:13	00:13:17	1	see if you have to think what else and that yeah and how severe they are 
00:13:17	00:13:22	2	and then he said he you know if i had more problems he'll have to but 
00:13:22	00:13:23	1	mhm 
00:13:23	00:13:27	2	so see we 
00:13:27	00:13:28	1	mhm 
00:13:28	00:13:32	2	i have to go through that again 
00:13:32	00:13:47	1	i don't uh <unk> it's good enough but i started feeling better now were you just kinda yeah i am i still feel like it just really took a lot out i mean it was so tired mhm and uh after that but

00:13:51	00:13:57	1	yeah they put me out for surgery and that and it seems like when i go under anesthetic i just 
00:13:57	00:13:58	2	mhm 
00:13:58	00:14:02	1	takes me a long time to come out of that or for that stuff to get out of my system 
00:14:02	00:14:11	2	and uh you know about that first week i got after i was home course can't without us 
00:14:11	00:14:12	1	on and [laughter]

00:15:15	00:15:17	1	[noise] so

00:22:55	00:23:14	2	and then um 'cause you know we wouldn't have a house payment or anything but i mean that would be our house payment mhm um because we'd have you know fifty thousand if not more for a down payment so we so i i think we're gonna try done i've been talking about it more and more and i think that's what we were going to try to do so
