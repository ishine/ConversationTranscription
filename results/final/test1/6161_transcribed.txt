00:13:37	00:13:37	1	it is 
00:13:37	00:13:43	2	the only problem with this place and it's a big one is that there's no phone but i 
00:13:43	00:13:46	1	that i figured out how to work that 
00:13:46	00:13:53	2	the thing is is worth all all it's going to change is is the number for you i wrote all this and the letter by okay but um 
00:13:53	00:13:54	1	tell you uh 
00:13:54	00:14:01	2	i mean they give you a new number and then i'll just go they have these stories of phones where people use the phone because a lot of people don't have phones 
00:14:07	00:14:18	2	there and that and i'm so much closer to the old city to city itself i'm not like off in the boondocks anymore in this place so it it'll be like a two minute walk and i'll just go there at night you know

00:15:58	00:16:02	1	and also this <unk> has come back into town or as we know 
00:16:02	00:16:10	2	into town does that mean back in [noise] california los angeles yeah he's been gone all the time yeah he's been in atlanta ever since

00:16:25	00:16:37	2	oh good he's been wanting to move that into that direction yeah yeah and i said well i think he's just now finally getting enough information about what to get like probably just now feeling like maybe 
00:16:38	00:16:41	2	produce would be worse for it we're doing it on 
00:16:41	00:16:45	1	yeah she's <unk> nothing's been heard about the two spaniel 
00:16:45	00:17:02	2	no no okay and i forgot you know we did we have talked to him since he went back and i [noise] he was only here weaker week and a half so he shouldn't have missed them or anything but yeah to ask him i doubt that he heard from we haven't heard from a guy in and months 
00:17:02	00:17:06	1	oh wait a minute i get a letter in the day 
00:17:06	00:17:13	2	oh yeah well yes and it and it went ahead and and it <unk> i forgot that oh yeah i guess i did hear from guy in the day 
00:17:13	00:17:15	1	so they talk about it 
00:17:15	00:17:23	2	oh he say anything about it and read it i didn't read it because i had some other message oh okay and uh and now i just read 
00:17:42	00:17:44	1	well yeah i think he's <unk> 
00:17:44	00:17:47	2	some sort of like you'd slipped into indianapolis 
00:17:47	00:17:49	1	right 
00:17:49	00:17:50	2	i think he likes it 
00:17:50	00:17:54	1	and uh there really isn't any great reasons for him to ah to 
00:18:06	00:18:07	1	and you think you should move on them 
00:18:07	00:18:09	2	no not really 
00:18:09	00:18:15	1	the only other way would move on would be to go out to california right now and i think that's a little scary 
00:18:15	00:18:23	2	i think he needs a couple more years yeah well and one of his teachers has told him that well do you think you ought to go on for a masters 
00:18:23	00:18:28	1	yeah i mean he's if he's going to be there for two years you might as well get the pay 
00:18:28	00:18:37	2	well i think he's uh i i think that's his reasoning and meanwhile he wants to turn out a professional tape yeah uh which or 
00:18:37	00:18:40	1	feels at home there now and and <unk> that's good 
00:18:40	00:18:49	2	yeah so i think it's positive that he have uh experiences that he looks back on positively right critical 
00:18:49	00:18:51	1	yeah yeah 
00:18:51	00:18:58	2	yeah it's kinda it's it's fun to challenge yourself but you don't want to be in a constant state of challenges you probably are for this year 
00:18:58	00:19:04	1	yeah there's times i tell you that that i i understand what it is to miss people now 
00:19:04	00:19:08	2	oh really good do you miss us i mean 
00:19:08	00:19:15	1	i used to miss people before but but it wasn't like so far that there was nothing anybody could ever do right 
00:19:15	00:19:18	2	right and so you get to dreaming 
00:19:18	00:19:24	1	don't dream but it is definitely a different feeling you know i mean i always knew that if 
00:19:24	00:19:27	2	if i needed to i could <unk> right yeah 
00:19:27	00:19:37	1	oh i could i could always i can remember back sometimes when i'd be away for a long time and i dream of sunset over the old 
00:19:50	00:19:51	1	i would 
00:19:51	00:19:54	2	i'm serious about that 'cause i know that feelings and uh 
00:19:54	00:19:59	1	and if the stress gets up to highway enjoyment seems to 
00:19:59	00:20:06	2	[laughter] yeah i mean there's beautiful things about this place and and 
00:20:06	00:20:12	1	i mean you can go to the market and bite amazing food [laughter] right 
00:20:12	00:20:15	2	you know it'll be missing spring yeah you will 
00:20:15	00:20:19	1	yeah i know it's really kind of terrible 
00:20:19	00:20:25	2	'cause you're in between <unk> two places yeah those places 
00:20:33	00:20:35	2	well see that's 
00:20:35	00:20:37	1	see in at some point 
00:20:37	00:20:48	2	i felt i felt i felt that already a little bit i mean not completely but a little bit and that's what i'm saying is is a little bit not not as little unsettling 
00:20:48	00:20:55	1	really helped me a static going home you have to go in and out the music college he's just so you could go jumping from one 
00:20:55	00:20:58	2	yeah 
00:20:58	00:20:58	1	that's what it is 
00:20:58	00:21:00	2	right i mean when there's 
00:21:02	00:21:15	2	all the places you go to you know i mean but but you don't really belong anywhere except one place that yeah but when you start to belong one into into the other places then it it's scary well the 
00:21:15	00:21:19	1	interesting thing is in recent years walter has has
