00:00:06	00:00:07	1	mhm 
00:00:09	00:00:12	1	kids are you in college they should do some public service 
00:00:12	00:00:13	1	[noise] um 
00:00:13	00:00:14	2	mhm 
00:00:14	00:00:14	1	mhm 
00:00:15	00:00:16	1	part of part of it 
00:00:17	00:00:18	2	i agree with you sometimes it's 
00:00:20	00:00:21	1	i think less funding 
00:00:21	00:00:21	2	yeah 
00:00:23	00:00:23	2	mhm 
00:00:24	00:00:24	1	mhm 
00:00:24	00:00:27	2	i think you just about have to be away from home 
00:00:27	00:00:28	1	oh you're 
00:00:28	00:00:30	2	under less than ideal conditions 
00:00:30	00:00:32	1	[laughter] 
00:00:32	00:00:36	2	to learn some of the uh uh uh you know lessons that really needs to be learned 
00:00:36	00:00:38	2	may i may i ask how old you are 
00:00:38	00:00:40	1	i'm twenty six 
00:00:40	00:00:41	2	young enough so you might have been 
00:00:41	00:00:44	1	[laughter] 
00:00:44	00:00:49	2	so yeah i really i really feel that um if every kid had to be away from home 
00:00:50	00:00:52	1	when they got back they certainly would have a <unk> 
00:00:52	00:00:56	2	yeah that's true some people send far too much time 
00:00:57	00:01:01	2	yeah i mean the same thing and that and that really you know seeing any other part of the world 
00:01:02	00:01:04	2	and you know mom and dad and homework

00:01:18	00:01:20	2	but um yeah i think it would 
00:01:20	00:01:21	1	wonderful 
00:01:22	00:01:22	1	mhm 
00:01:22	00:01:24	2	and i think it would broaden the the 
00:01:24	00:01:25	1	horizon 
00:01:26	00:01:27	1	of the kids 
00:01:27	00:01:27	2	really 
00:01:28	00:01:31	2	the way the rest of the world the rest of the country live 
00:01:31	00:01:32	1	mhm 
00:01:32	00:01:33	1	oh certainly would 
00:01:34	00:01:35	1	mhm 
00:01:35	00:01:37	1	<unk> 
00:01:37	00:01:39	2	getting a feeling for humanity itself i think 
00:01:40	00:01:41	1	yeah 
00:01:42	00:01:43	2	uh-huh 
00:01:43	00:01:44	1	no i haven't

00:01:45	00:01:50	2	uh i just survive los angeles [laughter] i was just down there last 
00:01:50	00:01:56	1	listen that evening funny i don't know why i left please forgive me it has to have been awful 
00:01:56	00:01:57	2	it was 
00:01:58	00:02:01	2	okay you know i heard gunfire it's it's the first time i felt my wife was 
00:02:01	00:02:03	1	you know a little bit threatened 
00:02:03	00:02:04	1	mhm 
00:02:07	00:02:12	2	the people in the helicopter that did not land and things that guy from being 
00:02:12	00:02:14	1	yeah i know 
00:02:14	00:02:14	1	mhm 
00:02:15	00:02:17	1	well they have they never they never interfere 
00:02:17	00:02:21	2	[noise] well i mean this is not like we're fighting the war someplace else 
00:02:21	00:02:23	1	i know 
00:02:23	00:02:29	2	[laughter] this is this is the bad guys were killing us i'm sorry you know i just can't believe that they didn't go down there 
00:02:29	00:02:31	1	stop that from happening 
00:02:31	00:02:34	2	and it seems like you know basic basic decency 
00:02:34	00:02:35	1	you know require them to do it 
00:02:42	00:02:43	1	do you have to protect right 
00:02:43	00:02:45	2	but um 
00:02:45	00:02:46	1	well 
00:02:46	00:02:51	2	let's think on this for a moment if if you had been required some time 
00:02:51	00:02:54	2	around the age of twenty to spend a year or someplace 
00:02:54	00:02:55	1	something 
00:02:55	00:02:57	1	what what sort of things to make you feel 
00:02:57	00:02:58	2	would be uh 
00:02:58	00:03:00	1	the type of things that 
00:03:00	00:03:01	2	good for the country 
00:03:01	00:03:01	1	mhm 
00:03:02	00:03:03	1	i don't know i 
00:03:05	00:03:07	1	see how other people live i mean you know 
00:03:07	00:03:10	2	i tend to be you know in in my own circle of friends 
00:03:11	00:03:13	2	we're all pretty much the same 
00:03:13	00:03:15	1	the middle class probably 
00:03:15	00:03:16	1	mhm 
00:03:16	00:03:17	1	probably even higher than that 
00:03:17	00:03:23	2	no i was in california so it's not really upper middle class here's the problem 
00:03:24	00:03:26	2	yeah that's true it's um 
00:03:26	00:03:28	1	[noise] you feel that um 
00:03:31	00:03:34	2	basic training ought to be a mandatory part of this year 
00:03:35	00:03:36	2	you have any feelings about that 
00:03:37	00:03:37	1	mhm 
00:03:40	00:03:42	2	i mean what do you do with them 
00:03:43	00:03:45	2	well you okay you make it as 
00:03:45	00:03:47	1	as you can right 
00:03:47	00:03:51	2	for everybody you know and if they just can't make it uh 
00:03:51	00:03:54	1	it's like other things you you less than that so that they can make it 
00:03:55	00:03:59	2	you try to demand that much of them but if they can't make it and and there are people you know who 
00:03:59	00:04:00	1	or not 
00:04:00	00:04:02	2	we're not as healthy and so on and so forth 
00:04:02	00:04:02	1	mhm 
00:04:05	00:04:07	2	sure sure there's plenty of do 
00:04:07	00:04:09	2	i mean if it's like in high school or 
00:04:09	00:04:11	1	junior high or wherever 
00:04:11	00:04:13	1	that certain people are 
00:04:13	00:04:15	1	excuse for 
00:04:15	00:04:19	2	the gym class or whatever but in the mean almost everybody has to do 
00:04:19	00:04:20	1	yeah 
00:04:22	00:04:23	1	yeah 
00:04:27	00:04:30	2	people need to to meet other types of people 
00:04:35	00:04:36	1	and yeah and 
00:04:36	00:04:37	2	doesn't really do it 
00:04:37	00:04:38	1	no not not at all 
00:04:38	00:04:41	2	yeah first of all not everybody gets a chance to go to college 
00:04:41	00:04:42	1	but in college 
00:04:42	00:04:43	2	you're still 
00:04:44	00:04:47	2	among basically the same class of people you've grown up 
00:04:47	00:04:48	1	right 
00:04:48	00:04:50	1	so you don't get to see 
00:04:50	00:04:51	2	the other half lives or the other 
00:04:51	00:04:52	1	two thirds or however 
00:04:52	00:04:54	2	many there are now
