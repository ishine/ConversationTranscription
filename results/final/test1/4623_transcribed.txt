00:01:17	00:01:20	1	i don't know <unk> <unk> there'll be a reason for that 
00:01:20	00:01:24	2	it could be i don't know what it is it can be ah lends doesn't adjust well 
00:01:24	00:01:29	1	'cause it's always the outdoor picks right and this i took a lot 
00:01:29	00:01:35	2	well that i don't know really yeah maybe it could be that how you face the sun 
00:01:35	00:01:40	1	yeah and also i think the sunday or the more right the sun is if you're a comes out 
00:01:40	00:01:53	2	when it's too bright just doesn't handle yeah mhm okay joy how <unk> how <unk> good just great yeah i mean i decided for half an hour i can tell you all the customers that don't come out on the letter 
00:01:53	00:02:01	1	one minute you're little daughter which one very the little one very fancy oh yeah he is 
00:02:01	00:02:14	2	but i should call it up the walls [laughter] i'm not used to looking out for her and there she is that the red grand oh wow [laughter] well what what gives you that idea 
00:02:14	00:02:19	1	the look in her eyes [laughter] 
00:02:19	00:02:25	2	is quite very mixed united states is wise yeah 
00:02:25	00:02:26	1	hello 
00:02:26	00:02:38	2	broke i woke up in the middle of the night and she was wet yeah she told me even with the diaper yeah it's on missions all wet we have to pick up the predominant [laughter] definitely put it in the sun [laughter] 
00:02:38	00:02:42	1	[laughter] [laughter] in the middle of the night 
00:02:42	00:02:58	2	[laughter] yeah [laughter] so style like let's see i see that she's beginning to she takes the knowledge if he picks up in one place and see applies it in another place uh-huh i i think one of the most intelligent things she said so far there's one time in the middle of no place we never discussed it or anything 
00:02:58	00:02:59	1	that's neat 
00:02:59	00:03:04	2	<unk> <unk> oh she figured that i 
00:03:04	00:03:05	1	i thought that was pretty 
00:03:05	00:03:07	2	[laughter] 
00:03:07	00:03:11	1	what else did she say the other day she <unk> she she <unk> 
00:03:11	00:03:16	2	so she says oh you want to go to the store <unk> come into the carriage come and go into this 
00:03:16	00:03:23	1	hey i'm good [laughter] and then you felt like you were hearing a tape recording of you 
00:03:23	00:03:35	2	much very much like it makes me really be careful who started saying when ever i would ask the worst times battle i don't know i don't know so then everytime i'm about to answer i realize how many times i really was about to say i don't 
00:03:35	00:03:40	1	mhm like if she asked me where my <unk> where am i where the <unk> 
00:03:40	00:03:43	2	so instead of saying i don't know i'll say well let's look for that 
00:03:43	00:03:44	1	[laughter] 'cause she parrots 
00:03:44	00:03:47	2	i mean i don't know [laughter] 
00:04:02	00:04:04	1	when we were kids that was my favorite 
00:04:19	00:04:24	2	two and a half years old [laughter] looks the loudest about something

00:12:19	00:12:30	2	nice way of solving problems she told me that last year this was this idea was conceived last year she wanted to tell the girls that when they come they should be careful of the noise the first night it's not you know it's important 
00:12:30	00:12:33	1	cause they're you know they're all excited and all that
