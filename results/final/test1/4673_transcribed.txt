00:03:18	00:03:24	1	this came from a <unk> that she had written for her masters here you know she has a second masters in english 
00:03:24	00:03:29	2	oh it became a book that's so wonderful

00:03:36	00:03:37	1	yeah 
00:03:37	00:03:53	2	hard time here this morning it's such a difficult time here this morning i couldn't imagine living on her and her that isn't so devastating i can't begin to tell you a hundred people are willing to in seven did yes yes i did just on but 
00:03:53	00:03:55	1	well how long can this 
00:03:55	00:03:56	2	um i don't know 
00:03:56	00:04:03	1	i you know <unk> it's it's a feeling of helplessness everybody's in danger [noise] it's a whole country that you know but 
00:04:03	00:04:09	2	everyone is a danger i don't care where you are you could have <unk> and what they wanted to do 
00:04:09	00:04:13	1	well as long as somebody's willing to blow himself up it makes it very different 
00:04:13	00:04:18	2	well they're they're a link to that they're willing to do it it's 
00:04:18	00:04:20	1	said either it is so unbelievable 
00:04:23	00:04:26	1	i know all in again 
00:04:26	00:04:41	2	no we have to do something no i don't know if it has really i'm not sure because i feel that that people would like to seal off the the arab countries from gossip for example and just not let them come in any more and let them do whatever they have to do the hook they should also be able to 
00:04:41	00:04:43	1	<unk> yes 
00:04:43	00:04:44	2	harm in their own features 
00:04:44	00:04:48	1	she she got a religious element both here in america and in israel 
00:04:48	00:04:56	2	who would <unk> ended up hanging out and not <unk> not <unk> not the guys are but the government does come on yet 
00:05:06	00:05:12	2	[noise] it is very devastating every day to get up and hear of another <unk> it's very devastating 
00:05:12	00:05:14	1	it's terrible 
00:05:18	00:05:19	1	yeah they are bad you 
00:05:19	00:05:25	2	per and hear the rail and it's it's i'm just worried how long this came along 
00:05:25	00:05:28	1	because you see a robbins is having a 
00:05:28	00:05:31	2	the time to satisfy easy element you know 
00:05:31	00:05:33	1	well he has to continue 
00:05:33	00:05:51	2	and of course there's no there's no choice you'll see grace this goes back to nineteen sixty seven after the six day war right i was teaching english appear english at the curiosity and i had some very interesting discussions with them back then when i said to him we've got 
00:05:51	00:05:52	1	settle with the arabs before 
00:05:52	00:05:55	2	strong and he laughed at me i said some day 
00:05:55	00:06:00	1	you know what i have said yeah should be settled because the longer you wait 'til she 
00:06:00	00:06:13	2	nineteen sixty seven we should have given it back right than there and get it over with yeah because it gets along very mad with goes up because she refused to do it but you see the whole thing was we're proud we showed them we could 
00:06:13	00:06:23	1	and so therefore why should we talk to them they're they're the underdog now and so i'll never forget what the girls said to be in a seminar lewinsky 
00:06:23	00:06:35	2	when i brought up the issue they were ready to choke me they said what do you mean they were ready to throw us into the see now we can throw them into the see well i have <unk> i still remember those discussion is it
