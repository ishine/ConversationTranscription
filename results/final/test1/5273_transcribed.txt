00:23:14	00:23:16	1	understandable

00:23:39	00:23:42	1	every two months you know 
00:23:42	00:23:44	2	and that's for a doctor for a while

00:24:15	00:24:17	1	that's kinda cool 
00:24:17	00:24:26	2	yeah it's kind of names of the paper from seattle and stuff so yeah it's that's that's a good thing 
00:24:26	00:24:27	1	mhm <unk> 
00:24:27	00:24:31	2	mhm do you hear the after that i hear 
00:24:31	00:24:34	1	yes i don't know if it's a function of the line or the recording device 
00:24:34	00:24:42	2	i'm assuming the recording device that isn't that i'd say that it's weird sort of unnerving uncanny 
00:24:59	00:25:04	1	i always watch t._v. like that usually an internal dialogue though [laughter] 
00:25:04	00:25:11	2	hang out with this guy days and it was actually about a laser the biggest leader in the world so cool 
00:25:11	00:25:12	1	[laughter] 
00:25:12	00:25:21	2	right yeah <unk> where was this big laser don't probably los alamos 
00:25:21	00:25:27	1	no it's not much he'd been there though yeah 
00:25:34	00:25:36	1	i mean it's like the third biggest 
00:25:56	00:25:57	1	it's gotta be true 
00:25:57	00:25:59	2	you have to read it somewhere 
00:25:59	00:26:03	1	[noise] [noise] i know how you doing 
00:26:03	00:26:06	2	within the print it's gotta be true 
00:26:06	00:26:10	1	oh it's on the news 
00:26:10	00:26:16	2	just like michael jackson lisa marie presley in the paper it's true 
00:26:16	00:26:20	1	[noise] i don't think that even their rear real pardon me 
00:26:32	00:26:44	1	paper i thought it was a joke i had no idea that it was real i've been so isolated for a while i just couldn't believe that it can be fast food restaurants and yes 
00:26:44	00:26:50	2	strange but true mm 
00:26:50	00:26:57	1	yeah i understand what it's like the feel isolated fucking like yeah i know what's going on in the world from day to day 
00:26:57	00:26:59	2	[noise] barely do 
00:27:00	00:27:06	2	i read i mean we we have uh a paper's <unk> or the stars and stripes 
00:27:06	00:27:11	1	but it's all oriented mostly towards like you know obviously military type stuff 'cause the audience 
00:27:11	00:27:12	2	mhm 
00:27:12	00:27:18	1	so i have a good idea what's going on in the old international arena but as far as to what's going on in the states 
00:27:18	00:27:23	1	you know relatively clueless [noise] other than the o. j. trial 
00:27:23	00:27:28	2	[laughter] 
00:27:28	00:27:29	1	yeah 
00:27:29	00:27:38	2	the day after the o. j. <unk> the stars and stripes is usually only twenty to thirty pages long the first eight pages were devoted to nothing but o. j. 
00:27:38	00:27:39	1	mhm 
00:28:01	00:28:06	1	i see it's nice to pay fifty cents for a newspaper though a dollar 
00:28:06	00:28:14	2	yeah one nice thing about living in columbus is we have something to the time and some of the other people around here 
00:28:14	00:28:16	1	get the wall street journal 
00:28:16	00:28:26	2	yes there was a big article about my italian and my company actually in the wall street journal couple of weeks ago 
00:28:30	00:28:31	1	[laughter] 
00:28:31	00:28:52	2	[noise] which i guess is a good thing [laughter] it's kinda funny just because i mean we had this big furry civilian big beard long hair you know the whole nine yards and kind of wasted millions look but it's very different from the way we look and he's wandering around what we're doing the training and asking questions like and so what's that thing do machine gun 
00:28:52	00:28:54	1	[laughter] 
00:28:54	00:29:01	2	and you try to explain but he doesn't really understand and then he goes in there it's a story which ends up on the front page of the wall street journal 
00:29:01	00:29:02	1	mhm 
00:29:02	00:29:21	2	so like you know hundreds of thousands of people are going to read about third battalion three hundred twenty fifth into a tree and about what we were training and it was just well it was a decent article and it made us look kind of good there was a lot of stuff in there that you could tell he just didn't understand when he wrote about it they came out kinda screwy 
00:29:21	00:29:24	1	and this is the impression that the public 
00:29:24	00:29:27	2	which is unfortunate 
00:29:27	00:29:29	1	yeah or they <unk> they get a pen 
00:29:29	00:29:37	2	well unfortunately they're going to believe that paper [laughter] i mean it's typical reaction makes a wall street journal 
00:29:37	00:29:38	1	what did it 
00:29:38	00:29:45	2	[noise] i don't remember unfortunately i'm gonna i'm gonna get a copy of it and it's been my dad will send you a copy on 
00:29:45	00:29:48	1	oh tell me what it is i go to university 
00:29:48	00:29:51	2	that is true you are a librarian 
00:29:51	00:29:53	1	[laughter] i know how to find it to beaver 
00:29:55	00:29:57	1	yeah i'll find out though 
00:29:57	00:30:00	2	mhm
