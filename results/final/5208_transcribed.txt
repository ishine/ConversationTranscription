00:15:44	00:15:56	2	[noise] yes every everything problem no problem with the luggage i i the lord was very good to me because on my way i uh when i got to san francisco 
00:15:56	00:15:57	1	i had 
00:16:14	00:16:17	2	next to me on the plane there are three seats 
00:16:17	00:16:19	1	well the middle of seats 
00:16:19	00:16:20	2	<unk> this was empty 
00:16:33	00:16:35	1	bags off and you when you get 
00:16:35	00:16:38	2	the plane in taiwan in the airport it's 
00:16:38	00:16:40	1	long distance 
00:16:40	00:17:00	2	to walk before you get to the baggage really far and so she directed me there and uh then we got the baggage and um there was a man standing there and i saw my baggage and the carousel and he i asked him and he pulled it off he pulled off both of them for me and then i got one of these way against 
00:17:00	00:17:03	1	you know these carts yeah 
00:17:03	00:17:15	2	so and then we went through customs they didn't open anything i just had to declare when i brought and uh on the plane and he took the sheets and he just signed me to go right through so i was lucky 
00:17:15	00:17:16	1	to open 
00:17:16	00:17:23	2	did they have to open anything so that was a <unk> and then when we came through customs then immediately i 
00:17:23	00:17:28	1	see such a marketing mary so as soon as they go through the customs i could see her 
00:17:47	00:17:50	2	beg your pardon pretty good since you got there 
00:17:50	00:17:59	1	yeah i slept islip islip <unk> pretty good the first night and then last night she told me i i wake up a number of times but i slept

00:18:06	00:18:08	2	you know the rest of the afternoon here so 
00:18:08	00:18:10	1	you have a lot of like the worst 
00:18:10	00:18:17	2	that's not too much but you know uh uh i'm sure i'll feel it again today in the middle of the day 'cause i'm still 
00:18:17	00:18:21	1	kind of halfway and both times you know [laughter] but not too bad 
00:18:21	00:18:24	2	after nine now about nine thirty right 
00:18:24	00:18:27	1	yes here <unk> here in taiwan it's almost nine thirty 
00:18:27	00:18:31	2	oh yeah yeah 
00:18:31	00:18:34	1	hit it helped with the wash they do the <unk> 
00:18:34	00:18:48	2	thursdays and that's an experience [laughter] and ah it reminds me very much in florida if the weather was nice if the sun was out it would be lovely but today it's one of those <unk> rainy days and uh and why do you mind 
00:18:48	00:18:50	1	do you said you're going to go

00:25:21	00:25:23	1	chairs in the chapel 
00:25:23	00:25:26	2	no but their views you know and 
00:25:26	00:25:27	1	feels a little better 
00:25:27	00:25:32	2	then what do you have a big chapel here in their house this house was built for [noise] you know like 
00:25:32	00:25:34	1	provincial life [laughter] 
00:25:34	00:25:44	2	[laughter] it's a big house [laughter] i was surprised it's so big so um but it was big built against for a different purpose other than 
00:25:44	00:25:46	1	oh you have a lot of room then 
00:25:46	00:25:59	2	we have yeah they don't they're mostly bedrooms and then big community room but the community rooms large and so as a chapel large and then there's a little <unk> and the first floor and then the bedrooms around the second 
00:25:59	00:26:04	1	for every bedroom has um has uh as you into the bedroom 
00:26:04	00:26:13	2	the screen door in it which is very nice because the in the court or all those windows or flats and they're all open and so they don't have screens that 
00:26:13	00:26:19	1	so then they put the screens on your on your bedroom door so that the bugs don't come in there 
00:26:21	00:26:24	1	[laughter] and then the the windows in the 
00:26:24	00:26:32	2	screens that so that's nice well though i consider that or hang up pretty soon that's right
