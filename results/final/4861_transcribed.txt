00:07:22	00:07:24	1	uh school for the arts 
00:07:24	00:07:28	2	and and um if it is it like risky

00:07:32	00:07:35	2	[noise] like what does it include 
00:07:35	00:07:37	1	music theater 
00:07:37	00:07:42	2	oh i see i see so is it is it mainly like an undergraduate years 
00:07:42	00:07:49	1	people are there who would be otherwise going through uh is it mainly attended by people who are between eighteen and twenty two 
00:08:00	00:08:06	1	do you know <unk> at all how many students that has no mhm does it have a a substantial 
00:08:06	00:08:12	2	um visual arts program it's the best one here 
00:08:12	00:08:14	1	mhm are there are a lot of course is offered 
00:08:14	00:08:19	2	[noise] [noise] i don't know what you mean by a lot 
00:08:19	00:08:23	1	well could could you and roll into other courses if you wanted to 
00:08:23	00:08:24	2	mhm 
00:08:26	00:08:30	2	in addition to the one you're already in order to other things that you'd also like to take 
00:08:30	00:08:35	1	for example 
00:08:36	00:08:42	2	i don't know what the limit is for i know there's a limit for students 
00:08:42	00:08:45	1	[noise] oh 
00:08:45	00:08:47	2	[noise] uh limit for what you know i'm thinking 
00:08:47	00:08:53	1	about this job that i just took that you know you seem to think is a dead end and obviously doesn't making 
00:09:05	00:09:08	2	<unk> i can't tell you what you did or not 
00:09:08	00:09:14	1	and i was trying to figure out what i 
00:09:14	00:09:25	2	whether you made a mistake or not i can't possibly tail and i and i i don't even have enough information to say whether you did or not and you find out and if it's a huge mistake you just 
00:09:25	00:09:27	1	that's all 
00:09:32	00:09:34	1	oh i didn't tell them anything 
00:09:34	00:09:39	2	okay is that it is that really such an awful job found it to me like a lot of interesting things 
00:09:39	00:09:45	1	sounded to me like too much but it sounded like a very interesting sort of things is that something you definitely 
00:09:45	00:09:54	2	would not want to do [noise] you had said that was nice you would you would said that was an easier job in some ways 
00:09:54	00:09:57	1	actually i don't think so anymore because i think that it's too many things 
00:09:57	00:10:04	2	[noise] are are you going to have two for either one of them are you going to have to spend hours preparing outside of the hours that you actually get paid for 
00:10:04	00:10:05	1	mhm 
00:10:11	00:10:21	2	because i don't think that that would be warranted [noise] at at the salary that they're giving you i i think that you want to be able to <unk> hours very carefully 
00:10:21	00:10:22	1	uh-huh 
00:10:22	00:10:31	2	i just this call yesterday from this i mean i it was on a message on my machine when i came home from this [noise] nurse at uh 
00:10:31	00:10:33	1	school nearby 
00:10:33	00:10:44	2	saying i should color about openings and the district that she called me because of one of the letters i wrote to one of the principals oh yeah who knows what kinds of openings 
00:10:44	00:10:46	1	mhm mhm 
00:10:46	00:10:58	2	i know how <unk> you know when i was in graduate school i i spent a lot of time in my last year of college thinking about whether <unk> wanted to go into bio physics we're wanting to teach little kids 
00:11:05	00:11:08	1	but i went into bio physics 
00:11:17	00:11:18	1	mhm 
00:11:18	00:11:20	2	and i just walked out of one lie but i 
00:11:20	00:11:24	1	this is it i just don't want it i wanted to be teaching little 
00:11:24	00:11:29	2	kids because daddy was at that point noncommittal say the least 
00:11:37	00:11:38	1	very bright guy he was 
00:11:38	00:11:48	2	cried shoulder i cried on when i took the exit during that time too for the doctor given it to me for cramps and i ended up getting um depressed for twenty four hours 
00:11:48	00:11:51	1	um and 
00:11:51	00:11:55	2	he said to me you really want to change i said yeah i really want to 
00:11:55	00:11:57	1	so he's just will take the bus across the river 
00:11:57	00:12:17	2	noone because i had already applied and been accepted to the i mean it went so far that i would i applied both to bio physics and to um harvard school with it and i didn't apply to any other at schools because i figured i could get in in there which i had and i went across the river that day and i said can i get into your next year's class 
00:12:17	00:12:18	1	absolutely 
00:12:18	00:12:24	2	and i mean by then it was like may certainly april certainly april not not not earlier 
00:12:24	00:12:26	1	and 
00:12:26	00:12:37	2	i remember my home state it was upset about it but everybody knew what i was doing it and everybody and it was obvious even to daddy where i just had to had to do that for a while i couldn't just studies lanes for a while 
00:12:44	00:12:47	1	yeah i guess i was twenty two already um 
00:12:47	00:12:50	2	and um and and 
00:12:51	00:12:55	1	and i it it's it's not any rational kind of thing 
00:13:02	00:13:04	1	it's 
00:13:04	00:13:15	2	that that that you don't know what you want to do i didn't know what i wanted to do at that stage well i did but it was out of reach and for you it's obviously out of reach too unless it works out with matt you haven't met him 
00:13:15	00:13:18	1	and therefore 
00:13:18	00:13:24	2	i'm i'm i i'm disappointed and how you're going about it 
00:13:25	00:13:27	1	<unk> 
00:13:27	00:13:40	2	i don't see i don't see i mean i i i've i've known so many people who didn't get married and so many people who got married too late to have children it's very sad i find it very sad i didn't 
00:13:49	00:13:50	1	mhm 
00:13:50	00:13:53	2	'cause he was very slow socially 
00:13:53	00:13:55	1	and and and 
00:13:55	00:13:58	2	you never can tell with life there aren't any rules about it 
00:13:58	00:14:00	1	and uh 
00:14:00	00:14:14	2	nobody's nobody's written the the future and it's not really it's it's a prayer and uh uh pet engines doesn't really help it's gonna happen with things are going to happen when it happened they happen but you have to there there are ways to help 
00:14:14	00:14:19	1	along there are ways to help them along and maybe you're doing them but i don't see it 
00:14:19	00:14:26	2	i know you went out with some guy the other night may maybe you are looking actively but i i don't see it so all i can do is sit and worry 
00:14:26	00:14:27	1	mhm 
00:14:32	00:14:34	1	job things now 
00:14:53	00:14:54	1	mhm

00:15:06	00:15:14	1	[noise] maybe you can it's it's [noise] that would be that would be interesting if you know you have hours during the week that are available 
00:15:14	00:15:15	2	mhm 
00:15:15	00:15:17	1	mhm 
00:15:17	00:15:23	2	don't don't don't block them out until you find out whether or not you can take a an art course during the week 
00:15:23	00:15:24	1	mhm 
00:15:24	00:15:29	1	[noise] [noise]

00:16:10	00:16:22	2	well that's what otherwise otherwise i i'm i'm cooking and nobody's eating it it's it's recycling it's it's work working that nobody nobody ever knows about that's not what defines me as a person with the 
00:16:22	00:16:25	1	we as a person is is is my family 
00:16:25	00:16:29	2	in your family your daughter
