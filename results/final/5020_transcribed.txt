00:08:41	00:09:00	2	stared at me once and then i saw her get interesting it'd be getting kind of snow that me so i approached there and push to one day outside on campus and i saw her again with her friend and uh and just the reason why is because i was walking by and i saw her with her friend and it and then she stopped and was put into the end of their friend looked at me so it was obvious that they were talking about 
00:09:00	00:09:01	1	right 
00:09:01	00:09:07	2	i went over to push somebody just introduce and stuff like that high and then it turns out that she the medals major and she's seventeen

00:20:18	00:20:20	2	you are 
00:20:20	00:20:20	1	that's what i want 
00:20:20	00:20:23	2	you know you're not near me 
00:20:23	00:20:24	1	okay 
00:20:26	00:20:27	1	right 
00:20:27	00:20:33	2	but it's okay though i'm doing okay i didn't think that it would be this easy yeah it's an easy but i mean i didn't think that it would be 
00:20:42	00:20:48	2	right i know what you mean because i can do the same thing and just 
00:20:50	00:20:51	1	i don't like 
00:20:56	00:20:58	1	routine is good for me 
00:20:58	00:21:04	2	such as when i don't get up and work out in a bad mood 
00:21:04	00:21:05	1	mhm 
00:21:05	00:21:09	2	and i have to watch out for that i can't let myself 
00:21:09	00:21:10	1	be laced 
00:21:10	00:21:11	2	see 
00:21:12	00:21:15	2	or else i feel that 
00:21:19	00:21:21	1	and being 
00:21:22	00:21:24	2	i mean it's not a bad thing 
00:21:25	00:21:29	2	so it works for me it makes me feel better right 
00:21:29	00:21:30	1	completely 
00:21:30	00:21:39	2	yeah but yet i hope that i can still be spontaneous i don't want to get into too much of a routine that um i can't do anything without 
00:21:40	00:21:50	2	but like i don't want to be so much in a routine that i can't do anything other than the routine you know i don't want that to happen but i don't think it will 
00:21:50	00:21:54	1	i'm okay i like you know i like to do new things and go new places and stuff right 
00:21:55	00:21:59	1	yeah i don't laugh at me 
00:21:59	00:22:04	2	yeah you're living with you [noise] 
00:22:04	00:22:15	1	i talked to my advisor last night and she told me what to do about signing up student teaching and i need to go she told me where to go to get the form 
00:22:15	00:22:19	2	and i have to teach a class 
00:22:21	00:22:34	2	mhm yeah i didn't know that [noise] which is okay she said that there's some <unk> a few schools in south philly <unk> teach italian so what is available and you know most likely they will have french and spanish too 
00:22:34	00:22:36	1	so 
00:22:36	00:22:45	2	i would have like three cooperating teachers that i would be working with and have three different languages enough to make different all different lesson plans and stuff 
00:22:45	00:22:48	1	but the good thing about that is 
00:22:49	00:22:52	2	south philly schools i think are going to be better than north 
00:22:52	00:22:53	1	schools maybe 
00:22:54	00:22:56	1	and they didn't want to teach 
00:22:56	00:23:00	2	in philadelphia but i guess it's better to go 
00:23:00	00:23:05	1	to south philly <unk> north maybe not i could be wrong that just the impression again 
00:23:05	00:23:08	2	[noise] and then this way i won't need the car 
00:23:08	00:23:10	1	you're in philly 
00:23:10	00:23:13	2	if i taught outside the city i gauge 
00:23:13	00:23:18	1	bring the fox here so i'd have it but then i'd have to worry about parking and paying for gas and everything 
00:23:18	00:23:21	2	mhm so that's good 
00:23:21	00:23:22	1	that 
00:23:23	00:23:25	2	that i can yeah that there was a place that's 
00:23:25	00:23:27	1	we'll probably be 
00:23:27	00:23:29	2	pretty good place here close by 
00:23:30	00:23:33	2	so i'm glad about that and hopefully it'll work
