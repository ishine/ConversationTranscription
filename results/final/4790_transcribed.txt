00:05:58	00:06:03	1	birthday party minded too so excited next door neighbor right [laughter] 
00:06:03	00:06:07	2	touching over screams wow 
00:06:07	00:06:15	1	okay the whole time [laughter] miserable [laughter] bringing in the back yard but it was a back yard 
00:06:17	00:06:19	1	well so it was <unk> 
00:06:19	00:06:27	2	there wasn't any chairs for me either no chairs he had to bring his own high chair [noise] serious sitting inside you know the kids are sitting in regular <unk> oh 'cause it's an older kids too 
00:06:27	00:06:29	1	oh okay 
00:06:29	00:06:38	2	so um <unk> just as soon as i walked in screaming 
00:06:38	00:06:47	1	i <unk> i brought him in the back yard they have a copy house with a little stand pit under [noise] he played there with his with trucks for so long he loved that 
00:06:47	00:06:49	2	sort of calm down 
00:06:56	00:06:57	2	yeah 
00:06:57	00:07:00	1	<unk> 
00:07:00	00:07:00	2	[laughter] 
00:07:00	00:07:02	1	we gotta go right 
00:07:02	00:07:07	2	[laughter] [laughter] things to look forward to it happens 
00:07:07	00:07:15	1	what does it every time we think it's going to be something wonderful he's just mortified like we took him to this concert [noise] the way it goes you sent pictures 
00:07:15	00:07:25	2	oh and and at first we got we didn't sit all the way in front there was like sitting in front you know get on the floor but we were still in that sexual we could sit on the floor 
00:07:25	00:07:27	1	as soon as we both came out he was like 
00:07:27	00:07:30	2	they're very quiet 
00:07:37	00:07:42	2	oh okay so you know those things can be pretty scary too young kid like that 
00:07:42	00:07:46	1	i think especially 'cause he was watching them on the table a time and all of a sudden they're there in person 
00:07:46	00:07:51	2	yeah and they're big you know yeah like it on television yeah 
00:07:51	00:07:57	1	so uh we're ah we want to put him into daycare so putting him in daycare at least one day a week so 
00:07:57	00:08:03	2	really good idea i didn't know if you guys were going to do that or not well it's a little bit of it it's a little bit of a dilemma right 
00:08:03	00:08:06	1	because and craig's mother watches tyson yeah 
00:08:06	00:08:10	2	she's very upset about the fact that we've even considered it 
00:08:10	00:08:13	1	but it's much better for tyson even just one day a week 
00:08:13	00:08:19	2	well exactly right and then she will be too i think it's a little bit less stimulation with grandma because um 
00:08:19	00:08:21	1	there's a tremendous attachment as a matter of fact 
00:08:21	00:08:23	2	we find that uh 
00:08:23	00:08:32	1	we usually have a pretty bad day with him on saturdays mhm figure out why is because that's what he has mommy and daddy get full time and yeah 
00:08:32	00:08:40	2	is that what is right either you know have a good saturday well that's what i figured well we're going to start off with wednesday 'cause it just works easier for us to go first 
00:08:47	00:08:54	2	two half days out of the week and that's it [noise] so but it's <unk> it's it's very hard with that because 
00:08:54	00:09:03	1	takes it very personally you know like instead of just reaching out that this is what something that we want to do 'cause with the parents that also be good for you know she's just so personally i know we're going to have 
00:09:03	00:09:20	2	with my mother in law and the babies born [noise] oh yeah probably just you know for the same thing just you know they want you to do the things but but then again you know if they're too opinionated [noise] like uh i had i don't know if i tell you is we have these battles about 
00:09:20	00:09:21	1	food every once in a while 
00:09:21	00:09:31	2	you know like uh uh if if if she's not you know she's giving us something that you shouldn't have it if i say no i don't want them to have that it's like it's too personal like oh you don't think i'm doing a good job 
00:09:31	00:09:33	1	yeah 
00:09:40	00:09:52	2	oh yeah oh was it the tests tyson has the best time to be such a oh you should see him it's just such a really a quiz it of kids you know they have a great back yard and huge 
00:09:52	00:10:00	1	just a rain forest and um it's next to a resort a um a resort that um 
00:10:05	00:10:11	1	all these birds palm trees and all the um the the prices to stay out of these little <unk> 
00:10:11	00:10:19	2	the through the fence you can see that you get it and actually from the house you could see the lake and it it gives the appearance like uh 
00:10:19	00:10:20	1	back yard so 
00:10:20	00:10:33	2	'cause the way the vegetation so anyway touching sense of the fence now any calls the birds at all these <unk> water birds and ducks come over and he feeds him down through the fence all the time 
00:10:33	00:10:36	1	that's pretty good yeah it's really good and they have a 
00:10:36	00:10:58	2	bob the back yard so it was constantly in there and he'd grand dead so we're showing and things and and lose made these pathways through the ah [noise] all through the trees mhm it's like uh uh uh you know like so each each time it's like he's on this little adventure going through all the tree that's pretty liberty and everything oh listen he's such an outdoor kitty 
00:10:58	00:11:01	1	credible mhm that's a lot of fun yeah 
00:11:01	00:11:05	2	[noise] it didn't feel guilty it's better for him to be in daycare at his age 
00:11:05	00:11:07	1	oh i think so i 
00:11:07	00:11:08	2	one day a week 
00:11:08	00:11:14	1	i personally think so because he's really very socially i'm involved because i don't get to uh 
00:11:14	00:11:21	2	[noise] i don't get to take him to play group like my other mothers and like i don't get together with other mothers you know have the kids and all yeah 
00:11:21	00:11:28	1	i think the research says something like up until two years it's better to be home but starting at two years it's better to be in uh 
00:11:28	00:11:30	2	daycare for some part of the time 
00:11:30	00:11:35	1	yeah well you know it's it's just studying the socialization process the better 
00:11:35	00:11:41	2	you know what are the best of both worlds cause you'll be able to have 'em at home and and daycare too yeah so yeah 
00:11:41	00:11:45	1	yeah i think all all the time with the difficult because i went to visit um a couple 
00:11:45	00:11:54	2	daycare centers recently uh-huh and um what i notice is that the group that they have between fifteen months and two and a half years 
00:11:54	00:11:59	1	they keep together yeah and um it's just that when you go in that section 
00:11:59	00:12:06	2	that'll be good for him then because he'll have a little bit of time with the younger kids to get yeah to it and then he'll be able to go with the older kids 
00:12:06	00:12:10	1	oh definitely definitely 'cause then then it's between two and a half three and a half 
00:12:16	00:12:19	1	it's funny when you go into the younger group it just doesn't seem like much going on 
00:12:19	00:12:42	2	they can't do as much as they don't do it but it's not real colorful and it has <unk> projects around and there's a lot of beds around because er mattresses 'cause they they have to nap and and um there's just too too much but it's so funny and then the rolls sick they're all like uh dozes or rather not everywhere like uh uh 
00:12:42	00:12:44	1	you know it 
00:12:46	00:12:48	1	just want him to 
00:12:48	00:12:58	2	in the last one i went to he really seemed to like you just had a lot to do you know like right from the start you start playing in the back yard and looking at the kids and being a bit more interest 
00:12:58	00:12:59	1	hello 
00:12:59	00:13:04	2	yeah i think it's a good idea well we don't know what we're going to do yet we haven't decided 
00:13:04	00:13:07	1	that's right 'cause you're going to take a certain type of work right yeah i get sick 
00:13:07	00:13:11	2	months and then after that we're going to be able to figure out what's going on 
00:13:11	00:13:13	1	can you go back to work part time 
00:13:13	00:13:23	2	i can go back part time and then when we're hoping as i'll be part time and maybe norm can be a part time and that'd be great then we won't have to put the baby in daycare but um that we really right 
00:13:23	00:13:25	1	he really does not want the baby in daycare 
00:13:25	00:13:27	2	oh yeah 
00:13:27	00:13:29	1	just feels really strongly against 
00:13:32	00:13:46	1	[laughter] oh right i mean there is no way like maybe our inlaws or the same like i don't want her to i know she's going to tell me what to do and stuff but my guys just sell taking care of my kids like in another world 
00:13:46	00:13:56	2	it's funny though like you think that you're going to be able to you know like i know i know how i want to raise my child but you really you take a lot of advice people especially you know 
00:13:56	00:13:59	1	an experience mother you know about simple thing 
00:14:13	00:14:24	2	and now he doesn't need water yeah he has breast milk so sure enough <unk> does he was so miserable [laughter] we started trying it would just giving them some kevin guilty and 
00:14:24	00:14:26	1	it was great uh-huh 
00:14:33	00:14:38	2	um sort of uh i'd give him give him water um 
00:14:38	00:14:50	1	yeah sort of ah maybe in between like he's just had to feed you know or if you try to feed and now it's feeding you know he wants more he wants more breast milk and i'm thinking to myself well that's a bit early so my <unk> um just the water and that 
00:14:50	00:14:53	2	and when did you start that 
00:14:53	00:14:55	1	uh pretty much right away will yeah 
00:14:55	00:15:09	2	they say like in the books that says not to only given breast for like the first six weeks or something like that oh wait a second um he probably had it maybe week five is where we started traveling a bit [noise] maybe even slightly before that 
00:15:09	00:15:10	1	[noise] um 
00:15:10	00:15:21	2	and the other thing that i would do is that it's after the six weeks if tyson was if a child was um uh just doesn't not 
00:15:21	00:15:25	1	spied from breast milk mhm that i would give uh top up 
00:15:25	00:15:32	2	<unk> oh you mean the <unk> i'm not i'm not like i'm in nebraska feed but i don't want to be totally tied 
00:15:32	00:15:36	1	you know it depends on <unk> it depends on you supply like some women 
00:15:36	00:15:41	2	gorgeous <unk> absolutely a huge thing gorge i never <unk> you know like 
00:15:41	00:15:44	1	that particularly big when i saw yeah 
00:15:44	00:15:45	2	oh and also 
00:15:45	00:15:46	1	right afterwards 
00:15:46	00:15:49	2	well what would happen too is that tyson 
00:15:49	00:15:50	1	[noise] would 
00:15:50	00:15:56	2	sleep all the time on the breast what would happen is that he would feed for a very short 
00:15:56	00:15:56	1	to tell it 
00:16:03	00:16:06	2	oh yeah and i just never found that he was satisfied 
00:16:06	00:16:07	1	quiet 
00:16:07	00:16:17	2	he wasn't <unk> but it just it was never say she ate it and um so in the future or if if that happened again to me i would start supplements thing i'd uh 
00:16:17	00:16:19	1	um he's 
00:16:19	00:16:32	2	it'd be at christmas time with our <unk> you know that oh yeah maybe like six weeks old oh i want to be able to go now [laughter] i mean i want them to watch the baby in us to be able to go and do something 
00:16:32	00:16:33	1	well you <unk> especially if you if you 
00:16:33	00:16:38	2	end up i'm doing well was breastfeeding you can uh you can't oh i can pomp and leave 
00:16:38	00:16:47	1	yeah yeah because i had i couldn't do anything like that oh i tried i had all the <unk> i even rented an electrical one 
00:16:47	00:16:52	2	and i couldn't i couldn't extracted old [laughter] 
00:16:52	00:16:54	1	so um 
00:16:54	00:17:06	2	[noise] ah and then when i put tyson on formula i put 'em on goats milk and then he's now he's on soy milk and and listen he's he's great with so many kids have sensitivities <unk> tyson 
00:17:06	00:17:07	1	he's never sick 
00:17:07	00:17:12	2	that's good we're not we're not going to do cows milk 'cause normally is allergic and my brother was allergic 
00:17:12	00:17:15	1	right oh definitely don't 
00:17:15	00:17:15	2	no way we can go 
00:17:15	00:17:18	1	goats milk is the closest to 
00:17:18	00:17:21	2	mothers breast you can get we have a formula here 
00:17:21	00:17:24	1	which is really nice formula and um 
00:17:24	00:17:30	2	and then uh onto soy he's just on um on a particular brand of soy milk 
00:17:30	00:17:33	1	he's just he's great i mean it's a little bit expensive but 
00:17:33	00:17:37	2	like i say he's just so well i can't see putting him on 
00:17:37	00:17:38	1	the cows now 
00:17:38	00:17:44	2	no why bother me especially when you do 
00:17:44	00:17:49	1	yeah so like just things like that and i think um [noise] yeah probably 
00:17:49	00:17:57	2	probably as of the six weeks i'll tell you one thing it's so confining i even when we weren't holiday like you i mean you're gonna be in a little bit of a holiday i rented six week period 
00:17:57	00:17:59	1	we were just 
00:17:59	00:18:07	2	exactly it was i was miserable in that respect those there's a lot that we couldn't do and um i felt so guilty because 
00:18:07	00:18:08	1	alright 
00:18:08	00:18:14	2	christmas eve mhm i had a drink too much and it was better 
00:18:14	00:18:17	1	they don't actually get the alcohol

00:23:13	00:23:18	2	alright well that's that's fairly common it's pretty <unk> actually i i'd say your system there would be as good as it is 
00:23:18	00:23:21	1	<unk> um hold 
00:23:21	00:23:27	2	they don't do the syrians first like over there and i might even even if the baby's breach there's a chance that it would be doing 
00:23:27	00:23:29	1	<unk> here 
00:23:29	00:23:37	2	oh well if you had the choice if um i don't know uh you don't have a choice of private or 
00:23:37	00:23:40	1	no everything here is public there is no such thing 
00:23:40	00:23:54	2	but here i mean um yeah i mean reach reach <unk> delivery would would be hard would be very hard on you and i said hopefully like if if if there was any sort of choices asked for a c. section because it's also can be dangerous for the baby 
00:23:54	00:23:55	1	yeah 
00:23:55	00:24:02	2	but um no i had no drugs but the only thing is since i went from second second stage to transitional 
00:24:02	00:24:03	1	stage right 
00:24:03	00:24:14	2	um oh is it no first age to transition age and i i didn't realize that i was in a tradition i still thought it was first days because they hadn't evaluated maine 
00:24:14	00:24:19	1	good where are you for most of your labor or did you go to the hospital later 
00:24:19	00:24:27	2	as soon as my water broke okay so you you could have been having contraptions for a few days and not even known it you actually went in when your water bro 
00:24:27	00:24:33	1	my water broke i wasn't having much going on and and sure enough i die late it very quickly like like i got to the hospital 
00:24:33	00:24:48	2	and when we're very nonchalant with me because she says well honey you can't be too for you still smile it without having um contraction they went from five minutes apart to three minutes apart in the time i was in the car um so when i was there and then they 
00:24:48	00:24:50	1	put me into the shower 
00:24:54	00:24:55	1	i'm not here let's 
00:24:55	00:25:05	2	good ah because i always thought it was having problems because of the animal yeah and um and sure enough i was i was in transition i kept thinking to myself craig i'm going to have to speak to them 
00:25:05	00:25:07	1	drugs because this is 
00:25:07	00:25:16	2	very tasteful and um so but i had forgotten all about the gas mhm totally forgot about the gas and um as soon as i had some of the gas i felt much better 
00:25:16	00:25:23	1	okay well they probably um you were probably in first stage for a long time and didn't know it didn't really feel it 
00:25:44	00:25:51	2	and he has to be at my examinations list and i could do an internal exam if you want me to it 'cause it it might bring 
00:25:51	00:25:53	1	uh-huh so 
00:25:53	00:25:57	2	wipe on it and then the next day i had to go into <unk> to um 
00:25:57	00:26:03	1	[noise] for a few little hot monitored who wants to make sure everything's okay and he was so surprised he 
00:26:03	00:26:17	2	i'm really surprised that that didn't do anything he was just really really surprised i went home and then within an hour of that that's what i oh okay that's what i thought oh this one is um or what is broke 
00:26:17	00:26:20	1	what happened was um did you have to get in a p._c. outta me 
00:26:20	00:26:23	2	yeah that's good did they did you terror 
00:26:23	00:26:27	1	i i like what's called grazed i tore a little bit on the 
00:26:27	00:26:32	2	god that's really good it was great god you were made to have be 
00:26:32	00:26:36	1	oh man well i wasn't i was it uh i did so miserable with um 
00:26:50	00:26:51	1	oh yeah 
00:26:51	00:26:59	2	i can totally understand i had like the most miserable i wasn't as sick as you but i was so miserable there is no way i could do anything or anybody or 
00:26:59	00:27:02	1	oh i wanted to do it like for me 
00:27:02	00:27:06	2	like what i can't imagine as having one kid at home and being morning sick 
00:27:06	00:27:08	1	it was awful 
00:27:08	00:27:19	2	<unk> yes and and and even now i'm surprised when i think about that first march is when i watch the tenth that i started getting sick 
00:27:19	00:27:22	1	[noise] and um 
00:27:22	00:27:25	2	i was so miserable that whole month of it was really full 
00:27:25	00:27:28	1	and it was the busiest month at work ever 
00:27:28	00:27:37	2	and we turned away business and i would i would finish up um early <unk> no no no couldn't take any more patients at the end of the day 
00:27:37	00:27:39	1	we've finished by five 
00:27:49	00:27:57	2	oh just you know i'd get sort of get the job done just go in there just leave because i'd have to as soon as they would pull him out and started smoking i feel nauseated 
00:28:06	00:28:10	1	is what like how do you adjust to people how do you stand for that long 
00:28:10	00:28:16	2	oh that actually that was okay i i did pretty well with that i didn't i'm standing ill 'cause i walk i walk 
00:28:16	00:28:23	1	i can look fun like i could walk for hours that would be okay except i can't walk fast because i get contractions when we walk fast oh right 
00:28:23	00:28:26	2	now i can i can walk and then um 
00:28:26	00:28:31	1	just seeing was pretty easy if i had to do was buy posture just went on a somebody that would be 
00:28:31	00:28:41	2	little bit awkward uh-huh 'cause i can't stand up i stand for like ten minutes that's it if i walk you know i can walk for half an hour or whatever it doesn't matter but the thing is is no good 
00:28:41	00:28:46	1	now the second time around though it might be a little bit different for me because um 
00:28:46	00:28:50	2	you just you show a lot quicker you know bigger 
00:28:50	00:28:51	1	tell me anyway and yeah 
00:28:51	00:29:03	2	and like this woman um <unk> thing right now at the office she's helping us our computer she's just she hasn't game very much weight she said she'd only gained six kilos mhm but um 
00:29:03	00:29:06	1	she's um she's just really awkward in or something 
00:29:06	00:29:07	2	you know like 
00:29:07	00:29:09	1	just really sort of 
00:29:09	00:29:22	2	full and she still has well she has another four weeks to go which technically i would be stopping market about this time though i think i was going to try and push it to just stopping two weeks before [laughter] i try and do as much as i can because 
00:29:22	00:29:23	1	[noise] to get a logan 
00:29:23	00:29:25	2	we just you know it's just 
00:29:29	00:29:39	2	yeah yeah and what about when you took off afterwards where you like incredibly board [noise] um yeah it's funny you days would ghosts 
00:29:39	00:29:40	1	<unk> mhm 
00:29:40	00:29:52	2	because you're just trying to get certain things done you didn't like it was a challenge to get all the stuff done for tyson during the day to do the <unk> because we do a close knit 
00:29:52	00:29:56	1	but i was going to ask to is was it just got to have to wash 'em 
00:29:56	00:29:59	2	[noise] no not really that really just up and
