00:12:32	00:12:34	2	wondering if it's the same as ours 
00:12:34	00:12:36	1	oh i i don't know because 
00:12:36	00:12:45	2	i don't think it is some a lot of it or not a lot of it but some of it has to do with just like the uh music directors preferences uh-huh and i don't know what all else 
00:12:45	00:12:49	1	well same with us but i was just wondering like you know are they the same time 
00:12:49	00:12:53	2	same bans if it's like all college radio i guess yeah 
00:12:53	00:12:56	1	mm i don't know [noise]

00:13:40	00:13:41	1	numbers in the universe and all this 
00:13:41	00:13:52	2	and we think we we deducted that like nothing people ever do could possibly be random 'cause it's all like oh my goodness um they're going to say no do you where do you eat do you just eat and you 
00:13:52	00:13:55	1	um mostly i have five meals i eat dinner 
00:13:55	00:14:00	2	at the common uh-huh but other than that i just chow down in here

00:14:02	00:14:14	2	oh it's all right um [noise] i don't know i just keep kind of basic stuff i haven't done any fancy cooking in one night we made this cool cool meal like george made something called honey does on chicken he was like 
00:14:14	00:14:17	1	cooking this chicken all day and then um 
00:14:17	00:14:24	2	i <unk> i fix this pasta with <unk> sauce like you should've seen her at the grocery store she she's like it's like uh

00:14:25	00:14:37	2	and she was like searching for just the right cheese like going nutty and then she got the cheese and it was really good mhm i think it was really fattening you could help that cheese in it and like cream and butter and stuff 
00:14:51	00:14:54	1	baked beans yesterday yeah for dinner yesterday 
00:14:54	00:14:57	2	i had baked beans and i had 
00:14:57	00:14:58	1	i cut up and 
00:14:58	00:15:00	2	like a bell pepper and 
00:15:21	00:15:30	2	a little bit again potluck basically i said term though like achieve all kind of word jeeze <unk> definitely it's 
00:15:30	00:15:35	1	potluck type of thing [laughter] 
00:15:35	00:15:44	2	i was thinking you know like some of the things we have at home like when my mom makes like um pork but with um like potatoes and cabbage i'm like what anyone else really want to eat 
00:15:44	00:15:46	1	probably just me 
00:15:46	00:15:51	2	or or sometimes my dad makes like roasts pork with sour cat i love that it's 
00:15:51	00:15:54	1	so good i mean it ever 
00:16:06	00:16:15	1	how how could you be allergic to chicken [laughter] what's in chicken you'd be alert 
00:16:15	00:16:25	2	i don't know but every time he eats chicken nugget all eyes or something holy shit that's so then so like so they i guess harris eats kosher so he wouldn't eat pork and he wouldn't need shellfish 
00:16:25	00:16:29	1	oh what is though like the september little things 
00:16:29	00:16:39	2	oh <unk> that's what i thought like that's that's next week at the yeah not this week or next week uh-huh and then <unk> like nine days after that or something 
00:16:39	00:16:43	1	okay yeah well the girl next door to me is jewish but she's not really a devout jew
