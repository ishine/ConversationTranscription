00:01:49	00:01:50	1	uh-huh 
00:01:50	00:01:56	2	so it worked out really well the ceremony was great and then then we went out in the garden <unk> 
00:01:56	00:02:02	1	um not being part of the universe i can't remember <unk> 
00:02:02	00:02:03	2	no it doesn't matter 
00:02:03	00:02:04	1	that's good 
00:02:04	00:02:06	2	do you and turns will marry anybody 
00:02:27	00:02:32	2	we played softball and uh volleyball and four square and 
00:02:32	00:02:33	1	dancing and 
00:02:33	00:02:34	2	music and great 
00:02:34	00:02:39	1	oh that sounds like a lot of fun it was oh sounds like it was great 
00:02:39	00:02:51	2	right yeah everybody a lot of people told us as opposed to letting it ever been to and that's i guess the highest compliment [laughter] [laughter] wow so did you guys go on a honeymoon 
00:03:01	00:03:06	2	we got this book from my mom about the caribbean and um i'd always wanting to go 
00:03:06	00:03:09	1	and so we decided okay well go we only went for five days 
00:03:18	00:03:23	2	he's twenty four rooms and and they said in the book like you won't be able to tell the guests from the staff and 
00:03:23	00:03:25	1	um it 
00:03:25	00:03:27	2	it was really really cold and they have you know it 
00:03:27	00:03:29	1	mismatch sheets and stuff it wasn't 
00:03:29	00:03:36	2	fancy at all but it was really cheap and they just had the bar open all the time you could go and get whatever you wanted and just write it on your guests 
00:03:36	00:03:38	1	get and they picked fresh mangoes 
00:03:38	00:03:40	2	from the yard for breakfast and stuff 
00:03:43	00:03:53	2	who's really tiny so the island it's only ten miles long um but it was it was good 'cause it you know everybody speaks english and and yet it's still pretty exotic 
00:03:53	00:03:54	1	you know 
00:03:56	00:04:01	1	it sounds great that's one thing i really regret is that norm and i didn't have a honeymoon 
00:04:01	00:04:04	2	yeah well you should go on one anyway 
00:04:04	00:04:09	1	planning on going one on one one of these days but i don't know now it's going to happen 
00:04:09	00:04:20	2	well i think it would be really funny if we go right now and people were going on or how big are you um well actually i've only gained four pounds 
00:04:20	00:04:21	1	uh-huh but is it 
00:04:21	00:04:26	2	uh for you know for how far i am but um i'm definitely pregnant 
00:04:26	00:04:29	1	[laughter] and a half 
00:04:44	00:04:49	1	further apart and kinda waste myself up sort of thing uh-huh 
00:04:49	00:04:55	2	it's pretty funny yeah i'm definitely pregnant but i'm not huge by any means but 
00:04:55	00:04:57	1	five and a half months now yeah 
00:04:57	00:05:07	2	so it's it's just starting to get into the part where you start to show and uh-huh start to get big and all but but it's weird like you go like um 
00:05:15	00:05:17	2	[laughter] me 
00:05:17	00:05:21	1	i've never really like being a close to her pregnant 
00:05:29	00:05:30	1	but 
00:05:30	00:05:38	2	you can see the line of your uterus you can see in your stomach where it is it's like this big circle and it sticks out and ethics 
00:05:38	00:05:40	1	and it's filling up with it 
00:05:40	00:05:42	2	yeah an alien 
00:05:42	00:05:43	1	totally what 
00:05:43	00:05:46	2	really does it move around yeah yeah 
00:05:46	00:05:54	1	he kicks a lot i don't i don't know that it's easy but i call them he he takes a lot he's been kicking for about five weeks now 
00:05:54	00:06:04	2	huh but um he just started this week he started rolling that i can feel i mean they roll the whole time but now i can feeling rolling and it's totally bizarre 
00:06:04	00:06:08	1	do you have a name for i mean like uh you know a joke name that you'd call it 
00:06:08	00:06:16	2	no i've heard some really good ones [laughter] that i came up with with bumper 'cause he just kick so much <unk> active 
00:06:16	00:06:19	1	well that's good yeah 
00:06:19	00:06:23	2	oh so the monster child is the other things in common 
00:06:23	00:06:27	1	[laughter] i was married baby [laughter] 
00:06:27	00:06:31	2	cause he kicks them much it's really you know it's really annoying 
00:06:31	00:06:32	1	get wake you up 
00:06:32	00:06:40	2	no he hasn't woke me up yeah but if i wake up in the middle of the night he is he does kick <unk> so you can feeling kicking in the middle of the night if 
00:06:40	00:06:42	1	uh well if it's a girl 
00:06:42	00:06:52	2	well it's probably not a girl because in our family it's like if you go on both sides of our family and you look at all our first cousins and everything it's like seventy five percent males 
00:06:52	00:06:53	1	huh 
00:07:15	00:07:18	1	[noise] we went and looked up all this research there's 
00:07:18	00:07:32	2	this stuff you'll see when you get pregnant and if if you wanna know just send me email 'cause i looked up a bunch of stuff but there's all this research like on there's all different kinds of prenatal tests that you can get now it's not just <unk> it's like other stuff too 
00:07:32	00:07:33	1	uh-huh 
00:07:33	00:07:35	2	and then there's also um 
00:07:35	00:07:37	1	you know the the er the old 
00:07:37	00:07:49	2	<unk> but in fact like if you look at the <unk> the latest research on ultrasound it's like they really don't know like they assume that it's safe because you know they've had it for twenty years 
00:07:49	00:07:51	1	right and nothing ever happened 
00:07:51	00:08:03	2	well they don't know they've never really done any big studies on it or anything but but if you're a normal low like there's reasons to have an ultrasound and if you have to have an older son than it's a really good diagnosed 
00:08:03	00:08:04	1	oh right right 
00:08:04	00:08:16	2	but in a normal lower <unk> pregnancy like mind it's not a good diagnostic tool at all like they find as many um false positives as they do false negative for 
00:08:16	00:08:18	1	first sign of evidence that well 
00:08:18	00:08:26	2	thing they can really check they can check the heart uh-huh and then they can check to see if the baby has a brain and then [laughter] 
00:08:26	00:08:27	1	it'd be a good idea 
00:08:27	00:08:31	2	we can do some measurements to see if the baby have um 
00:08:31	00:08:33	1	oh that's amazing 
00:08:33	00:08:51	2	like down's syndrome like sometimes but that's not really very good like <unk> the only sure way to find out right it could give you like some indications that the baby might have downs or something it's really not a very good diagnostic told at all for people with low risk pregnancy so i didn't bother getting 
00:08:51	00:08:51	1	mhm 
00:09:02	00:09:06	2	[noise] i i've met like three people since i got pregnant where the 
00:09:09	00:09:13	2	named bored of it they hadn't well it's not called abortion it's called term 
00:09:13	00:09:15	1	nation that's right 
00:09:15	00:09:24	2	i just i just couldn't have done that i just we talked about it a little bit you know what i mean like obviously i don't want my baby to have a mental defects or anything like that but 
00:09:24	00:09:26	1	but if it does 
00:09:26	00:09:35	2	could not have done that so it wasn't worth doing the prenatal testing because you know if you're not going to a board anyway then there's no no habit 
00:09:41	00:09:48	2	but then i figured well i'll just go through the nine months of pregnancy and then the baby will die and when i was born you know if it's like 
00:09:48	00:09:55	1	[noise] we had this friend is is not supposed to scare you it's just 'cause it's on the topic but um but the baby died at like eight and a half 
00:09:55	00:09:59	2	i know i read so many of the <unk> just freaked me out 
00:09:59	00:10:01	1	of course they make you have give birth 
00:10:01	00:10:04	2	anyway you know i have a new i mean i mean that's how you 
00:10:04	00:10:12	1	have an abortion you give birth and said no it's dead and it's a hassle you know and you've got to go through all that pain knowing the babies and i don't even know alive anyway but 
00:10:12	00:10:16	2	you know she's pregnant again you know they're fine 
00:10:16	00:10:17	1	until the day 
00:10:17	00:10:21	2	i think it got either strangle by quarter some kind of 
00:10:21	00:10:23	1	but they they always say that 
00:10:23	00:10:43	2	say that accident then yeah you know something happen or or maybe it it went into oxygen deficiency or something like something happened to her and she was asleep at the time and so she didn't even know it until the next morning and it was something like that 
00:10:43	00:10:44	1	that is so scary 
00:10:44	00:10:54	2	but obviously you know when you have a baby for the rest of its life in your life you have to worry that it might die you know or somebody will happen to 
00:10:54	00:10:55	1	scary it's awful 
00:10:55	00:10:57	2	that's gotta be the worst thing 
00:10:57	00:11:00	1	what do you how did you get to meet your nephew at your uh 
00:11:00	00:11:04	2	i did the baby is huge 
00:11:04	00:11:06	1	he's four months and he's like eighteen 
00:11:06	00:11:07	2	yeah 
00:11:07	00:11:10	1	but it's all 
00:11:10	00:11:20	2	[laughter] he's he's he's he's the shape of a of a small baby but he's been [laughter] that'd be 
00:11:20	00:11:24	1	oh you better hope that that doesn't run in the family well let's see when he was born 
00:11:28	00:11:29	1	okay yeah but um 
00:11:29	00:11:32	2	my brother my uncle is like six foot 
00:11:32	00:11:40	1	four and my brothers big and on gail inside of the family there's big people too so i mean he could just be big bully [laughter] 
00:11:54	00:11:56	1	he just way's he's hefty 
00:11:56	00:12:02	2	yeah well they don't you know they just tell your feet on demand i mean if they want to eat that much you let them eat 
00:12:02	00:12:06	1	and and he's healthy and all you know it's like 
00:12:06	00:12:23	2	do they seem happy oh they're really happy they're really happy it was kinda stressful coming all the way out here with the little one but so when they got back it was kind of kind of exhausting to them um oh the <unk> everybody you know couldn't get their hands off baby jack he was a star the wedding 
00:12:23	00:12:25	1	yeah yeah 
00:12:29	00:12:36	2	[laughter] i know but i think we're gonna go back to like plan a and and start trying in october when you're given birth 
00:12:36	00:12:38	1	hey well you know maybe 
00:12:40	00:12:44	1	you up right before i go into labor they now's the time 
00:12:44	00:12:50	2	if my cycles are regular as they as they you know as regular as they have been and um 
00:12:50	00:12:53	1	like <unk> around the end of the month so 
00:12:53	00:12:59	2	oh yeah so it would be it would be the halloween baby yeah wow 
00:12:59	00:13:03	1	maybe like mine would get the spirit of yours or something like the 
00:13:10	00:13:12	2	i know yeah so what about 
00:13:12	00:13:14	1	davis and had her baby 
00:13:14	00:13:15	2	she did well 
00:13:15	00:13:18	1	yep jonathan david 
00:13:18	00:13:22	2	oh i didn't really she was that much more ahead of me i thought she was just a few months 
00:13:24	00:13:31	2	wow wow <unk> a good time when with the baby do if you and then you'd have all venue 
00:13:31	00:13:36	1	all three who lie or be do this time next year 
00:13:36	00:13:41	2	yeah and then you'd be pregnant all through the winter so that's good you should start training earlier 
00:13:56	00:13:57	1	right 
00:13:57	00:14:00	2	[noise] so there's that would be that would be actually 
00:14:00	00:14:06	1	no it's eight weeks they'll let you travel up to eight weeks so eight weeks before you do 
00:14:06	00:14:08	2	month yeah yeah 
00:14:08	00:14:10	1	to travel on till thirty two weeks 
00:14:10	00:14:14	2	and but it's even driving distance it's in new york so even uh oh yeah 
00:14:19	00:14:22	2	the end <unk> thirty seven you could drive 
00:14:22	00:14:24	1	up to the hospital i mean you can 
00:14:24	00:14:34	2	right you just have to stop every two hours and get out and stretch your legs yeah so and there's no reason to believe you wouldn't have a normal low risk pregnant 
00:14:34	00:14:40	1	i know i'm healthy in gyms and not as healthy as i am but i mean for the little sperm i don't think it matters 
00:14:40	00:14:48	2	well have you know you want to get pregnant now's the time to start changing your lifestyle [laughter] i know well that really sorry about that 
00:14:48	00:14:54	1	you really cannot smoke i know you're pregnant and it's going to take a while to get used to it so 
00:14:54	00:14:59	2	[noise] and um they do say that you can drink caffeine they 
00:14:59	00:15:08	1	dr seem to have no problem with that although i actually quit drinking caffeine when i found out [noise] but um i like to two cups a day or something like 
00:15:08	00:15:15	2	that the main thing i want to make sure that i'm off at <unk> and then yeah 'cause it's 
00:15:15	00:15:16	1	to be getting that it's sad 
00:15:16	00:15:19	2	like i would stop smoking pot a couple of months before 
00:15:19	00:15:21	1	i don't do that 
00:15:21	00:15:22	2	you don't 
00:15:22	00:15:24	1	oh yeah 
00:15:24	00:15:35	2	oh sorry [laughter] such an idiot [laughter] [laughter] oh well 
00:15:35	00:15:38	1	yeah i'm <unk> one one should yes 
00:15:38	00:15:46	2	i agree i i <unk> um so [laughter] 
00:15:46	00:15:54	1	anyhow um so uh yeah and the other thing that that you should do is like start trying to drink more milk no because you're supposed 
00:16:11	00:16:16	2	[noise] it doesn't really matter you know it's no big deal like eating habits are really no big deal for the first three months because 
00:16:16	00:16:18	1	basically what happens is it's 
00:16:18	00:16:19	2	it's totally true when you said 
00:16:25	00:16:35	2	mhm well stealing from you so what will happen for instance if you don't get enough milk when you're pregnant as the baby i'll take the calcium from your bones and you'll end up with us 
00:16:35	00:16:38	1	protests when you're an old person 
00:16:40	00:16:46	1	and that's the same thing with like protein and stuff he'll take the protein from your muscles and uh-huh 
00:17:05	00:17:07	1	wow uh-huh yeah so 
00:17:19	00:17:20	1	relatively 
00:17:24	00:17:33	1	but if you run marathons before you can continue jogging until your fifth or six months so you know you ride your bike all the time you can continue riding your bike and 
00:17:33	00:17:40	2	yeah i ride my bike every day and david and said she she job for the first three months and then as soon as it her fourth month she had to go to walking 
00:17:40	00:17:41	1	uh-huh 
00:17:55	00:17:56	1	walk 
00:17:56	00:18:02	2	i mean i'd go outside and i'd go for a walk and i'd go like five steps and i'd feel like bar thing 
00:18:02	00:18:09	1	i know [laughter] like it was so disgusting v. morning sick as like the most disgusting things 
00:18:09	00:18:15	2	i was sick when i was pregnant before i was pregnant before yeah terminated it yeah 
00:18:15	00:18:16	1	mhm 
00:18:16	00:18:18	2	well then you'll probably be <unk> 
00:18:18	00:18:20	1	too i know 
00:18:53	00:18:59	1	oh god [laughter] [laughter] i don't know what it's like it but i 
00:18:59	00:19:00	2	oh it's miserable 
00:19:00	00:19:03	1	really how's norm doing about thinking about being a phone 
00:19:03	00:19:16	2	oh i don't know we don't really you know he [noise] he seems to accept it pretty well but i i don't think he really has much clue about what it's going to be like 'cause like i was talking the other day you know he's working now so um 
00:19:16	00:19:17	1	what's he doing 
00:19:17	00:19:32	2	he's working at being our is doing interface design stuff that's great yeah it's the same kinda job like i send you the uh microsoft post right but it's it's um a local job mhm so anyhow he's not really going to have much time when the baby gets more than like maybe have a few 
00:19:45	00:19:48	1	way too much but 
00:19:48	00:19:50	2	he can just 
00:19:50	00:19:52	1	wake up and go back to sleep and 
00:19:52	00:19:58	2	yeah yeah some people do like i was talking to him one of my friends here at work and he said that you know after the first week 
00:20:12	00:20:13	1	kinds of decisions 
00:20:23	00:20:25	1	i know 
00:20:25	00:20:28	2	wow and give him my experience i started a new all the tricks 
00:20:28	00:20:30	1	mhm 
00:20:30	00:20:35	2	feels great montana or just relax and have a good time with it 
00:20:35	00:20:47	1	oh yeah i'm not really concerned at all i know i'm not you know i'm not making any decisions or anything 'cause it's so hard to know what you're gonna feel like i know like lots of people said they were going to breastfeed and then it turns out they could 
00:20:47	00:20:51	2	speed or you're going to <unk> 
00:20:51	00:20:58	1	yeah i'm going to try it's hard it's not easy mhm but you know if you have the right kind of support then

00:24:23	00:24:29	1	britain is going to have cat these jobs she's going to hire someone else's <unk> as a research assistant so that leaves the post doc salary that we have which is 
00:24:52	00:24:57	2	you know it's all up in the air but we're just gonna try to stay here germs lobbying for a raise

00:25:19	00:25:24	1	if things work out then you know it would be nice to stay here for now 'cause we got this cheap place to live 
00:25:24	00:25:29	2	yeah um my word for it it's much more expensive here yeah 
00:25:29	00:25:37	1	oh most places it's much more expensive we have a huge place that we could downsize even paid less than we're paying now and it was perfectly comfortably 
00:25:37	00:25:38	2	[noise] 
00:25:38	00:25:41	1	um or by place a small place 
00:25:41	00:26:01	2	yeah yeah you could easily by a place and we know what see the thing is is that if you get a job and then you get pregnant right away well in some places you might be able to go to have time but you know if you get a job you have to work at a place for over a year before you're even allowed six weeks maternity leave 
00:26:01	00:26:03	1	basically quitting when the baby was born 
00:26:05	00:26:07	1	you get six months yeah 
00:26:07	00:26:14	2	six months and four of those months we'll be full pay wow those months we'll be at sixty five percent of pay 
00:26:14	00:26:15	1	wow 
00:26:15	00:26:19	2	and then i um and then if i want i can go back to work half time 
00:26:19	00:26:21	1	wow so 
00:26:21	00:26:30	2	but i might go back to work fulltime i normally i don't know what'll happen it it depends on what's going on with his work too right now he's only on a six month contract 
00:26:30	00:26:32	1	so he could be mr mom then and you 
00:26:32	00:26:39	2	yeah that's one of the things we're talking about we we don't want to put the baby in daycare until he's at least a year old yeah that'd be good 
00:26:39	00:26:42	1	yeah so that's another thing to think about it you know 
00:26:52	00:27:03	2	so i might as well go for it and and has been trying for over a year and so her stories don't put it off you know just go for it if you want to have a bad yeah well i agree with that i mean you know 
00:27:03	00:27:04	1	uh <unk> 
00:27:04	00:27:16	2	<unk> you know you know that that's what you want so just go for it and and there are problems associated with wait until you're older i mean incidence of birth defects are down's syndrome increases at i'm bigger than it increases 
00:27:16	00:27:22	1	i'm just worried about gyms energy level he needs to be able to you know he's old 
00:27:22	00:27:29	2	true so and you know if if the you know that that fits you want and there's no reason not to go ahead and 
00:27:41	00:27:45	1	kids that pregnancy and when it posted like the birth story 
00:27:45	00:27:49	2	their baby you know uh-huh i mean i read it and i was like crying at the end 
00:27:49	00:27:51	1	it's just like the most 
00:27:51	00:27:59	2	false thing you know and then other times i'm just like oh my god what did i do or life is going to change so much i yeah i don't want a baby i'm not ready for it 
00:27:59	00:28:00	1	uh-huh 
00:28:00	00:28:06	2	so you know you just you just do whatever feelings you have you know it's just 
00:28:06	00:28:07	1	mhm 
00:28:07	00:28:09	2	it's it's not going to um 
00:28:09	00:28:15	1	but you're gonna have mixed feelings if you get pregnant now if you get pregnant a year from now if you get pregnant and ten years from now 
00:28:15	00:28:17	2	mhm 
00:28:17	00:28:17	1	you know

00:28:40	00:28:41	1	mean norm 
00:28:41	00:28:49	2	just amazing thing in the world like the baby's gonna be both of us you know it's totally bizarre to me that that's true 
00:28:49	00:28:54	1	it's weird i know and mine's going to be so smart and so beautiful 
00:28:54	00:28:55	2	[laughter]

00:29:22	00:29:32	2	no i doubt it i think she's trying to exercise and take care of herself and stuff and not have so much stress as she is too but 
00:29:33	00:29:36	2	she gets migraines you know she'd stress could it 
00:29:36	00:29:37	1	uh-huh
