00:18:19	00:18:21	1	fairly greedy i said they were 
00:18:21	00:18:25	2	requisite the first one is that 
00:18:25	00:18:33	1	service being rendered be done because of a commitment you christ mhm and um the jesuit hussein that to me 
00:18:57	00:19:06	2	i have seen you know that just it's very i i took it literally and i had the you know i said to jackie this is very important and we didn't 
00:19:06	00:19:08	1	take some people because of that

00:19:39	00:19:47	2	[noise] and not change that with jackie and i think it might may be it would be important that people knew that mhm 
00:19:47	00:19:48	1	oh this is great 
00:19:48	00:19:54	2	well i mean it's great for me i'm i'm using your phone call here on divided oh good 
00:19:54	00:19:57	1	well just tell me a little bit about your <unk> 
00:19:57	00:20:03	2	said to me in your in your let her know pray for my uh postulate too do you mean with the girls 
00:20:03	00:20:07	1	well basically in the college yeah um but 
00:20:07	00:20:10	2	i there are a couple of things that i wanted to 
00:20:14	00:20:18	2	for women who made this century prayer retreat 
00:20:18	00:20:20	1	i read that sure in your letter okay 
00:20:24	00:20:26	1	okay 
00:20:26	00:20:33	2	she sometimes she teaches about third grade maybe yes and sometimes she brings the children 
00:20:33	00:20:35	1	to this fail a gray area where you are 
00:20:35	00:20:37	2	oh okay so 
00:20:48	00:20:51	1	yeah to speak and she became a little bit emotional 
00:20:51	00:20:59	2	yeah and she said she really wished you could talk more about her experience but she couldn't because she was more comfortable 
00:20:59	00:21:01	1	spanish yeah okay 
00:21:01	00:21:03	2	and so when i 
00:21:03	00:21:05	1	[noise] say goodbye to her and everything 
00:21:05	00:21:09	2	you know she spoke as if she would be meeting you at some 
00:21:09	00:21:14	1	yeah okay and i told her um i didn't i wasn't setting you up 
00:21:14	00:21:29	2	to be a spiritual director or anything but i did say toward that if she were to talk if she felt that she wanted to talk about her perry experience in spanish that you would probably be able to certainly to understand but to empathize a little bit with what you know 
00:21:30	00:21:37	2	yeah so i wanted to tell you that i said that okay now do do did you give me her number in that letter 
00:21:37	00:21:39	1	[noise] i don't think so no okay
