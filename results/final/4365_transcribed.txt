00:00:00	00:00:01	2	mhm 
00:00:01	00:00:02	1	i guess that's it 
00:00:02	00:00:11	2	well we'll talk about the president [laughter] no i talked to dug up so i guess well the well the thing is is kind of annoying me a little bit 
00:00:13	00:00:33	2	of all well i i i think he's sort of knew he didn't i didn't want him to be here yeah it was still he uh was someplace to bring people it's like how long are you going to be here uh-huh so i really don't think that it's very appropriate or so forth like you're on vacation i mean what what's the point yeah and it's a sort of <unk> that that might of annoys me it's kind of uh <unk> what's that 
00:00:33	00:00:35	1	you know why he wants to bring people 
00:00:35	00:00:36	2	right right 
00:01:02	00:01:03	1	[noise] oh 
00:01:07	00:01:09	1	i don't care i'll show whenever i please 
00:01:09	00:01:18	2	so anyway and then anyway we're supposed to do something with the air i mentioned <unk> when we get together with eric or something friday uh-huh you know that's you know go out to movies 
00:01:18	00:01:21	1	for the one that she was <unk> we we just relax 
00:01:21	00:01:29	2	yeah but the thing is is that he never calls never does anything okay and so all i get now as it gets the message well 
00:01:29	00:01:30	1	mhm 
00:01:30	00:01:38	2	i want to get a hold of the key when can i get it wants me to straighten up or something it's like i'm not gonna straighten up for this can be accurate <unk> i'm sorry 
00:01:38	00:01:39	1	[laughter] 
00:01:39	00:01:47	2	and it just it just sort of annoys me yeah you know if you want to do do any of that other stuff just go somewhere else yeah 
00:01:47	00:01:50	1	no no i just think it's bullshit i mean that's i'm sorry but it's 
00:01:50	00:01:52	2	i know i just think you're getting 
00:01:52	00:02:02	1	no i i'm sorry i don't get time france crap okay that's about it okay i i have to feed some animals now worried about that now and then this other 
00:02:02	00:02:05	2	well i'll be sharing over that what's that i use thing over there 
00:02:05	00:02:07	1	uh i'm thinking about it 
00:02:07	00:02:12	2	yeah well then why not i just wish you had mentioned to me before you offer 
00:02:12	00:02:13	1	i did 
00:02:13	00:02:17	2	well i was kind of thing i was kind of hesitant 
00:02:17	00:02:26	1	i don't know if you asked me you mentioned it and then it came to discussion after you've mentioned it to do but beforehand that kind of been kind of like negative on it 
00:02:26	00:02:39	2	[noise] i don't know i just i guess i never really thought that it would be that big a deal you know well i mean i i i just think that it's largely because you're in a really high stress 
00:02:39	00:02:43	1	i'm in a situation where i need full control my environment i know 
00:02:43	00:02:53	2	so i was just died and then no but anyway he doesn't call and i just all i <unk> i mean friday and always get this <unk> own a key i mean talking about a little bit rude i'm sorry 
00:02:56	00:02:59	2	you for something here i don't think it's 
00:02:59	00:03:10	1	well i think the behavior indicates that at least at least at least you know mr mr mr very sensitive and aware of other people's behavior is obviously not super aware of his own a little bit so 
00:03:10	00:03:17	2	well yeah but you know that he acts abrupt like that anyway right 
00:03:28	00:03:36	1	supposed to do anything i'll take care of it i i am going to mention to him that i do think it was sort of rude that he didn't do that and all i get is this message blah you know 
00:03:36	00:03:41	2	yeah i mean i think it's valid for you to yell at him first and then you guys 
00:03:41	00:03:46	1	well it wasn't the official plan but it's not as if he gave me a number to contact them it 
00:03:58	00:04:11	2	i don't think so i was the one who suggested going out and doing something and the only thing he can be say put off by me is that in my life hangs in the balance and i would like to be left alone i don't think that that's unreasonable 
00:04:11	00:04:13	1	yeah you know i you know it's 
00:04:13	00:04:22	2	oh i know i agree but you know um also if you know uh you're not going to be there 
00:04:22	00:04:23	1	during the 
00:04:23	00:04:36	2	the way i kind of it it's like if you went to a soft place to lie your head down fall asleep and wake up cook food or whatever and putts around once in a while that's fine 
00:04:51	00:04:54	2	quite a while they'll say that they live somewhere [laughter] 
00:04:54	00:04:57	1	you know what i'm saying 
00:04:57	00:05:07	2	um not all of them i mean i get the impression not all of them can you go back to that place i mean have you ever actually talk to him about it 
00:05:07	00:05:08	1	no but anyway 
00:05:08	00:05:12	2	well because some of them 
00:05:12	00:05:17	1	you know oh i understand i think i understand what you're saying though yeah i think i figured it out that 
00:05:17	00:05:28	2	so he would like to have a place where they can come visit him yeah and so and so 
00:05:28	00:05:29	1	it's fun 
00:05:29	00:05:32	2	never mind i thought uh hilarious workplace but anyway 
00:05:32	00:05:33	1	uh-huh 
00:05:33	00:05:45	2	i don't wanna say it's not it's not it's a it's a word play on what you just said which are already it's but it it it it it comes and it <unk> there's some truth to it you know 
00:05:45	00:05:46	1	uh-huh 
00:05:46	00:05:47	2	what is it 
00:05:55	00:06:01	2	yeah well okay [laughter] but i mean anyway 
00:06:01	00:06:04	1	anyway so my my my thought on them 
00:06:04	00:06:10	2	whole thing is that you know if if you visited him you wouldn't want to have to be 
00:06:10	00:06:11	1	you know 
00:06:11	00:06:28	2	spent panting and spending every second of the day with him only you know what i'm saying and that probably part of the reason that it would be nice to actually stay with them is that you could also go and visit the sites or whatever where <unk> in japan 
00:06:31	00:06:34	1	maybe in ten years but no time soon 
00:06:34	00:06:40	2	but no you know what i'm saying when you are visiting a town and you stay at someone's house 
00:06:44	00:06:53	2	well i don't mind he does stuff on my his own i just uh you know i mean there's a difference between guest and there's a difference between ownership i think i think that 
00:06:53	00:06:55	1	i don't know there are i mean if if if i 
00:06:55	00:07:18	2	somewhere you know i can rearranged the furniture you would have been staying somewhere it doesn't mean i'm um i'm in jail i mean just because i'm in a motel doesn't mean i'm going to repaint the walls but it doesn't mean that um obligated to stay there either i'm just sitting there are different degrees of you know i don't think he's obligated to sit there and hobnobbing around with me the entire time either i wouldn't want him to yeah you know i told him i said no time to do anything and i 
00:07:20	00:07:27	2	as soon as i moved back here he's out i i i am so totally and since i don't care if you never talk to me again 
00:07:27	00:07:37	1	because there's no way i can study with worrying about keeping somebody awake or you know i'll have to worry a how <unk> um dressed if i'm clean you know whatever 
00:07:37	00:07:39	2	yeah well i i agree with that 
00:07:39	00:07:42	1	we do but in that case i think that 
00:07:51	00:07:55	2	to go make a coffee too [noise] [noise] wow 
00:07:55	00:08:00	1	you know what i'm saying and i'm kinda thinking about saying well here's he'd give me a couple of bucks a week ago 
00:08:00	00:08:07	2	yeah or just give him give him your side of the kids one day when you're studying and 
00:08:07	00:08:13	1	here and bring it back you know go make a copy and and bring it back and i mean i don't see that unreal 
00:08:13	00:08:30	2	well for him now for a key when i you know at least i anyway maybe not you have offered a long time ago that oh yes you can stay here and bloody blah <unk> he knows that you're not going to be there so i think that you know i i don't think that it's unreal 
00:08:30	00:08:46	1	yeah i just think he needs to know that there are limits or whatever that i don't want it i mean i'd like to be able to come here during the day any time and not feel like if i need a book or something uh-huh i don't wanna feel restrain because it'll frustrate me uh-huh and i will 
00:08:56	00:08:58	1	yeah you know 
00:09:09	00:09:20	2	like that i mean i don't think that's unreasonable you know or something like that yeah because then he can feel comfortable and you can feel comfortable because you know what's going on 
00:09:20	00:09:31	1	yeah you know and and plus you know you're going to be at uh suzanne for what 'til the eleventh or something 
00:09:39	00:09:41	1	right so and then 
00:09:41	00:09:43	2	so just 
00:09:43	00:09:46	1	but you'll be over here packing at that time partially 
00:09:46	00:09:48	2	partially true cause 
00:09:48	00:09:56	1	i deposited you rather rent blown traffic came in oh good how much but it was nineteen something okay 
00:09:56	00:10:10	2	it's easy thing is i took out two hundred and fifty how they count i'm going to pay the electric bill i'm going to pay m._b._n._a. i'm going to pay uh some other people okay and then there was like thirty five fifty thirty five it was like different 
00:10:10	00:10:12	1	i wrote to march checks you want me to give them 
00:10:12	00:10:13	2	no it doesn't matter 
00:10:13	00:10:15	1	they'll figure it out and we get back on 
00:10:15	00:10:16	2	i haven't done any cattle 
00:10:16	00:10:19	1	in all i've had cervical figures in my head 
00:10:19	00:10:20	2	no where everything is 
00:10:20	00:10:22	1	can do it very quickly 
00:10:22	00:10:24	2	but i just i just haven't 
00:10:36	00:10:48	2	i agree um um so i <unk> i was thinking of sending mom and dad um about a hundred bucks does that sound reasonable 
00:10:48	00:10:51	1	yeah for what off of what i owe them 
00:11:04	00:11:06	1	no i 
00:11:10	00:11:17	2	um 'cause actually i was i was thinking that in any case i think in some sense it'll be a learning experience and 
00:11:23	00:11:25	1	as far as what 
00:11:25	00:11:29	2	there would be anything any possibility 
00:11:30	00:11:39	2	well partially because he wanted some to train someone to do it long term and partially because he thought he might have enough people already and stuff like that 
00:11:39	00:11:40	1	okay well that's that's 
00:11:40	00:11:45	2	so you know i said okay well you know we can talk about it later and stuff like that but 
00:11:45	00:11:47	1	mhm not sound 
00:11:47	00:11:50	2	it just sounds like a kind of cool thing you could put on i know 
00:11:50	00:11:54	1	i know it sounds like a nice thing to do but i'm not sure that 
00:11:54	00:12:00	2	uh i'll be able to you know what i'm saying yeah um but i'll i'll definitely talk to me 
00:12:00	00:12:13	1	yeah 'cause we would be cool if it was only like five hours a week because it would be just enough so you could get <unk> crazed anyway you know oh i know i'm going to be teaching to classes and taking thirteen credits 
00:12:13	00:12:16	2	well he <unk> why don't you take <unk> twelve or ten or something 
00:12:16	00:12:17	1	well because 
00:12:17	00:12:24	2	one of the courses has a co requisite so it's four credit hours and the other ones they need and and uh you have it 
00:12:24	00:12:25	1	mhm 
00:12:34	00:12:35	1	living in the spring 
00:12:35	00:12:57	2	gotcha um package but i can't get it yet why 'cause the mail room window is close mm yeah i know get your surprise [laughter] you're going to take a nap today was came back from <unk> party and the head to head and stuff and i was able to say tired when i was up late last night with iraq talking to where he was fun to talk to 
00:12:57	00:13:00	1	no and i called you were still <unk> 
00:13:00	00:13:03	2	yeah so it should it for like three years wow 
00:13:03	00:13:06	1	um oh another thing i was talking to my 
00:13:06	00:13:08	2	<unk> mhm 
00:13:08	00:13:14	1	and um i don't think i've told you uh what they recommended about investment yet have they 
00:13:14	00:13:19	2	mhm um but i mean the thing is i'm going to worry about investment when we're out of debt 
00:13:19	00:13:29	1	no i know that but but my other moms um recommendation was that we should put two and a half that we should invest 
00:13:29	00:13:32	2	um even though it's about money because 
00:13:32	00:13:33	1	that gets 
00:13:33	00:13:36	2	so it started and you always put it off later no matter what 
00:13:38	00:13:54	2	recommendation was pay off the credit cards but then when they talked to me together on the phone that kind of came to this agreement that it would be the optimal situation would be to invest two hundred and fifty 
00:13:54	00:13:55	1	so it didn't pass 
00:13:55	00:14:05	2	and then have credit cards and once you've invested two hundred and fifty dollars and this one fund then you can send in small amounts whenever you want 
00:14:05	00:14:08	1	but you have to make a two hundred and fifty dollar initial investment 
00:14:08	00:14:11	2	yeah for it to make worth worthwhile for them too right 
00:14:11	00:14:13	1	and have it running through this hassle 
00:14:13	00:14:23	2	um yeah uh and i think that's a good idea i mean i'm really i think i really look forward to us trying to work a lot this spring i mean if you take one class and 
00:14:23	00:14:31	1	'cause if we don't get if yeah if we don't get close to out of debt i will not i refuse to go to europe i mean that's i mean um 
00:14:31	00:14:35	2	i know i'm sure i um i'm just saying 
00:14:35	00:14:39	1	you know it doesn't it to help that i have a fellowship oh i <unk> yeah 
00:14:39	00:14:45	2	i think it's i think it's wonderful that's why i'm thinking that there is an opportunity i think <unk> if we really 
00:14:45	00:14:47	1	everything correctly it can be done 
00:14:47	00:14:53	2	oh don't worry i'm not going to buy any stereo equipment i don't want to buy an easter i simply going to buy things which 
00:14:53	00:14:58	1	that we absolutely need or really help us in some special way right now and 
00:14:58	00:15:00	2	uh-huh so forth 
00:15:00	00:15:06	1	going out to a great elmer of all things talking talking about people that was going to i was thinking of i don't know why i thought about 
00:15:06	00:15:13	2	hi today uh well he was hanging around with this guy john who's in library science is and they were going out to the country to look at stars to tell us 
00:15:13	00:15:14	1	oh sounds like fun 
00:15:14	00:15:20	2	so it's pretty cool yeah but he's doing fine he popped by not too long ago and so forth 
00:15:22	00:15:24	2	[laughter] 
00:15:24	00:15:31	1	nice and all but i mean i think you know i like it to an extent i would like to know more but i would never want to be into it like he is it's just not me i'd rather read some 
00:15:38	00:15:51	2	that's a good um oh um the other thing i was gonna ask you about mom called earlier today and um i was talking to her and she was saying that um 
00:15:51	00:15:54	1	there is a uh that she was 
00:15:54	00:16:10	2	about gram in grand dead and she went over there to cut their lawn and stuff like that mhm and um so what i said is that i was hoping that you and i could get down there may be the first weekend after classes or um 
00:16:10	00:16:11	1	mhm 
00:16:11	00:16:18	2	you know those next couple of weekends to help them out with projects around the house that they've got 
00:16:18	00:16:20	1	you know and and um 
00:16:20	00:16:21	2	when i mentioned the smoke 
00:16:21	00:16:25	1	um um you know i said what 
00:16:25	00:16:40	2	think about something that you guys need help with you know so that we would come down for a weekend and just really <unk> yeah exactly and and you mentioned two things one of them was painting the fence out back and 
00:16:40	00:16:41	1	patio cover 
00:17:03	00:17:08	2	throw away your boyfriend mementos levy in large slew of them 
00:17:08	00:17:10	1	yeah sure right 
00:17:10	00:17:12	2	um anyway so 
00:17:12	00:17:17	1	but uh you know 'cause i've got so much stuff left over there i don't know what you think about that 
00:17:17	00:17:26	2	i think it's fine i think one of the first thing we shouldn't try to boxing's up get rid of that we don't want and get it all efficiently sort of way in that room for um mhm 
00:17:26	00:17:27	1	your parents are they 
00:17:27	00:17:30	2	use it for something right so 
00:17:30	00:17:42	1	i talked to in the <unk> the other day i was talking to touch yesterday we had a <unk> oh actually went in to keep his birthday party that's where i talk to her but uh uh the party with a lot of fun we were we were being really crazy these kids who are i think we're kind of weird 
00:17:42	00:17:54	2	[laughter] all of us for just we're being we were laughing really hard we were being it was just a lot of puns we we're making we're just kind of it's sort of sort of like if the kids could of understood than they <unk> 
00:18:01	00:18:02	1	yeah 
00:18:02	00:18:17	2	like this wild woman i've kind of who was talking about you can guess what but ah i'm i was just kind of kind of put it back by the whole whoa and now it's kind of talking to her and she's like and she said well i'm always on who initiated sandwich scared of that [laughter] 
00:18:34	00:18:37	1	yeah she uh 
00:18:37	00:18:41	2	um you know it could have something to do with her blood sugar you know 
00:18:41	00:18:44	1	oh of course yeah yeah well anyway like civilization 
00:19:14	00:19:15	1	uh i don't know 
00:19:15	00:19:20	2	<unk> something about the flight recently yeah that was what it was okay so it sometimes <unk> 
00:19:20	00:19:27	1	okay i don't know i mean we'll be flying out of albuquerque around seven or something okay so you've been <unk> 
00:19:27	00:19:28	2	mhm 
00:19:28	00:19:29	1	it's about a three and a half hour 
00:19:29	00:19:32	2	yeah we're gonna probably still have all this 
00:19:32	00:19:34	1	interchange yeah 
00:19:34	00:19:41	2	exactly so um but anyway it'll be problems that will be better anyway right because we won't be driving in the middle 
00:19:41	00:19:44	1	the night yeah it's true i i got my new glasses 
00:19:44	00:19:45	2	hey how do they 
00:19:45	00:19:49	1	uh well first of all the well i sent you a letter kinda describing 
00:19:49	00:19:53	2	my folks guard about how are you uh tom treat people scrutiny 
00:19:53	00:19:55	1	they did would have 
00:19:55	00:20:04	2	well the thing was when i first got them to frames essentially you know where the the stems that bend uh-huh they were they were probably 
00:20:16	00:20:20	2	well when i get 'em back it looks like somebody's has fun with them or something either they <unk> 
00:20:20	00:20:23	1	put lenses than there were a little bit 
00:20:23	00:20:28	2	not cut quite right uh so they actually would spread they spread them out a little bit 
00:20:29	00:20:34	2	spread i mean they were like the they were loose <unk> they were unwieldy on my face 
00:20:34	00:20:42	1	that's really weird and so i was sort of in order to go back what's that did you go back and tell them to
