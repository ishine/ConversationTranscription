00:00:00	00:00:03	1	all right jeff will ah what do you think of capital punishment 
00:00:03	00:00:19	2	well um currently i actually live in virginia and virginia does have the death penalty [noise] but um obviously it has to be <unk> what we have decided on the weather is whether it's right for a certain crimes or not mhm mhm um 
00:00:19	00:00:28	1	well i i think there are certain crimes that that it's it's definitely a cold for such as like the er murdering as a cop or 
00:00:28	00:00:39	2	well yeah along those lines yeah so <unk> along definitely along those lines uh i don't have any uh i don't say this uh [noise] i'm not 
00:00:39	00:00:45	1	rebuilt <unk> rehabilitation of yeah uh certain of criminals to do certain things 
00:00:45	00:00:49	2	true you know things like ah like jeffrey dahmer 
00:00:49	00:00:51	1	you know right killing people 
00:00:51	00:00:58	2	mutilated him and and obviously uh uh doing very weird thing i don't have any 
00:00:58	00:01:00	1	have any problem ah 
00:01:00	00:01:10	2	giving him the capital punishment punishment at all there's uh i think <unk> in a society you have to draw a line somewhere and say hey you crosses the line that's it 
00:01:10	00:01:11	1	there's there's 
00:01:11	00:01:27	2	there's no chance of rehabilitation besides the fact of what rehabilitation actually costs and the and the cost of keeping someone in jail on uh a life sentence as opposed to the death penalty exactly that's another thing to look at what what the taxpayers have to pay and the different than cost 
00:01:27	00:01:30	1	sure sure i costs every one of us to ah to support that person 
00:01:30	00:01:36	2	and right you know shoot that's uh you may be locked up but it's uh it's still room and 
00:01:36	00:01:43	1	right and basically paying for him to <unk> stay alive exactly if you pull the general public who would want to keep them alive is another question 
00:01:43	00:01:49	2	[laughter] yeah i agree you know you know you can't go and i for and i i i guess on every 
00:01:49	00:01:51	1	no no it doesn't work on every issue 
00:01:51	00:02:09	2	you know and it has to be i think you have to define that uh fairly uh carefully so that you know it isn't an <unk> an abuse thing but the one thing that uh that it ought to be as ah you ought to know exactly what's gonna happen in there ought to be a timeframe for it to happen 
00:02:09	00:02:10	1	<unk> 
00:02:10	00:02:22	2	well in other words uh you put somebody on on death row and and you can go on for ten or fifteen years appealing appealing it right you know there are there ought to be you know i'm not saying it ought to be like you know two weeks and then you go 
00:02:22	00:02:24	1	but uh 
00:02:34	00:02:45	2	yeah exactly exactly [laughter] very speedy all the way down the line i guess mhm it's uh you know it's it's a tough thing to decide but uh 
00:02:45	00:02:51	1	so um i guess that would fall under the category premeditated murder what what other crimes 
00:02:51	00:02:52	2	mhm 
00:02:52	00:03:01	2	[noise] goodness ah i hadn't really thought much much past that uh you know something like bank fraud or something like that certainly does not 
00:03:01	00:03:04	1	no white collar crime doesn't exactly fall into it 
00:03:04	00:03:08	2	you know when you get into things like child molestation 
00:03:08	00:03:10	1	and rape though that's 
00:03:10	00:03:13	2	<unk> you know i'm not sure about that 
00:03:28	00:03:31	1	and and how can you how can you put someone's life up against that 
00:03:31	00:03:41	2	yeah you're you're you're right about that but when you get down to uh i guess what's the in texas called aggravated rape which is basically uh 
00:03:41	00:03:43	1	brutal beating type 
00:03:43	00:03:54	2	type attack mhm i don't know there there are certain <unk> certain aspects of that that i would have to think would would fall under that 
00:03:54	00:03:57	1	what about ah methods of of the death penalty 
00:03:57	00:04:00	2	which which er i guess 
00:04:00	00:04:01	1	well texas we have <unk> 
00:04:05	00:04:12	2	if you want to call the preferred method i preferred method i don't think anybody does what looks cute anymore do they um 
00:04:12	00:04:21	1	i don't know i think there there may be what makes there'll be one or two states to do um i have against <unk> i know without yeah gas is out 
00:04:21	00:04:27	2	well i mean ah when gary gilmore guy was executed in nevada 
00:04:27	00:04:34	1	cautious about probably about eight eight or ten years ago now or even probably fifteen he was you know putting her in put it in front of a fire <unk> fire 
00:04:34	00:04:35	2	go ahead 
00:04:35	00:04:35	1	[noise] it seems 
00:04:35	00:04:41	2	little <unk> exactly yeah it's a bit archaic [laughter] um 
00:04:41	00:04:44	1	i mean regardless it should be quick and 
00:04:44	00:04:46	2	yeah it should be quick and pay less 
00:04:46	00:04:50	1	yeah i hate to say painless because but you know 
00:04:50	00:04:53	2	well as opposed to you know chopping off fingers 
00:04:53	00:04:55	1	right 
00:04:55	00:04:57	2	spring yeah suffering is uh
