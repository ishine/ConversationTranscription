00:06:05	00:06:06	1	so you understand where you didn't do that

00:27:34	00:27:41	2	yeah but you're right if it's if it's in june that way i don't have to worry about traveling in michigan we don't have to worry about being thought

00:28:22	00:28:30	2	no i'm sure because when i have that calling card yeah it always says you have three minutes left and then pretty 
00:28:30	00:28:33	1	we're gonna have to wait a minute left him at the latest huh 
00:28:33	00:28:40	2	and then it says well i know i got thirty minutes free anyway so that's okay and then it and and that uh 
00:28:40	00:28:41	1	mhm 
00:28:41	00:28:49	2	on those calling cards <unk> you have one minute left and then that's it you're like saying divide and all of a sudden dial tone

00:29:06	00:29:16	2	he does just made another another uh good those score i don't think the raiders and scored at all i think it's probably about the way it was the forty niners in dallas 
00:29:16	00:29:17	1	good 
00:29:17	00:29:18	2	fourteen nothing 
00:29:18	00:29:22	1	<unk> oh yeah build 'em at that level 
00:29:22	00:29:26	2	i've just intimidated with forty nine

00:29:32	00:29:39	2	yeah they said they were just out there total confused because they they were running around trying to get there 
00:29:39	00:29:41	1	nothing would work for 'em because
