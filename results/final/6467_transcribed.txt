00:06:54	00:06:59	2	ah they're bankers i mean they they couldn't really all our bank 'cause you learn that after uh 
00:06:59	00:07:01	1	<unk> right 
00:07:01	00:07:04	2	uh they're not um 
00:07:04	00:07:06	1	they're not consult 
00:07:06	00:07:14	2	mhm um as as many of like to think they are they're uh they're bankers and um there's a there's the 
00:07:14	00:07:18	1	equity people i mean there's the that people 
00:07:18	00:07:25	2	and then there's the strategic advisory people mhm um and there's and the 
00:07:25	00:07:28	1	people they ah they actually people are all about 
00:07:28	00:07:32	2	trying to raise a equity for <unk> 
00:07:32	00:07:37	1	that's what david yeah you you were already capital markets that sounds really 
00:07:37	00:07:38	2	right 
00:07:38	00:07:40	1	i can't remember that is what it used to do 
00:07:40	00:07:42	2	right and that's where 
00:07:42	00:07:44	1	that's why i guess they would 
00:07:52	00:08:04	2	creating uh uh uh deposit toilet seats in the united states for foreign companies and so forth right all sorts of things just to raise capital on public markets 
00:08:05	00:08:16	2	and then there's the debt decide which is um decide which deals and bonds mhm they they go out and they try and find buyers for bombs 
00:08:16	00:08:19	1	usual investments 
00:08:19	00:08:34	2	and then you've got the um uh the traders are stocks and bonds and very <unk> and and the <unk> i don't know if they do foreign exchange but i'm sure they do have even that heavy and stuff and then aside from all those clear cut kind of special 
00:08:34	00:08:36	1	uh 
00:08:40	00:08:41	1	at least the big ones 
00:08:41	00:08:51	2	by goldman sachs' and others have there's for teaching advisors services now goldman sachs' it works for dodge telecom being privatization um 
00:09:05	00:09:07	1	the stock exchange is 
00:09:07	00:09:12	2	in tokyo and new york <unk> uh frankfurt london and so forth 
00:09:12	00:09:14	1	but 
00:09:14	00:09:18	2	the investment banks that arriving me crazy are always strategic investors 
00:09:18	00:09:19	1	because they show up and they 
00:09:19	00:09:30	2	they're out there to do is there's a lot of companies that that can't either can't raise money or they can't raise the type of money they want on the stock exchange is they don't have enough credit willingness to 
00:09:30	00:09:35	1	bond mhm um uh so the way they want to get 
00:09:35	00:09:43	2	<unk> is through offering they strategic stake in their companies selling a piece of the company 
00:09:43	00:09:47	1	um uh <unk> you know uh 
00:09:47	00:09:49	2	the changes hands privately 
00:09:49	00:09:53	1	selling a piece of the company to a foreign investors 
00:09:53	00:09:56	2	but this is only eighteen you yeah 
00:09:56	00:09:58	1	so for example 
00:09:58	00:10:09	2	i mean um without uh bring to your real deals mhm um companies will come on <unk> you know 
00:10:09	00:10:11	1	there there's a lot of uh a lot of 
00:10:11	00:10:14	2	telecommunication companies that that 
00:10:23	00:10:24	1	uh uh 
00:10:41	00:10:42	1	and and and 
00:10:42	00:10:54	2	structure of the company and then together they'll go uh go to the stock market and it's an opportunity is a big opportunity for a lot of companies out there 
00:10:54	00:10:57	1	that what you're dealing with that's your realm of 
00:10:57	00:10:59	2	partly yes um 
00:10:59	00:11:00	1	i work in an area 
00:11:00	00:11:19	2	uh which is involved in international or foreign investments mhm um and and actually the whole range of of foreign business and um you know one area is our global partnership with sprint and france dot com and another area is our foreign foreign investments 
00:11:20	00:11:26	2	and so uh we get all these like i say we got a that's a nice coming to us and 
00:11:26	00:11:28	1	uh 
00:11:28	00:11:38	2	you know their <unk> their their sales and i mean they they they've got something to hard uh some companies that come to them and they said find a some buyer and uh 
00:11:38	00:11:44	1	[noise] it uh they really can get on your nerves 
00:11:44	00:11:50	2	so what were you going to go to tokyo for for example or what did you go to hong kong four well 
00:11:50	00:11:55	1	we're uh those are just consultation oh man 
00:11:55	00:11:57	2	[laughter] 
00:11:57	00:12:00	1	but like with <unk> with companies that you might invest in 
00:12:00	00:12:06	2	with with an investment banks within a company is yeah 
00:12:08	00:12:11	2	the uh financial market area 
00:12:11	00:12:21	1	yeah that's i mean unfortunately it's actually been quite good it's been quite interesting uh i never knew anything about really that area before having that tape recording was financial markets 
00:12:21	00:12:26	2	<unk> class really <unk> uh i mean you hadn't taken 
00:12:32	00:12:34	1	how do you know how you 
00:12:34	00:12:44	2	uh what what you were in a what a strategic sale wise investment bank to do and so i <unk> that's actually been quite interesting learning of that um 
00:12:44	00:12:48	1	but at the end of the day uh 
00:12:48	00:13:02	2	that's kind of a prerequisite that kind of knowledge of of what the opportunities are kind of a deal uh what kind of a deal um uh what's what's a business opportunity 
00:13:02	00:13:13	1	mhm um is essential to do the to do the job but um it's not i wouldn't say it's the main focus 
00:13:13	00:13:16	2	so what i should be doing mhm 
00:13:16	00:13:22	1	planning um it's more general that in a sense it's a step back from the deal making 
00:13:22	00:13:30	2	um which is done by the new business development people usually and i take a step back and it's more and and the 
00:13:30	00:13:34	1	the word the strategic planner usually does yeah 
00:13:34	00:13:46	2	the market so for example i would analyze asia i look at asia and i'd see uh divide the market up into into segments such as 
00:13:46	00:13:48	1	<unk> uh uh 
00:13:48	00:13:50	2	<unk> 
00:13:50	00:13:50	1	uh-huh 
00:13:50	00:14:02	2	or value added <unk> data data services for business customers or cable t._v. um and maybe mogul uh mogul uh cellular service 
00:14:02	00:14:03	1	mhm 
00:14:03	00:14:11	2	and to you know uh business segments and i would look across the countries of the region and i would see 
00:14:11	00:14:14	1	where the growth potential is the greatest 
00:14:14	00:14:21	2	and um you know where the market's i'm mature enough where the 
00:14:21	00:14:22	1	uh-huh 
00:14:22	00:14:31	2	<unk> regulatory environment is liberal enough that you could actually get in um and you can own a company and not have problems 
00:14:31	00:14:34	1	with uh government mhm 
00:14:34	00:14:45	2	and then then you look and just basically where <unk> are there any opportunities out there are any other governments from the giving out new license like in the united states with all p._c._s. license or 
00:14:45	00:14:47	1	with uh the 
00:14:47	00:14:51	2	reforming of the u._s. type of occasions system 
00:15:25	00:15:27	1	yeah it was months ago i was <unk> it was 
00:15:27	00:15:28	2	[laughter] 
00:15:28	00:15:39	1	you know in a while ago yeah it was a while ago but um we uh i guess it's it's <unk> it's it's 
00:15:39	00:15:50	2	interesting this whole learning a little bit about like corporate finance and mm and i just subscribe to use the kind of what i what 
00:15:50	00:15:57	1	that's pretty to plan or actually should be doing um i can't say i get around to doing that for hours and um 
00:15:57	00:16:02	2	it's it's been interesting but the other hand it's not been bringing home feeling 
00:16:02	00:16:03	1	mhm um 
00:16:03	00:16:24	2	because i see a great deal potential to do a lot of things to learn a lot of things but we don't get around and we just don't get around it very much that they just they haven't um we haven't figured out quite uh that i mean we we have too many things to do with two people 
00:16:24	00:16:25	1	right yeah 
00:16:25	00:16:29	2	and so we uh as a consequence don't get really anything 
00:16:29	00:16:31	1	[laughter] and there's two phew 
00:16:31	00:16:43	2	uh and and the few people that we do have that aren't really gung ho and and on guys you'd want to um you know want to get a lot of things done but 
00:16:43	00:16:45	1	a lot of them are not as 
00:16:45	00:16:50	2	no i i consider myself a novice mhm and then i i'm going to learn all this on the job and 
00:16:50	00:16:53	1	uh you know i can do 
00:16:53	00:17:00	2	that it just you know it takes time um i uh i i started over with 
00:17:00	00:17:08	1	this job almost a year ago now and i mean this particular job i was been there i've been there for a year and a half 
00:17:09	00:17:11	1	did you find out about a year ago 
00:17:11	00:17:19	2	uh it's um been uh uh you know 
00:17:19	00:17:22	1	i thought when i came out i would you know three months we have 
00:17:22	00:17:31	2	some strategic planning on the table and not yet well it's take a little longer than i thought and partly because there's a lotta people that are just 
00:17:31	00:17:32	1	mhm 
00:17:32	00:17:42	2	and and and you know people will learn from each other but it's you know it's like it's like a couple of bad tennis players learning from each other 
00:17:42	00:17:44	1	<unk> you gotta have a few good 
00:17:44	00:17:57	2	players out there to to kind of coach young and and and then you just gotta play hard ball you know or it's mixing metaphors but play hard and and and you pick it up and you learn it but 
00:17:57	00:17:59	1	yeah 
00:17:59	00:18:12	2	we have this this habit of relying on you know the same old people and not respect in the fact that you just need new qualified fresh blood that knows what they're doing 
00:18:12	00:18:13	1	right 
00:18:13	00:18:15	2	and so 
00:18:15	00:18:16	1	i can't say that's really 
00:18:16	00:18:17	2	mhm 
00:18:17	00:18:23	1	uh been all that fulfilling it's it's been interesting and and and my my bosses have always 
00:18:23	00:18:26	2	uh been been good and and and 
00:18:26	00:18:30	1	we've gotten along well and they seem to like the work that i do so 
00:18:30	00:18:43	2	uh so so they reward me and i i continue to do my job but um uh a month after month i keep thinking it's yeah it's got to get better 
00:18:43	00:18:45	1	yeah 
00:18:45	00:18:46	2	but 
00:19:02	00:19:03	1	mhm 
00:19:03	00:19:16	2	and uh if you know if the if if uh some point if i get tired of the job i mean if some point at some point i think it's just a matter of time before i say 
00:19:16	00:19:19	1	[noise] yeah that's it 
00:19:19	00:19:22	2	right oh lord
