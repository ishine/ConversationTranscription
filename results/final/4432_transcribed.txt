00:00:50	00:00:54	2	you couldn't call me you're going to be able to call me when you on your <unk> 
00:00:54	00:01:00	1	the credit card i was trying to it's cheaper to use their uh telephone prepaid telephone card here 
00:01:00	00:01:02	2	right you had mentioned that in your email 
00:01:02	00:01:03	1	get that tour 
00:01:03	00:01:04	2	you can't get it to work 
00:01:04	00:01:06	1	well but 
00:01:06	00:01:21	2	somebody's got to be able to get it to work at other people have gotten into her right people used to be [laughter] i'm sorry i'm sorry oh i had all kinds of things to ask him i can't remember what they were i haven't i don't know but how about winning my coming home swimming coming home one day it's twenty eight 
00:01:21	00:01:26	1	oh he <unk> he did tell me that nine forty eight am forty is different from 
00:01:26	00:01:36	2	yeah he gave me around seven i don't know and ah are you working no i have to go to school that day so you in the twenty ninth 
00:01:44	00:01:55	2	<unk> i thought i didn't have classes on monday when i told you that so i fixed it at one point and then you didn't notice the fixing you liked the twenty eight twenty nine 
00:01:55	00:01:57	1	that [laughter] 
00:01:57	00:01:58	2	hum

00:02:02	00:02:04	1	huh when are you going 
00:02:04	00:02:12	2	well i'd have to leave probably around noon so that's what i mean it's like if your plane is it all the wage than like i can't be there 
00:02:12	00:02:14	1	and that's the best case 
00:02:14	00:02:18	2	that's the point is not the way than i am there because that means they only have to drive 
00:02:18	00:02:24	1	three hours to get to class instead of wait around for two three hours before i find out i had to drive to i used to get to class 
00:02:24	00:02:36	2	[noise] but yeah i guess i'm gonna call and see because the guy who's running the class is actually in japan at the moment so it's a possibility that he's going to be late [laughter] 
00:02:36	00:02:43	1	that's a possibility that they just won't go in and it's real bad but but how often do you come back from japan after <unk>

00:02:45	00:02:46	1	very often at all
