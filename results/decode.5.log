cleaned up the kitchen a little bit and mae and got brunch salads especially good you get <unk> message <unk> hong kong <unk> and then i should know the three day early days no yeah i think i got there around noon and that's one of the three days <unk> didn't know you get there noon that means <unk> get into a hotel and everything <unk> two three <unk> and <unk> really evening you one evening okay well i do another day the problem is that like cuts down my time in singapore oh well like i i don't have that much time i had to leave on sunday [noise] do you have to make that you have to make the decision when you go to hong kong now like you change <unk> until like the twentieth i think no no no i mean once you've done any coming out here <unk> when we did they really i thought you know how the things i probably could go standby but the thing is the flights are really packed that's the trouble <unk> <unk> for <unk> hong kong wouldn't it be back right <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sudden there to hong kong or the flights back to the states and we're talking like january first and that's when everybody got it back then we're not gonna change that no no nothing missing the point the point my point is a united flight from singapore to hong kong it's one <unk> singapore hong kong you <unk> you are yeah so those flights will still be tight you wouldn't believe how much trouble i had getting reservations yeah <unk> yeah i think you're going <unk> were having <unk> all <unk> 'cause like amy <unk> was wait listed i was wait listed <unk> japan and then this this woman leigh turbush <unk> you know our friend here she's trying to go to hawaii on this week and she's been trying for for that <unk> japan hawaii <unk> for <unk> japanese <unk> who were really <unk> yeah but i'm during that time of year doesn't matter <unk> yeah you should have her it was amazing i called every airline as you know only i can do right and i called <unk> it was with much hesitancy that i called continental because i hate them that much i was on hold for ten minutes while she figured out this route i should've known that if it took her ten minutes i should've hung up she had <unk> go from like philadelphia to new york to san francisco to l._a. to hawaii to guam to hong kong to tokyo to singapore i mean she asked me everywhere <unk> was the first three thousand dollars [laughter] so i'll have to take the weeks after <unk> the only ones who [laughter] the continental though yeah that's fun good luck can you at least go business class i don't know if i cannot yeah oh by the way you were right with singapore air it's all my business class or first class goes right in front of fires right yeah they um singapore air takes you around through europe they do it that way yeah yeah that's how they like to go if if i you know i could have gone specially through hong kong right but that was more a little bit more expensive and they they they also have connections with delta yeah they'll give miles <unk> <unk> you can buy delta seats right well that's their actually they were going to send me on the that'd be what i thought it would be worth it to do that instead of the united <unk> a fewer connections but instead of connecting and i'm <unk> well i mean it is a lot further to go through japan and all that nonsense but the problem with singapore air as i have to go through new york they're j._f._k. which i now remember going from the domestic terminal too though right international <unk> and all that <unk> <unk> yeah no i mean it's just not <unk> it's not saving me much if i have to go through new york but tokyo <unk> <unk> <unk> and i have like an eight hour or five hour layover that <unk> usually crate it's not that bad by the time <unk> let <unk> know but it's annoying that i have to go through tokyo that i can't just fly from hong kong home right now i'm surprised you get <unk> they do have <unk> which <unk> where san francisco <unk> was his or hong kong san francisco yeah but you know but <unk> for us at that the other i mean at that price level i could pay more probably <unk> which maybe i'll look it maybe i'll find out how much can you get on a waiting list i'll find out when i called back to couldn't from here it's worth waiting <unk> hong kong san francisco's simpsons was much better where's tokyo take you to san francisco i don't know <unk> it's okay <unk> <unk> yeah same thing yeah well at least put yourself in the waiting list can you do that yeah probably but i have a feeling it's like a price thing might not be i mean if i can get it for a level <unk> well the waiting list <unk> come through here and you know like mine amy's have all through in in so i think it's worth getting and you're <unk> you're still not that <unk> i mean i think you're early to get on the waiting okay well i'll definitely try that and you think i should add the extra day <unk> how many days <unk> singapore remember i don't know about a week i get there i'm like monday like late late monday night like one in the morning tuesday morning tuesday morning right when i want i know but that's <unk> that's when they all right then what do you have

doesn't help it either <unk> yeah <unk> well they tell you to watch your diet are you on any <unk> know <unk> said to do know some <unk> i mean they basically said if if i know something bothers me then avoid it but there's really nothing they can do as far as preventative medicine for it uh and the medicines they used to treat it or not something they want you to stay on permanently because there's a lot of bad side effects <unk> guess cancer mainly i don't know he didn't go into all that but um [noise] anyway so when i get sick and i guess start bleeding than that then i'll have to go in and you know put me on medicine which they use steroids so till i get better and then take me back off well because both my mom and my sister have colitis <unk> and they told my sister off and on that they had come up with quite a few new medicines that could really ease her because she has you know it for quite a bit and they said there were quite a few things out there that um could <unk> <unk> you know ease her discomfort you know <unk> <unk> it doesn't get rid of it obviously but at least will make her feel a little better yeah but but i don't i was thinking i was going to go to the health food store and see what they say <unk> and things <unk> take there's so many different kinds of polite is he said he didn't really call it <unk> because you said <unk> everybody <unk> you know <unk> <unk> broad range of things and there's irritable bowel disease right and there's inflammatory right which inflammatory is what i have enough to genetic disorder where irritable is just it's more stress related type and not quite as serious because there's two different kinds of collided so i guess you said and one is the old <unk> <unk> and one is um crones colitis right and he told me within five years i'd probably have crones disease well that's what which is better than the other because the other turns into cancer they they told don that he has crones all doctors have <unk> you know for other things and they said and they talk about his other problems and they said well you know that sounds like you've got crones without further testing i can't give you a definite diagnosis but that's what it sounds like to me while he won't ever go that's <unk> um he won't ever go to have another test done and you know i had surgery they put that go yeah i've been there but they put <unk> oh so oh well he doesn't want to do any of that you know <unk> like with the marion either an animal or the you know where you have to drink it he won't even do that no he suffers weekly i mean we shouldn't let it go because you could get a lot sooner more <unk> man i i i maybe <unk> can be not very good at all well his cousins husband was in the hospital over christmas and he just got out just a couple of days before christmas [noise] um with <unk> he was just terribly terribly ill and i made it a doctor's appointment for him well before school was out it was like in may and don cancelled it because he thought 'cause it was like at two o'clock or something and <unk> was worried that he was going to get out in time you know when we had to pick up case and they said you know about a week left of school or whatever it was in all this weight and do it after school's out which would have been fine but never made another appointment <unk> so i mean unless i make an appointment for him you know and he's still seeing so many doctor effective he's back to physical therapy and his seen his doctor for his shoulder and stuff so yeah i guess he is kinda doctor <unk> but he needs to take care of themselves <unk> well that's what the doctor you know he's starting <unk> scaring me seeing all this but then he also said but you know <unk> it's <unk> sometimes with age it gets better you know he's just going to play by ear and see what happens you know you could get better and i don't have problems with your worst like it goes into remission oh really like cancers <unk> the the <unk> or crones disease both can do that but i'm just trying to have to play by ear and he uh he didn't put it down on my record 'cause he he said if he does i won't <unk> able to get insurance and that so he's gonna wait and wait and see how <unk> you have <unk> house and that <unk> yeah and how severe they are and and then he said he you know if i am more prone to him too but [noise] so <unk> we know who wants to go through that again i don't know <unk> thoughts goodness what are you sorry feeling better now are you just kinda yeah i am i still feel like it just really took a lot out i mean it was so tired <unk> and after that but <unk> how long were you in the hospital i've only in a couple of days but you know they put me out for surgery and then it seems like
